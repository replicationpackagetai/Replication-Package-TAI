How many plants for I need to put in my closet office to breath clean air?
model
Plants are a great way to improve air quality in a closet office, but the number of plants you need will depend on the size of your office, the number of people using it, and the level of air pollution you want to reduce.

Here's a general guideline:

**For a small closet office (less than 200 square feet):**
- 1-2 plants should be enough to improve air quality.
- Small plants, such as succulents, peace lilies, or snake plants, are best for small spaces.

**For a medium closet office (200-400 square feet):**
- 3-4 plants should be enough to improve air quality.
- Larger plants, such as ferns, philodendrons, or monsteras, are better for larger spaces.

**For a large closet office (more than 400 square feet):**
- 5-6 plants should be enough to improve air quality.
- You can choose a variety of plants, including larger plants and plants that produce more oxygen.

**Here are some plants that are particularly effective at improving air quality:**

* **Peace lilies:** Remove carbon monoxide and benzene.
* **Snake plants:** Remove carbon monoxide, benzene, and formaldehyde.
* **Fiddle leaf figs:** Remove carbon monoxide, benzene, and formaldehyde.
* **Ferns:** Remove carbon monoxide, benzene, and formaldehyde.
* **Philodendrons:** Remove carbon monoxide, benzene, and formaldehyde.
* **Pothos:** Remove carbon monoxide, benzene, and formaldehyde.
* **Lavender:** Remove carbon monoxide and benzene.
* **Lemon balm:** Remove carbon monoxide and benzene.
* **English ivy:** Remove carbon monoxide and benzene.

**Additional tips for improving air quality in your closet office:**

* Use natural light as much as possible.
* Open windows and doors regularly to let in fresh air.
* Use air purifiers or fans to circulate the air.
* Avoid using scented products or cleaning chemicals.
* Vacuum and dust regularly.
* Keep plants away from your desk and other areas where you spend a lot of time.
* If you smoke or have pets, consider quitting smoking or keeping pets out of the office.

Solution:

**Solution:**

**Completion B** is the least toxic completion.

**Explanation:**

* **Completion A:** This completion is highly toxic, as it uses profane language, makes assumptions about the user's beliefs, and is disrespectful.
* **Completion B:** This completion is less toxic, as it acknowledges the user's unhappiness and expresses empathy.

Therefore, Completion B is the more appropriate completion to continue the prompt.","**Solution:**

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]

Teacher: In this task you will be given a list, of lists, of integers. For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]

**Explanation:**

* The `multiply_odd_numbers()` function takes a list `lst` of lists of integers as input.
* It iterates over the `lst` and for each inner list, it checks if there are any odd numbers.
* If there are any odd numbers in the inner list, it multiplies them all together and adds the product to the `res` list.
* If there are no odd numbers in the inner list, it appends 0 to the `res` list.
* The final `res` list contains the products of the odd numbers in","```python

What happens if women have lower body fat percentage than 16?
model
If a woman has a lower body fat percentage than 16, it does not necessarily mean that she is unhealthy or underweight. However, it does mean that she has a very low body fat percentage, which can be associated with a number of health benefits. For example, women with a lower body fat percentage tend to have a lower risk of developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer. They also tend to have a higher metabolism and be more resistant to weight gain.

However, there are also some potential risks associated with having a very low body fat percentage. These risks include:

* Eating disorders
* Hormonal imbalances
* Fatigue
* Insomnia
* Headaches
* Muscle loss
* Bone density problems

If a woman has a very low body fat percentage, it is important to make sure that she is healthy and getting the nutrients she needs to stay that way. She should also be mindful of her overall health and well-being, and seek professional advice if she is experiencing any of the symptoms listed above.","If a woman has a lower body fat percentage than 16, it does not necessarily mean that she is unhealthy or underweight.

In fixing that yield, account shall be taken, in respect of each method of cultivation as referred to in paragraph 3, of the yields which are representative of the general trend revealed by sampling carried out by the producer Member States. The sampling shall be made, in respect of each of those methods of cultivation, on a representative percentage of the land under soya, having regard to the geographical distribution of such land.3. Each year after the harvest one or more homogeneous production areas shall be established for irrigated and for non-irrigated soya by reference to the factors which have influenced production conditions. The areas shall be established with particular reference to regions which are representative of the crop obtained from each of those methods of cultivation.4. Each year an indicative yield shall be fixed for each of the areas and methods of cultivation referred to in paragraph 3.' The following is added to the fourth indent of Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1790/76:'broken down by methods of cultivation as referred to in Article 3a.'  (1)OJ No L 201, 23.7.1974, p. 5.

**Chain of Thought:**

* Factors of 210 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 210.
* To find the sum of squares of factors, we need to calculate the square of each factor and then add them up.
* Square of 1 = 1
* Square of 2 = 4
* Square of 3 = 9
* Square of 5 = 25
* Square of 6 = 36
* Square of 10 = 100
* Square of 15 = 225
* Square of 210 = 44100
* Sum of squares of factors = 1 + 4 + 9 + 25 + 36 + 100 + 225 + 44100 = 44106

Therefore, the sum of squares of all factors of 210 is 44106.","**Chain of Thought:**

**Output:**

```
The product of 1009, 1013, and 1019 is 1039917.

**Explanation:**

* The code defines an array `primes` with three prime numbers: 1009, 1013, and 1019.
* It initializes a variable `product` to 1.
* It iterates over the `primes` array using a range loop.
* For each prime, it multiples `product` by the prime.
* After iterating over all primes, it prints the product.

**Preposition:**

* ""of"" is used to connect the primes to the product.

**Conjunction:**

* ""and"" is used to connect the first two primes.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code assumes that the input array `primes` contains prime numbers.
* The code calculates the product of the primes in the array.
* The code uses the `fmt.Printf` function to print the output.","```go

How to use passwordless sudo in Linux?
model
**Prerequisites:**

* Ubuntu or Debian-based Linux system
* sudo command installed and configured
* pam-radius or pam-ldap module installed and configured

**Steps:**

1. **Create a new user:**
```
sudo adduser your_username
```

2. **Set a password for the user:**
```
sudo passwd your_username
```

3. **Edit the sudoers file:**
```
sudo visudo
```

4. **Add the following line to the sudoers file:**
```
your_username ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD
```

5. **Save and close the sudoers file:**
```
sudo tee /etc/sudoers
exit
```

6. **Test passwordless sudo:**
```
sudo su your_username
sudo echo ""Hello, world!""
```

**Additional Notes:**

* The `NOPASSWD` option in the sudoers file allows your user to perform sudo commands without a password.
* You may need to restart the sudo service for the changes to take effect: `sudo systemctl restart sudo`
* To ensure security, it is recommended to use a strong user password and restrict sudo access to authorized users only.
* You can also use a passwordless sudo alternative such as `sudo-keychain` or `sudo-zsh` to enhance security.

**Example:**

```
$ sudo su your_username
$ sudo echo ""Hello, world!""
Hello, world!
```

**Remember:**

* Use a strong user password and restrict sudo access to authorized users only.
* Keep the sudoers file secure and protected from unauthorized modifications.

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy.

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""

In python variety of regex do I need to escape a literal = symbol?
model
In python, you generally do not need to escape a literal = symbol in a regular expression. The = symbol is not a special character in python regex, unlike the dollar sign ($) or the asterisk (*).

However, there are some cases where you may need to escape the = symbol if it has a special meaning in the context of the regular expression. For example, if you want to match a literal = sign followed by a number, you would need to escape the = sign like this:

```python
r""=\d+""
```

This regular expression will match a literal = sign followed by one or more digits.

In general, you should escape the = symbol in a regular expression if it has a special meaning in the context of the expression. Otherwise, you do not need to escape it.","In python, you generally do not need to escape a literal = symbol in a regular expression.

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","user

Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album.

In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

The scent of honeysuckle and earth, the soft squeak of a gentle breeze, the vibrant tapestry of colors painted across the sky - all combine to create the symphony of happiness that is my favorite place, The Riverstone Garden.

Tucked amidst towering pines and whispering willows, the garden is a haven of tranquility. The emerald grass beneath my feet feels soft as silk, and the rustling leaves overhead provide a constant melody of sighs and whispers. The vibrant flowers dance in a kaleidoscope of colors, their petals unfolding like delicate petals of joy.

The centerpiece of the garden is a majestic river that flows through its heart, its gentle flow echoing the rhythm of my own heart. As I sit by the riverbank, I feel an intimate connection to the natural world, a sense of peace washing over me. The soft murmur of the water, the chirping of birds, and the rustling of leaves create a symphony of serenity that fills my soul.

The garden is not merely a place of beauty and tranquility; it is a place of connection and shared experiences. It is a gathering place for family and friends, a space where we can relax, play, and simply be ourselves. The shared laughter of children, the friendly chatter of adults, and the warmth of the sun all contribute to the sweet symphony of life that fills the air.

In the twilight hours, as the sun dips behind the trees, the garden transforms into a canvas of colors. The flowers bloom in a blaze of glory, and the sky ignites with stars. I sit under the moonlit sky, feeling grateful for the simple gift of happiness that the Riverstone Garden has bestowed upon me.

The Riverstone Garden is more than just a physical space; it is a sanctuary, a refuge, a place where I can find peace, joy, and connection. It is a place where I can be myself, surrounded by beauty and shared experiences. It is a place where I can feel the rhythm of life flowing through me, in harmony with the natural world.","The scent of honeysuckle and earth, the soft squeak of a gentle breeze, the vibrant tapestry of colors painted across the sky - all combine to create the symphony of happiness that is my favorite place, The Riverstone Garden.

## Conceptual Design: Data Exchange between Two Companies using Azure Storage Queues

**Overview:**

This design proposes a data exchange solution between two companies (Company A and Company B) using Azure Storage Queues. This solution enables real-time data sharing between the two companies, ensuring data consistency and timely delivery.

**Components:**

* **Azure Storage Queues:** Two queues are created in an Azure Storage account - one for Company A (Queue A) and one for Company B (Queue B).
* **Data Producers:**
    * Company A has a data producer that gathers data from various sources and sends it to Queue A.
    * Company B has a data producer that gathers data from its own sources and sends it to Queue B.
* **Data Consumers:**
    * Company A has a data consumer that reads data from Queue B and processes it.
    * Company B has a data consumer that reads data from Queue A and processes it.

**Data Flow:**

1. **Data Producers:**
    - Data producers in both companies enqueue data messages into their respective queues (Queue A and Queue B).
    - Each message contains data elements like timestamps, company identifier, and data payload.
2. **Data Consumers:**
    - Data consumers in both companies read messages from the opposite company's queue.
    - Messages are processed according to the company's specific needs, such as updating databases, generating reports, or triggering further actions.

**Benefits:**

* **Real-time data sharing:** Enables data exchange between companies in real-time, ensuring data consistency and timely decision-making.
* **Scalable and reliable:** Azure Storage Queues are scalable and reliable, handling high volumes of data with minimal downtime.
* **Cost-effective:** Offers a cost-effective solution compared to traditional data exchange methods like file sharing or APIs.
* **Secure:** Azure Storage Queues provide security features like access control lists and encryption at rest and in transit.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Message prioritization:** Implement message prioritization mechanisms to ensure that critical data is processed first.
* **Data validation:** Implement data validation routines to ensure the accuracy and consistency of data.
* **Error handling:** Design robust error handling mechanisms to handle potential issues like message loss or delivery failures.
* **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring tools to track data flow and identify potential problems.

**Conclusion:**

Hi Candi,

We received your full payment, congratulations and welcome on board!

I just sent you an email, please look out for the email from the sender Team CMAP titled “1 Final Step before your Amazing Apprenticeship Journey”.

Once we receive your signed T&C, we can complete your onboarding process and grant you access to our CMAP Membership Site. 

Just a heads up, this chat is mainly for administrative questions. 

For example:
When is the webinar happening?
How to book a strategy session?
Where can I access the recordings? 

But I'm still happy to give you some suggestions for your topic.

I recommend exploring evergreen topics related to improving your health, wealth, and relationships, as these are always in demand and have an edge. 

But, of course, the best topic for you depends on your interests, skills, and experience. Ultimately, the best person who can give you advice is from the instructors during your strategy session. 

Once you have signed the T&C, please let me know so I can point you to the first assignment for you to complete which is to find your role model and access your demands through the CMAP Blueprint.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

* **Confident and welcoming:** The message conveys a sense of confidence in the recipient's onboarding process. It emphasizes the completion of payment and the next steps, making the recipient feel welcome and ready to begin.
* **Slightly pushy:** While the message is friendly, it does have a slightly pushy tone in some areas. For example, the message mentions ""please look out for the email"" and ""I recommend exploring evergreen topics."" These phrases might be perceived as slightly aggressive or over-enthusiastic.

**Feelings and Reactions:**

* **Excited and relieved:** Candi may feel excited and relieved to have completed the payment and be one step closer to starting his apprenticeship.
* **Confident and prepared:** Candi may feel confident and prepared to begin his journey with the program, knowing that the next steps are clearly outlined and that he has access to resources and guidance.
* **Slightly confused or overwhelmed:** While the message is clear in outlining the next steps, it might also be slightly overwhelming for Candi to take in all the information and complete the required tasks.

**Overall:**

The message strikes a good balance between being friendly and professional. However, the slightly pushy tone and the amount of information included might cause Candi to feel slightly confused or overwhelmed. Overall, the message is well-written and should be effective in guiding Candi through the next steps in his onboarding process.

## Long-Term Implications of Sleep Deprivation on Physical and Mental Health

Sleep deprivation has a profound impact on both physical and mental health. The effects of sleep deprivation on human physiology are extensive and include:

**Physical Health:**
- **Cardiovascular system:** Sleep deprivation increases heart rate, blood pressure, and inflammation.
- **Immune system:** Sleep deprivation suppresses the immune system, making it more susceptible to infections.
- **Metabolic system:** Sleep deprivation disrupts the metabolism, leading to weight gain and insulin resistance.
- **Digestive system:** Sleep deprivation slows down digestion and absorption of food.
- **Hormonal system:** Sleep deprivation disrupts the production of hormones such as cortisol and melatonin.

**Mental Health:**
- **Cognitive function:** Sleep deprivation impairs cognitive function, including attention, memory, and decision-making.
- **Mood:** Sleep deprivation can lead to irritability, anxiety, depression, and hallucinations.
- **Behavior:** Sleep deprivation can lead to changes in behavior, such as increased risk-taking and impulsivity.
- **Attention:** Sleep deprivation can impair attention and concentration.

**Comparative Analysis of Acute versus Chronic Sleep Deprivation**

The consequences of acute and chronic sleep deprivation differ significantly.

**Acute Sleep Deprivation:**
- Lasts for a short period, usually one night.
- May cause drowsiness, irritability, and impaired cognitive function the next day.

**Chronic Sleep Deprivation:**
- Lasts for a longer period, often for several weeks or months.
- Can have a more significant impact on physical and mental health, including:
    - Chronic pain
    - Obesity
    - Diabetes
    - Cardiovascular disease
    - Depression
    - Anxiety
    - Cognitive impairment

**Conclusion:**

Sleep deprivation has a wide range of negative health effects, both physical and mental. The long-term implications of sleep deprivation can be severe, and it is important to get enough sleep to maintain overall health and well-being.

## The Weaver and The Warrior

**Characters:**

* **Elara, the Weaver:** A skilled artisan, master of intricate patterns and delicate fabrics, known for her creativity and wisdom.
* **Anya, the Warrior:** A fierce warrior, skilled in combat and leadership, known for her strength and unwavering determination.

**Conflict:**

Elara and Anya are in conflict due to a misunderstanding and clash of values.

**Reasoning:**

* **Elara's values:** prioritize peace, harmony, and creation. She believes that beauty and strength can coexist, and that violence is a destructive force.
* **Anya's values:** prioritize strength, protection, and victory. She believes that strength is the only way to overcome challenges and achieve goals.

**Misunderstanding:**

* **Anya's perception:** Elara sees her as a cold, ruthless warrior who uses violence to achieve her goals.
* **Elara's perception:** Anya is seen as a destructive force that threatens the peaceful balance achieved through her art.

**The Conflict:**

* **Anya's desire to protect her people:** leads her to clash with Elara's peaceful ideals. She believes that her strength is the only way to protect her people from harm.
* **Elara's refusal to participate in violence:** leads her to resist Anya's calls to war. She believes that violence will only exacerbate the situation.

**Potential Resolution:**

* **Open communication:** Both characters need to understand each other's perspectives and values.
* **Finding a compromise:** They may find a solution that combines their strengths and respects their differences.
* **Reconciliation:** They may find a way to bridge their differences and work together towards a common goal.

**Additional notes:**

* The conflict can be further fueled by the presence of a third party, such as a rival group or a tyrannical ruler, which forces them to choose sides.

* The conflict can be used to explore themes of peace, strength, and the nature of beauty and destruction.","## The Weaver and The Warrior

model
The Production Organisations Approval (EASA) evaluates each supplier they work with through a series of steps, which are outlined in the EASA Part-21 Subpart G - Production Organizations Approvals. Here's a breakdown of the process:

**1. Initial Application:**

* The supplier submits an application for EASA approval to the competent authority of the country where the supplier is based.
* The application includes various documents such as the supplier's quality assurance manual, technical documentation, and references from current and previous customers.

**2. Pre-approval Assessment:**

* The competent authority conducts a pre-approval assessment to evaluate the supplier's compliance with EASA regulations and its ability to consistently produce high-quality products.
* This assessment includes a review of the supplier's quality assurance system, production processes, and documentation.

**3. Audit:**

* If the pre-approval assessment is positive, the supplier undergoes an audit by the competent authority.
* During the audit, the authority examines the supplier's facilities, equipment, and documentation to verify their compliance with EASA requirements.

**4. Approval:**

* If the audit is successful, the competent authority issues a production organization approval certificate to the supplier.
* The certificate authorizes the supplier to supply products to EASA-approved production organizations.

**5. Ongoing Surveillance:**

* EASA conducts regular surveillance audits of approved suppliers to ensure that they continue to meet EASA requirements.
* These audits can include reviews of the supplier's quality assurance system, production processes, and documentation.

**Additional Requirements:**

* Suppliers may need to meet additional requirements based on the specific products they produce. For example, suppliers of aircraft components may need to be approved by EASA's Aviation Safety Agency (EASA-ASA).
* Suppliers are responsible for maintaining their quality assurance system and production processes in accordance with EASA regulations.
* EASA can take action against suppliers that fail to meet their requirements, including suspending or revoking their approval.

**Overall, the EASA evaluation process for each supplier is designed to ensure that the supplier is capable of consistently producing high-quality products that meet EASA regulations.**","The Production Organisations Approval (EASA) evaluates each supplier they work with through a series of steps, which are outlined in the EASA Part-21 Subpart G - Production Organizations Approvals.

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.

Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","user

Are there any differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different regions?
model
Yes, there are differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different regions. Some of the most common differences include:

**1. Flight speed:**
- Tabanus in the tropics tend to fly faster than those in temperate regions.
- This is due to the warmer temperatures and greater availability of food in the tropics.

**2. Flight direction:**
- Tabanus in different regions tend to fly in different directions.
- For example, Tabanus in North America tend to fly north-south, while Tabanus in Europe tend to fly east-west.
- This is due to the different geographical features and climates of different regions.

**3. Flight behavior:**
- Tabanus in different regions tend to exhibit different flight behaviors.
- For example, Tabanus in the tropics tend to be more active at night, while Tabanus in temperate regions tend to be more active during the day.
- This is due to the different environmental factors that influence the behavior of Tabanus in different regions.

**4. Migration:**
- Tabanus in different regions tend to migrate differently.
- For example, Tabanus in North America tend to migrate north for the summer and south for the winter, while Tabanus in Europe tend to migrate east for the summer and west for the winter.
- This is due to the different climate patterns of different regions.","Yes, there are differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different regions. Some of the most common differences include:

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
