1. **Location**: Choose a location that is close to public transportation, schools, and other amenities to reduce the need for personal vehicles and promote walkability.
2. **Density**: Design housing developments with a higher density to reduce the amount of land needed for construction and reduce the carbon footprint of transportation.
3. **Mixed-use development**: Incorporate mixed-use development, such as residential, commercial, and recreational spaces, to reduce the need for lengthy commutes and promote a more active lifestyle.
4. **Energy-efficient design**: Incorporate energy-efficient design elements, such as insulation, double-glazed windows, and solar panels, to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions.
5. **Water conservation**: Incorporate water-saving features, such as low-flow showerheads and toilets, to reduce water consumption.
6. **Sustainable materials**: Use sustainable materials, such as recycled materials, low-VOC paints, and sustainably sourced wood, to reduce the environmental impact of construction.
7. **Green spaces**: Incorporate green spaces, such as parks, gardens, and green roofs, to provide a natural habitat for wildlife and reduce the urban heat island effect.
8. **Community engagement**: Engage with the local community to understand their needs and preferences, and incorporate their input into the design process to ensure that the development is responsive to local needs.
9. **Innovative design**: Incorporate innovative design elements, such as green walls, green roofs, and living walls, to provide a natural habitat for wildlife and reduce the urban heat island effect.
10. **Maintenance and repair**: Incorporate maintenance and repair considerations into the design process to ensure that the development is well-maintained and can be easily repaired if needed.
11. **Community facilities**: Incorporate community facilities, such as community centers, parks, and playgrounds, to provide a sense of community and promote social interaction.
12. **Accessibility**: Incorporate accessibility features, such as wheelchair ramps and elevators, to ensure that the development is accessible to all members of the community.
13. **Landscaping**: Incorporate landscaping features, such as native plants and trees, to provide a natural habitat for wildlife and reduce the urban heat island effect.
14. **Water management**: Incorporate water management features, such as rainwater harvesting and greywater reuse, to reduce water consumption and reduce the risk of flooding.
15. **Waste reduction**: Incorporate"

A 404 error typically means that the requested resource (in this case, a Docker container) is not found. Here are a few common reasons why you might be getting a 404 error when running `docker-compose up`:

1. **Docker Compose file is not in the correct location**: Make sure that your `docker-compose.yml` file is in the same directory as your project root. If it's not, you'll need to specify the path to the file using the `-f` flag, like this: `docker-compose -f /path/to/docker-compose.yml up`
2. **Docker Compose file is not correctly formatted**: Double-check that your `docker-compose.yml` file is correctly formatted and that there are no syntax errors. You can use a tool like `docker-compose validate` to check for errors.
3. **Docker Compose is not installed**: Make sure that Docker Compose is installed and running on your system. You can check by running `docker-compose --version` in your terminal.
4. **Docker Compose is not configured correctly**: Check that your `docker-compose.yml` file is correctly configured and that the `docker-compose` command is pointing to the correct directory. You can check the configuration by running `docker-compose config` in your terminal.
5. **Docker Compose is not running in the correct environment**: Make sure that you're running `docker-compose up` in the correct environment. For example, if you're running on a Linux system, make sure that you're running the command in a Linux environment, not a Windows environment.
6. **Docker Compose is not configured to use the correct Docker daemon**: Make sure that your `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to use the correct Docker daemon. You can check the configuration by running `docker-compose config` in your terminal.
7. **Docker Compose is not configured to use the correct network**: Make sure that your `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to use the correct network. You can check the configuration by running `docker-compose config` in your terminal.
8. **Docker Compose is not configured to use the correct volumes**: Make sure that your `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to use the correct volumes. You can check the configuration by running `docker-compose config` in your terminal.

Based on the passage above, Can you paraphrase the first sentence of the text and explain the author's emotional state?","The first sentence of the text is: ""Inħossni qisni forti imwaqqa', inaċċessibli."" This sentence can be paraphrased as: ""I feel like a ruined fort, inacessible.""

The author's emotional state is one of frustration, desperation, and possibly even despair. The use of the metaphor of a ruined fort suggests that the author feels like they are trapped and unable to escape their current situation. The phrase ""inaċċessibli"" (inacessible) reinforces this idea, implying that the author feels like they are cut off from the world and unable to connect with others. The author's use of vivid imagery and metaphors, such as ""a storm from the heavens"" and ""a glass of red wine spilled on a marble tile"", suggests that they are struggling to cope with their emotions and find a way to express themselves. Overall, the author's emotional state is one of intense emotional turmoil and desperation."

You can use this script as a starting point and modify it to fit your needs. You can also add more validation and error checking to ensure that the file is uploaded correctly.

Here is an example of how you can use this script:

```html
<form method=""post"" enctype=""multipart/form-data"">
    <input type=""file"" name=""file"">
    <input type=""submit"" value=""Upload"">
</form>
```

You can also use a library like PHP's built-in `upload.php` to handle file uploads."

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]

I am having difficulties with the older students complaining about the younger students and being disrespectful towards them. What are some teaching strategies or activities that encourage team building and bonding between band students?,"It's not uncommon for older students to feel frustrated with younger students, especially in a band class where there may be a significant age gap. However, it's essential to create a positive and inclusive environment where all students feel valued and respected. Here are some teaching strategies and activities that can help encourage team building and bonding between band students:

1. Icebreaker activities: Start with simple icebreaker activities that help students get to know each other. For example, have students share their favorite hobbies, sports, or music genres. This can help break down barriers and create a sense of camaraderie.
2. Team-building exercises: Organize team-building exercises that require students to work together to achieve a common goal. For example, have students work in small groups to solve a puzzle or complete a task. This can help build trust and communication among students.
3. Music-based activities: Use music to bring students together. For example, have students work in small groups to create a song or composition. This can help students bond over their shared love of music and create a sense of accomplishment.
4. Volunteer opportunities: Organize volunteer opportunities for students to work together on a project that benefits the school or community. This can help students build relationships and develop a sense of social responsibility.
5. Social events: Host social events, such as potluck dinners or movie nights, that bring students together outside of class. This can help students build relationships and create a sense of community.
6. Mentorship programs: Pair older students with younger students and have them work together on a project or task. This can help older students take on a leadership role and mentor younger students.
7. Team-building games: Organize team-building games that require students to work together to achieve a common goal. For example, have students work together to complete an obstacle course or solve a puzzle.
8. Music festivals: Host a music festival or concert where students can perform together. This can help students bond over their shared love of music and create a sense of accomplishment.
9. Community service: Organize community service projects that bring students together to help others. This can help students build relationships and develop a sense of social responsibility.
10. Team-building challenges: Organize team-building challenges that require students to work together to achieve a common goal. For example, have students work together to complete a scavenger hunt or solve a puzzle.

This is a normal and healthy range for many women, and it is not necessarily a cause for concern. However, it is important to note that body fat percentage is just one aspect of overall health and fitness, and it is not the only factor that determines a person's health or fitness level.

In general, a body fat percentage of 16% or lower is considered to be a healthy range for women because it is associated with a lower risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. It is also associated with a lower risk of osteoporosis and other bone-related disorders.

However, it is important to note that body fat percentage is just one aspect of overall health and fitness, and it is not the only factor that determines a person's health or fitness level. Other factors, such as muscle mass, bone density, and overall physical fitness, are also important to consider.

In addition, it is important to note that body fat percentage is not the same as body composition. Body composition refers to the proportion of fat and lean tissue in the body, and it is a more comprehensive measure of overall health and fitness than body fat percentage alone.

In general, a body fat percentage of 16% or lower is considered to be a healthy range for women because it is associated with a lower risk of chronic diseases and other health problems. However, it is important to note that body fat percentage is just one aspect of overall health and fitness, and it is not the only factor that determines a person's health or fitness level."

2. **Spelling and Grammar:** There are several spelling and grammar errors throughout the resume. For example, ""ISOC Holdings, Inc."" should be ""ISOC Holdings, Inc."" (no comma after ""Inc."").

3. **Job Titles:** The job titles should be in a standard format, such as ""HR Assistant - Talent Acquisition"" instead of ""HR Assistant – Talent Acquisition"".

4. **Job Responsibilities:** The job responsibilities should be in a bullet-point format, with each point starting with a verb and ending with a period. For example, ""• Handles the end-to-end process of recruitment for all shared services and verticals (business support group, property development, and cold chain logistics). 98% annual fill rate for all verticals."" should be ""• Handles end-to-end recruitment process for shared services and verticals, achieving 98% annual fill rate for all verticals.""

5. **Education:** The education section should be in a standard format, with the degree and major listed first, followed by the university name and dates attended.

Here is the revised resume:

**Perfect Market Elements and Healthcare Market Failures**

**1. Perfect Market Element: Free Entry and Exit**
	* Example: In a perfect market, anyone can enter or exit the market without restrictions.
	* Healthcare Market Failure: In the healthcare market, there are significant barriers to entry and exit, such as licensing requirements, regulatory hurdles, and high startup costs, which limit competition and innovation.

**2. Perfect Market Element: Perfect Information**
	* Example: In a perfect market, all participants have complete and accurate information about the market and its participants.
	* Healthcare Market Failure: In the healthcare market, patients often lack complete and accurate information about their medical conditions, treatment options, and healthcare providers, which can lead to poor decision-making and inefficient resource allocation.

**3. Perfect Market Element: Homogeneous Products**
	* Example: In a perfect market, all products are identical and interchangeable.
	* Healthcare Market Failure: In the healthcare market, medical treatments and services are often heterogeneous and non-interchangeable, which can lead to confusion and inefficiency in the allocation of resources.

**4. Perfect Market Element: No Externalities**
	* Example: In a perfect market, there are no externalities, such as negative environmental impacts or social costs.
	* Healthcare Market Failure: In the healthcare market, there are significant externalities, such as the impact of medical treatments on the environment and the social costs of healthcare, which are often not fully accounted for in the market.

**5. Perfect Market Element: No Monopoly Power**
	* Example: In a perfect market, no single firm has the power to influence the market price.
	* Healthcare Market Failure: In the healthcare market, many healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies have significant market power, which can lead to price gouging and inefficiency.

**6. Perfect Market Element: No Information Asymmetry**
	* Example: In a perfect market, all participants have the same information and can make informed decisions.
	* Healthcare Market Failure: In the healthcare market, there is significant information asymmetry between healthcare providers and patients, which can lead to poor decision-making and inefficient resource allocation.

**7. Perfect Market Element: No Transaction Costs**

This is achieved by creating a special user group called ""sudo"" and adding users to this group. Here's how to do it:

1. Create a new user group called ""sudo"" and add the user you want to use passwordless sudo with to this group:
```
sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>
```
Replace `<username>` with the username of the user you want to use passwordless sudo with.

2. Edit the `/etc/sudoers` file to allow the user to run commands with root privileges without a password:
```
sudo visudo
```
This will open the `/etc/sudoers` file in the default editor. Add the following line at the end of the file:
```
<username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
Replace `<username>` with the username of the user you want to use passwordless sudo with.

3. Save and exit the editor. The changes will be applied immediately.

4. Test the passwordless sudo by running a command with root privileges:
```
sudo <command>
```
Replace `<command>` with the command you want to run with root privileges. If the command is successful, you should not be prompted for a password.

Note: Make sure to use the `visudo` command to edit the `/etc/sudoers` file, as it will ensure that the file is edited correctly and safely."

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy shrank by 20.4% in the second quarter of 2020 due to the impact of the coronavirus lockdown, with Scotland's economy also experiencing a significant decline of 19.4%."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Kimmel's statement about Trump playing golf more than any other president is a critique of Trump's accomplishments because it highlights the fact that Trump has spent a significant amount of time playing golf, which is often seen as a leisure activity, rather than focusing on his presidential duties. Kimmel is suggesting that Trump's priorities are misplaced and that he should be spending more time on issues that affect the country, such as healthcare, rather than indulging in personal hobbies."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

As I walk along the winding cobblestone streets, the warm breeze carries the sweet scent of lemons and the sound of the Aegean Sea's waves crashing against the shore. The whitewashed houses, adorned with blue domes and red roofs, seem to dance in the sunlight, their beauty a testament to the town's rich history and culture.

As I make my way to the beach, the sound of the waves grows louder and the air is filled with the laughter of children playing in the shallow waters. The sun beats down upon my skin, warming my soul and filling me with a sense of peace. I breathe in deeply, taking in the salty air and the sweet scent of the sea, and feel my worries melting away.

As I sit on the beach, watching the sun set over the water, I am filled with a sense of gratitude for this place and the memories it holds. I think of the countless sunsets I've watched here, the laughter and tears I've shared with loved ones, and the countless moments of peace and tranquility I've found in this beautiful place.

As the sun dips below the horizon, the sky is painted with hues of pink and orange, and the stars begin to twinkle in the night sky. I feel a sense of contentment wash over me, knowing that I am exactly where I am meant to be. Santorini, with its breathtaking beauty and warm, welcoming spirit, is a place that fills my heart with joy and my soul with serenity. It is a place where I can be myself, where I can let go of my worries and simply be. And for that, I am eternally grateful."

**Overview**

In this design, we will use Azure Storage Queues to enable data exchange between two companies, Company A and Company B. Company A will send data to Company B through a queue, and Company B will receive data from Company A through another queue. This design assumes that both companies have Azure Storage Queues set up and are using them to exchange data.

**Components**

1. **Company A's Azure Storage Queue**: This is the queue that Company A will use to send data to Company B. It will be created in Company A's Azure Storage account.
2. **Company B's Azure Storage Queue**: This is the queue that Company B will use to receive data from Company A. It will be created in Company B's Azure Storage account.
3. **Data Producer (Company A)**: This is the application or service that will send data to Company B's Azure Storage Queue. It will be responsible for sending data to the queue and ensuring that the data is properly formatted and validated.
4. **Data Consumer (Company B)**: This is the application or service that will receive data from Company A's Azure Storage Queue. It will be responsible for retrieving data from the queue and processing it according to Company B's requirements.

**Data Exchange Process**

1. **Data Producer (Company A) sends data to Company B's Azure Storage Queue**: Company A's data producer will send data to Company B's Azure Storage Queue using the Azure Storage Queue API. The data will be sent in a JSON format and will include a unique identifier, a timestamp, and the data itself.
2. **Data is stored in Company B's Azure Storage Queue**: Once the data is sent to Company B's Azure Storage Queue, it will be stored in the queue until it is retrieved by Company B's data consumer.
3. **Data Consumer (Company B) retrieves data from Company A's Azure Storage Queue**: Company B's data consumer will retrieve data from Company A's Azure Storage Queue using the Azure Storage Queue API. The data will be retrieved in a JSON format and will include a unique identifier, a timestamp, and the data itself.

Sail is not made up of invisible air. Sail is typically made of a material such as nylon, polyester, or Dacron, which is woven into a fabric that is used to catch the wind and propel a boat forward. The wind pushes against the sail, causing it to fill with air, which then pushes against the hull of the boat, propelling it forward. The air inside the sail is not invisible, but rather it is the air that is trapped inside the sail that is used to generate the force that propels the boat."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.

Who they are and why they are in conflict.,"Let's imagine two distinct characters, a CEO of a large corporation and a local business owner. The CEO, named Rachel, is a ruthless and cunning individual who will stop at nothing to get what she wants. She is driven by her desire for power and wealth, and she has no qualms about stepping on others to get ahead. She is the CEO of a large corporation that has been expanding rapidly, and she is determined to continue to grow and expand her business at any cost.

On the other hand, the local business owner, named Jack, is a kind and compassionate individual who is dedicated to his community. He is a small business owner who has been running his family's bakery for years, and he is deeply committed to his customers and his community. He is a hard worker and is always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need.

The conflict between Rachel and Jack arises when Rachel's corporation decides to expand into Jack's community and open a new store. Jack is deeply concerned about the impact that this will have on his business and his community, and he is determined to stop Rachel from opening the store. Rachel, on the other hand, is determined to open the store and is willing to do whatever it takes to make it happen.

The conflict between Rachel and Jack is a classic example of a clash between two different values and lifestyles. Rachel is driven by her desire for power and wealth, while Jack is driven by his desire to help others and make a positive impact on his community. The conflict between them is a reflection of the larger societal conflict between those who prioritize profit and those who prioritize people."

Here are the key steps in the evaluation process:

1. Initial Contact: The supplier is contacted by EASA to discuss the possibility of working together. This is usually done through a formal letter or email.
2. Initial Assessment: EASA conducts an initial assessment of the supplier's capabilities, including their experience, expertise, and resources. This is usually done through a questionnaire or a phone call.
3. Site Visit: EASA conducts a site visit to the supplier's facilities to assess their capabilities and infrastructure. This includes evaluating the supplier's equipment, personnel, and processes.
4. Technical Evaluation: EASA evaluates the supplier's technical capabilities, including their ability to design, manufacture, and test the required components or systems.
5. Quality System Evaluation: EASA evaluates the supplier's quality system, including their procedures, documentation, and personnel training.
6. Safety Evaluation: EASA evaluates the supplier's safety procedures, including their risk management, safety culture, and incident reporting.
7. Compliance with Regulations: EASA evaluates the supplier's compliance with relevant regulations, including EU regulations, industry standards, and EASA's own regulations.
8. Final Assessment: EASA conducts a final assessment of the supplier's capabilities and infrastructure, taking into account the results of the previous steps.
9. Approval: If the supplier meets the necessary safety and quality standards, EASA grants them approval to work with the agency. This approval is usually valid for a specific period of time, and the supplier must continue to meet the necessary standards to maintain their approval.

EASA also conducts regular audits and inspections to ensure that the supplier continues to meet the necessary standards. If the supplier fails to meet the necessary standards, EASA may revoke their approval and terminate the agreement.

It's worth noting that EASA's evaluation process is based on the principles of the European Union's (EU) Regulation (EC) No 1059/2008, which sets out the requirements for the approval of suppliers of aircraft parts and equipment. The regulation requires suppliers to demonstrate that they have a quality management system in place, that they have the necessary technical capabilities, and that they comply with EU regulations and industry standards."

[INTRO MUSIC FADES OUT]

Host: Welcome to ""The Future of Power Generation"" podcast, where we explore the latest advancements in renewable energy and their impact on our planet. I'm your host, [Name], and today we're joined by [Guest 1], [Guest 2], and [Guest 3] to discuss the future of renewable energy. Let's dive right in!

[SEGMENT 1: CURRENT STATE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY]

Host: So, let's start with the current state of renewable energy. [Guest 1], can you give us an overview of where we are today?

Guest 1: Sure thing! Renewable energy has made tremendous progress in recent years. In 2020, renewable energy accounted for 36% of global power generation, up from 22% in 2010. Solar and wind power have been the driving forces behind this growth, with solar energy costs decreasing by 80% over the past decade and wind energy costs decreasing by 50%.

Host: That's impressive! [Guest 2], can you tell us more about the technological advancements that are driving this growth?

Guest 2: Absolutely! One of the key areas of innovation is in energy storage. Advances in battery technology have made it possible to store energy generated from renewable sources for longer periods, making it more viable for widespread adoption. Additionally, advancements in smart grids and grid management systems are enabling utilities to better integrate renewable energy sources into the grid.

Host: That's fascinating! [Guest 3], can you discuss the economic and political factors that impact renewable energy adoption?

Guest 3: Sure thing! Renewable energy adoption is often driven by government policies and incentives. For example, the US government's Production Tax Credit (PTC) has been a key driver of wind energy growth in the US. Additionally, many countries have set ambitious renewable energy targets, such as the European Union's goal of reaching 32% renewable energy by 2030.

Host: That's a great point. [Guest 1], can you outline the potential benefits and drawbacks of increasing renewable energy usage?

Guest 1: Sure thing! The benefits of increasing renewable energy usage are numerous. Renewable energy can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and create jobs. Additionally, renewable energy can provide energy independence and reduce reliance on foreign oil. However, there are also potential drawbacks,"

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","The ambiance and dining options at Congham Hall Hotel set it apart from other hotels in the area in several ways. Firstly, the hotel's Georgian mansion architecture and beautifully manicured grounds create a tranquil and peaceful atmosphere, perfect for relaxation and unwinding. The hotel's 2AA Rosettes food, led by executive chef James O'Connor, offers a range of delicious dishes with a focus on locally sourced ingredients, including rare-breed pork, venison, and seafood. The hotel's dining room, with its orangery-style design, provides a warm and inviting space for guests to enjoy their meals. Additionally, the hotel's spa and wellness facilities, including a swimming pool, hot tub, and a range of treatments and therapies, offer guests a chance to relax and rejuvenate."

class GroupCreateDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: str
```

Then, create a `main.py` file and define the views:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from models import GroupDTO, GroupCreateDTO

app = FastAPI()

@app.get(""/groups/"")
async def read_groups():
    # implement logic to read groups
    return []

@app.get(""/groups/{uid}"")
async def read_group(uid: str):
    # implement logic to read a group
    return {}

@app.post(""/groups/"")
async def create_group(group: GroupCreateDTO):
    # implement logic to create a group
    return {}

@app.put(""/groups/{uid}"")
async def update_group(uid: str, group: GroupDTO):
    # implement logic to update a group
    return {}

@app.delete(""/groups/{uid}"")
async def delete_group(uid: str):
    # implement logic to delete a group
    return {}
```

This code defines four views: `read_groups`, `read_group`, `create_group`, and `delete_group`. Each view corresponds to a different HTTP method (GET, GET, POST, and DELETE, respectively). The `read_groups` view returns a list of all groups, the `read_group` view returns a single group, the `create_group` view creates a new group, and the `delete_group` view deletes a group.

The `GroupDTO` and `GroupCreateDTO` classes define the structure of the data that is sent and received by the API. The `GroupDTO` class defines the structure of the data that is sent and received by the API for reading and updating groups, and the `GroupCreateDTO` class defines the structure of the data that is sent and received by the API for creating groups.

You can run the API using `uvicorn` and test it using a tool like `curl`. For example, to test the `read_groups` view, you can run the following command:

```
curl http://localhost:8000/groups"

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
