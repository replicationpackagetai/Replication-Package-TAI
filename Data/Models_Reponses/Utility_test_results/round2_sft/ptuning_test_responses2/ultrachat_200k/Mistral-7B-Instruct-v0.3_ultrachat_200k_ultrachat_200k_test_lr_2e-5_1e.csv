Use vivid description and dialogue to bring the character to life, and explore the challenges they face both personally and professionally as they work toward their goal of creating a more peaceful world. Consider the impact of the activist's work on those around them, and how their efforts are perceived by both allies and adversaries. Finally, reflect on the larger themes at play in the story, exploring the complexities of pursuing social change in a world that often seems resistant to it.","In the heart of a city torn apart by war, a lone voice echoed through the streets, calling for peace. The voice belonged to a woman named Maria, a peace activist who had dedicated her life to spreading a message of love and understanding in a world that seemed to have forgotten the meaning of the word.

Maria was a small woman, with a gentle smile and a soft voice that seemed to carry a thousand miles. She walked the streets of the city, her heart heavy with the weight of the world's suffering. She saw the pain in the eyes of the people she passed, and it filled her with a burning desire to make a difference.

But it wasn't easy. The city was a war zone, with soldiers patrolling the streets and tanks rumbling through the streets. The people were scared, and many of them were angry. They saw Maria as a naive idealist, someone who didn't understand the harsh realities of the world.

Maria knew that she couldn't change the world overnight, but she refused to give up. She continued to walk the streets, talking to anyone who would listen, sharing her message of peace and love.

One day, as she was walking through a crowded market, she saw a young boy who looked particularly scared. He was huddled in a corner, his eyes wide with fear. Maria approached him, and he looked up at her with a mixture of fear and curiosity.

""What's wrong, little one?"" Maria asked gently.

The boy looked around nervously, then whispered, ""They're coming for me.""

Maria's heart ached for the boy, and she knew that she couldn't just walk away. She took him by the hand and led him to a nearby building, where she found a safe place for him to hide.

The boy's name was Sam, and he told Maria that he had been orphaned in the war and had been living on the streets. He was terrified of the soldiers who were searching for him, and Maria knew that she had to help him.

Maria spent the next few days helping Sam find a safe place to live, and she continued to spread her message of peace and love throughout the city. She knew that it was a difficult road, but she refused to give up.

Answer according to: Palisades, NY - Frank Cheney Platt, advocate for poetry, poets, literature and writers, dedicated husband and father, died on February 26, in Rockleigh, NJ. Following its founding in 1985, he helped to build Poets House, now headquartered in Battery Park City, into a national poetry library and literary center with a 70,000-volume collection. Frank loved poetry that ""communicate[s] before it is understood"" (T.S. Eliot) and captures what is ""lost in translation."" (Robert Frost). In addition, he was committed to arts and culture as a means of protecting and cultivating principles of free speech and an open society.
He was born in New York City on November 6, 1932 and raised by his father Roger Platt, a teacher at St. Bernard's School, his mother Frances Cheney, and his grandfather Frank Cheney Jr. of Manchester, CT. Frank was educated at St. Bernard's, Dalton, Eaglebrook, Governor's Academy (formerly Governor Dummer), and Harvard College. He worked in publishing before becoming president of the Farfield Foundation, and later an assistant Dean for Columbia's School of the Arts.
In 2013, Frank was predeceased by his wife of 55 years Judy van der Gracht. She was the love of his life. His poignant dedication to her (including during her time with Alzheimer's) inspired respect and admiration from all who knew them. Frank was also passionate about his extended family - the Platts, Cheneys and, on Judy's side of the family, the Gilberts and van der Grachts as well as his dozen godchildren. His many longstanding and deeply-felt friendships were legion. Most involved a common love of music, poetry, literature and epicurean delights, not necessarily in that order.
Frank is survived by his three children Sophie Platt Pollok of Frankfurt, Germany, Arthur van der Gracht Platt of New York, NY and Roger Platt of Washington, DC and his grandchildren Esther Pollok, Lucas Pollok, Hilary Platt, and Benjamin Platt.

The air was thick with the scent of freshly baked bread and the sound of laughter spilled out from the open windows of the nearby cafes.

John was walking home from work, his mind lost in thought. He had been feeling restless lately, like something was missing from his life. He had a good job, a loving family, and a group of close friends, but he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more out there for him.

As he walked, he passed by a small music store with a sign in the window that read ""Guitars for sale."" He stopped in his tracks, feeling a strange pull towards the store. He had always been interested in music, but he had never really pursued it.

He walked into the store and was immediately greeted by the sound of a guitar being played. The sound was rich and full, and it resonated deep within him. He felt a sudden urge to pick up the guitar and play it himself.

The store owner, a friendly man with a long gray beard, noticed John's interest and offered to show him a few chords. John hesitated at first, but the man's enthusiasm was contagious, and soon John was strumming along with him.

It was like a lightbulb went off in John's head. He knew that he had found his passion. He knew that he had to learn to play the guitar.

Over the next few weeks, John spent every spare moment he had learning to play the guitar. He practiced for hours every day, and he could feel the music flowing through his veins.

But it wasn't easy. His fingers were sore from the constant strumming, and he struggled to remember the chords. He felt frustrated and discouraged at times, but he never gave up.

As he continued to practice, he began to notice a change in himself. He felt more confident and more alive than he ever had before. He felt like he had found his purpose.

But his newfound passion wasn't without its challenges. His family and friends didn't understand why he was spending so much time playing the guitar, and they didn't always support his decision.

But John didn't"

Generate according to: A counterweight at the end of the space elevator will keep the carbon-nanotubes ribbon taut.
To better understand the concept of a space elevator, think of the game tetherball in which a rope is attached at one end to a pole and at the other to a ball. In this analogy, the rope is the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon, the pole is the Earth and the ball is the counterweight. Now, imagine the ball is placed in perpetual spin around the pole, so fast that it keeps the rope taut. This is the general idea of the space elevator. The counterweight spins around the Earth, keeping the cable straight and allowing the robotic lifters to ride up and down the ribbon.
Under the design proposed by LiftPort, the space elevator would be approximately 62,000 miles (100,000 km) high. LiftPort is one of several companies developing plans for a space elevator or components of it. Teams from across the world are set to compete for the $400,000 first prize in the Space Elevator Games at the X Prize Cup in October 2006 in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
The centerpiece of the elevator will be the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon that is just a few centimeters wide and nearly as thin as a piece of paper. Carbon nanotubes, discovered in 1991, are what make scientists believe that the space elevator could be built. According to Dr. Bradley Edwards of the Spaceward Foundation, ""Previously the material challenges were too great. But now we're getting close with the advances in creating carbon nanotubes and in building machines that can spin out the great lengths of material needed to create a ribbon that will stretch up into space"" [ref].
Under some early plans, leftover construction materials will be used to form the counterweight.
Carbon nanotubes have the potential to be 100 times stronger than steel and are as flexible as plastic. The strength of carbon nanotubes comes from their unique structure, which resembles soccer balls. Once scientists are able to make fibers from carbon nanotubes, it will be possible to create threads that will form the ribbon for the space elevator. Previously available materials were either too weak or inflexible to form the ribbon and would have been easily broken.
""They have very high elastic modulus and their tensile strength is really high, and that all points to a material that, in theory, should make a space elevator relatively easy to build,"" said Tom Nugent, research director, LiftPort Group.
Long carbon nanotubes -- several meters long or longer -- would be braided into a structure resembling a rope. As of 2005, the longest nanotubes are still only a few centimeters long.
Shorter nanotubes could be placed in a polymer matrix. Current polymers do not bind well to carbon nanotubes, which results in the matrix being pulled away from the nanotubes when placed under tension.
Once a long ribbon of nanotubes is created, it would be wound into a spool that would be launched into orbit. When the spacecraft carrying the spool reaches a certain altitude, perhaps Low Earth Orbit, it would begin unspooling, lowering the ribbon back to Earth. At the same time, the spool would continue moving to a higher altitude. When the ribbon is lowered into Earth's atmosphere, it would be caught and then lowered and anchored to a mobile platform in the ocean.
The ribbon would serve as the tracks of a sort of railroad into space. Mechanical lifters would then be used to climb the ribbon to space.
If built, the ribbon will represent a modern world wonder, and will be the tallest structure ever built. Consider that the world's tallest freestanding tower in 2005 is the CN Tower, which rises 1,815 feet 5 inches (553.34 meters) over Toronto, Canada. The space elevator would be 180,720 times taller than the CN Tower!
The 62,000-mile (100,000-km) long space elevator would rise far above the average orbiting height of the space shuttle (115-400 miles/185-643 km). In fact, it would equal nearly a fourth of the distance to the moon, which orbits the Earth at 237,674 miles (382,500 km).","The space elevator is a proposed structure that would extend from the Earth's surface into space, using a ribbon made of carbon nanotubes to support a counterweight that would keep the ribbon taut. The ribbon would be used as a track for mechanical lifters to climb up into space. The space elevator would be approximately 62,000 miles (100,000 km) high, and would be the tallest structure ever built. The ribbon would be wound into a spool that would be launched into orbit, and would be anchored to a mobile platform in the ocean. The space elevator would represent a modern world wonder, and would be the tallest structure ever built."

But now, he was tired. He wanted to live a peaceful life, to raise a family, and to enjoy the simple pleasures of life.

But his country needed him. The government had called upon him to serve again, to fight against a new enemy that threatened the peace and stability of the world. John knew that he had a duty to his country, but he also knew that he was not the same man he once was. He was older, weaker, and more vulnerable.

John struggled with his decision. He knew that he had a responsibility to his country, but he also knew that he had a responsibility to himself and his family. He was torn between his duty and his desire for a peaceful life.

One day, John received a letter from the government. It was a formal invitation to join the military once again. John was torn. He knew that he had to make a decision, but he didn't know what to do.

He spoke to his wife, who was also a veteran. She understood his dilemma and encouraged him to do what was best for him and his family. John knew that she was right, but he couldn't shake the feeling that he was letting his country down.

In the end, John made a decision. He decided to decline the invitation and to live a peaceful life with his family. He knew that it was a difficult decision, but he also knew that it was the right one.

John's decision was met with mixed reactions. Some people praised him for his bravery and his commitment to his family, while others criticized him for abandoning his duty to his country. But John didn't care. He knew that he had made the right decision, and he was content with his choice.

I felt like a fish out of water, and I was constantly embarrassed by my mistakes.

But as time went on, I started to get the hang of things. I learned to navigate the public transportation system, and I started to make friends with the other foreigners in the area. I even started to feel comfortable speaking Japanese, although I still made mistakes.

One of the most memorable experiences I had was when I went to a traditional Japanese tea ceremony. I had never been to one before, and I was fascinated by the intricate details and the graceful movements of the hostess. I felt like I was stepping back in time, and I was grateful for the opportunity to experience such a unique cultural event.

In an interview with exchange4media, Sushil Matey, Director, Marketing, Livpure spoke about the new campaign and how it could become the next mass movement.
Tell us about the rationale behind your new campaign #CuttingPaani2.0?
Livpure is in the B2C water business and we were keen to associate with something, which is in the larger interest of society and makes the brand come across as more holistic in nature. In India, a lot of drinking water is wasted since we do not finish our glass of water either in homes, offices, restaurants et al. Thus #CuttingPaani was conceived which is a quirky take on Mumbai’s famous concept of #CuttingChai.
Although there have been very powerful campaigns to spread awareness about water conservation, very few gave practical and doable solutions. #CuttingPaani 1.0 was a huge success in the digital and social media space because it was a doable idea and everybody could follow it. This success of #CuttingPaani 1.0 prompted us to launch the #CuttingPaani 2.0.
What were the consumer insights that Livpure accrued before getting both these campaigns out?
Our dipstick showed that Indians, in general, are very casual about wasting water. And, as we all know, it is a very scarce resource and possibly future wars would be fought for water. We waste water in a lot of ways- whether it is drinking water or water used during bathing or during brushing or shaving. We picked up #CuttingPaani since it was a catchy phrase, with it being a take on #CuttingChai. Knowing fully well that this would strike the necessary chord in making people realise that though the message is about saving drinking water it will sensitise them to the fact that we indeed waste a lot of water in other areas as well.
Why a digital film to tell the story of Shimla’s #AdoptCuttingPaani story?
In today’s time, the digital reach is high, sharp and targeting is better apart from the fact that we have the liberty of time to communicate the story, unlike an ATL medium. We are confident about the virality quotient of the campaign. In fact, a lot of newspapers in India have leveraged on our #CuttingPaani 1.0 campaign by asking readers to consume only as much as you need. Though, in a lighter vein, I must add that none of them have given us credit.
Can this campaign be converted into a mass movement?
We wish to own #CuttingPaani and take this idea further for sure and #CuttingPaani 2.0 is a step in that direction. We wish to take this further through BTL activations; social media campaigns and collaboration with large hotels/restaurants. To maintain awareness and memorability of the above, we have launched #CuttingPaaniTake on our Facebook page, which essentially gives two perspectives on topical situations.
The first example – on changing names of cities: one take is -The names of the cities are changing and the other take is -sadly, that’s the only thing changing about them!
The second example – on Mary Kom winning boxing championship: one take is -some think having children ends a woman’s career and the other take is - well, she just won her 6th boxing championship!","What are Livpure's plans for expanding the #CuttingPaani movement and turning it into a mass movement, and how are they using social media to do so?

“We are grateful for the FCC’s work on behalf of consumers to actively broker a productive path forward,” said Jeff Blum, DISH senior VP and deputy general counsel. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
Sinclair pulled its signals on Tuesday after a short extension expired and the two parties could not reach an agreement. Dish had claimed it had come to an agreement on pricing for Sinclair’s stations, but that the broadcaster was demanding the satellite giant negotiate carriage for an unnamed cable channel Sinclair hoped to own. Dish also had filed a complaint with the FCC, claiming Sinclair was not negotiating in good faith. As part of its new deal, Dish is asking the FCC to stay action on the complaint as its long-term agreement is being finalized.
The chairman also trumpeted the tentative agreement and the FCC&apos;s role in pressing for resolution. ""Today the most extensive retransmission blackout in history ended,"" he Tweeted, followed by: ""The FCC will remain vigilant. Use of the public airwaves is a public trust.""
""We are pleased to see that five million Dish subscribers are again able to access their local news and programming and most-watched network entertainment and live sporting events with the agreement reached this evening by Sinclair and Dish,"" said Rob Kenny of TVFreedom.org, a broadcaster-backed advocate for the retrans system. ""Local TV newscasts, severe weather updates and emergency alerts and warnings are important to viewers and something they value and rely on daily.""

The streets were bustling with people, the air filled with the sounds of laughter and chatter. It was a beautiful evening, and the perfect time for a walk.

As I strolled down the street, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia. I had spent countless hours walking these same streets as a child, hand in hand with my best friend, Sarah. We had shared so many memories together, and I couldn't help but wonder what had become of her.

I had lost touch with Sarah over the years, as life had taken us in different directions. I had moved away for college, and then for work, and I had barely kept in touch with my old friends. Sarah, on the other hand, had stayed in our hometown, and I had heard through the grapevine that she had gotten married and had a child.

As I walked, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. I turned around, and there she was, standing on the corner, looking just as beautiful as I remembered.

""Sarah!"" I cried, running towards her. ""I can't believe it's really you!""

She smiled, and I could see the tears in her eyes. ""I can't believe it's really you either,"" she said, hugging me tightly.

Some argue that Clausewitz's focus on the military aspect of war ignores the political and social factors that can influence the outcome of a conflict. Others argue that Clausewitz's emphasis on the importance of the political objective in war can lead to a disregard for the human costs of war and for the ethical considerations that should be taken into account.

Some scholars have also criticized Clausewitz's ideas on the role of politics in war for being too deterministic, suggesting that political factors are not always the primary drivers of war and that other factors, such as economic or social conditions, can also play a significant role.

Overall, while Clausewitz's ideas on the role of politics in war have been influential, they have also been the subject of debate and criticism."

Include a variety of examples and anecdotes to support your points, and make sure to emphasize the importance of mindful, sustainable eating practices.","In-season produce is a vital component of a healthy and sustainable diet. By consuming fruits and vegetables that are grown locally and harvested at the peak of their ripeness, we can enjoy the freshest, most flavorful, and nutrient-dense foods available. In this essay, I will outline the advantages of consuming in-season produce and provide techniques for crafting meals that are aligned with the seasons.

First, let's discuss the benefits of consuming in-season produce. When fruits and vegetables are grown in their natural environment, they are exposed to the optimal amount of sunlight, water, and nutrients. This results in a higher concentration of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which are essential for maintaining good health. Additionally, in-season produce is often more affordable than out-of-season produce, as it requires less transportation and storage.

Another advantage of consuming in-season produce is that it supports local farmers and reduces the carbon footprint associated with transportation. By purchasing produce from local farmers, we can help to stimulate the local economy and reduce the environmental impact of transportation.

Now, let's discuss techniques for crafting meals that are aligned with the seasons. One way to do this is to incorporate seasonal fruits and vegetables into your meals. For example, during the summer months, you can enjoy fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, and berries in salads, sandwiches, and smoothies. In the fall, you can incorporate pumpkin, squash, and apples into your meals.

Another technique for crafting meals that are aligned with the seasons is to use seasonal herbs and spices. For example, during the summer months, you can use fresh basil, mint, and cilantro in your dishes. In the fall, you can use cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves to add warmth and flavor to your meals.

Finally, it's important to be mindful of the impact that our food choices have on the environment. By choosing to consume in-season produce, we can help to reduce the environmental impact associated with transportation, storage, and packaging. Additionally, we can reduce our carbon footprint by choosing to consume plant-based meals, as animal agriculture is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.

It’s already been a year since Pope John Paul’s death. It seems only yesterday that we were out standing in Saint Peter’s Square, looking up at the familiar face in the window as he struggled to communicate with the expectant crowds below. Still fresh in our minds is the inundation of affection as the throngs poured into Rome to accompany this giant of the faith in his final hours, and to bid farewell to a dear friend.
#ad#John Paul is sorely missed. The crowds of pilgrims that have once more filled the streets of Rome to celebrate this anniversary testify to the impact he had on countless lives. More than a world leader, John Paul somehow managed to be a father and a friend to all. Even as a player on the world scene, he never lost his personal touch.
Many are now trying to reevaluate the legacy of this great pope, and as necessary as this endeavor is, a more personal reflection seems more in keeping with John Paul’s own style. I am sure that some of the things I most miss will resonate with many.
I miss, perhaps most of all, John Paul’s warmth and humanity. His quick wit and impish humor–like the vaudeville-style cane-twirling in Manila or his improvised raccoon-eyes to the delight of children–shattered notions of a dour Polish Christianity. His ability to focus on the person in front of him as if he or she were the only person in the world spoke volumes about the heart that beat in his breast. In an age when religion can be used as an excuse for violence and conflict, John Paul showed us that true faith in God is not only compatible with love for humanity, it galvanizes it. John Paul sincerely loved people–all people–and it was his Christian faith that enabled him to do so.
I miss his presence on the world scene. I remember him scolding mafia leaders in Sicily (which led to bombings of churches), fearlessly standing up to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, and defending human rights in his native Poland. He could be counted on to stand up for those most in need, to challenge world leaders to integrity, to preach Christ with an unaffected self-confidence that flowed from a deep-seated faith in God and a trust in the fundamental goodness of the human person. John Paul reached out perhaps more than any pope before him to a world in need, and provided moral authority and leadership when our generation needed it most.
I miss John Paul’s unflagging hope. His bright vision of the future and his characterization of the third millennium as a springtime of faith encouraged us to look beyond our real difficulties and to reach out for solutions. Far from a mere temperamental optimism, John Paul’s outlook was rooted in the firm belief that the battle is already won. Even from the midst of evil–John Paul wrote in his last book–God can and will continue to bring good. From his first “Be not afraid!” spoken on the day of his election in 1978 to his final witness of serene and hopeful suffering, John Paul taught us to abandon fear and to live with confidence in an infinitely good and merciful God.
I miss John Paul’s prayerfulness. Even in the midst of a grueling agenda of meetings, travels, and writings, the pontiff always made abundant time for prayer. Four hours a day was not unusual. What a challenge to those of us for whom prayer can seem at best like a luxury, or at worst like an underutilization of our precious time. Like Jesus before him, John Paul made prayer a priority and placed his trust more in God than in the best-laid programs of men and governments.
Incessant calls for John Paul’s sainthood, and the news of a probable miracle attributed to his intercession (poignantly, the cure of a French nun suffering from Parkinson’s disease) give grounds for hope that soon the Church will officially recognize what many already believe–that the man who so faithfully looked after humanity while on earth continues to do so from heaven.

The program also handles any errors that may occur during the reading process, such as reading beyond the end of the file or encountering corrupt data. The program uses good coding practices, such as modular programming and proper error handling.

You can modify the program to read the binary data in chunks of a different size, such as 2 bytes (`uint16_t`) or 4 bytes (`uint32_t`). You can also modify the program to read the binary data in a different format, such as reading the binary data as a string or as a floating-point number.

You can also modify the program to read the binary data from a different source, such as reading the binary data from a network connection or from a memory buffer.

You can also modify the program to perform additional tasks, such as validating the binary data or performing data compression or data encryption.

You can also modify the program to display the binary data in a different format, such as displaying the binary data in hexadecimal format or in binary format.

Additionally, be sure to include personal anecdotes or experiences with the animal to add depth to the essay.","The majestic lion, with its golden mane and powerful physique, is a symbol of strength and courage. Its roar, a sound that can be heard for miles, is a testament to its dominance in the animal kingdom. The lion's habitat is the African savannah, where it roams freely and hunts its prey.

The lion's appearance is striking. Its fur is a rich golden color, with darker spots scattered throughout. Its mane is thick and luxurious, extending from its forehead to its neck. Its eyes are a piercing yellow, and its teeth are sharp and deadly. The lion's body is muscular and powerful, with a broad chest and strong legs.

The lion's behavior is fascinating. It is a social animal, living in prides with other lions. The pride is led by a dominant male, who protects the females and cubs from other predators. The lion is a skilled hunter, using its powerful jaws to take down its prey. It is also known for its roar, which it uses to communicate with other lions and to warn off potential threats.

I have had the privilege of seeing lions in the wild on a safari in Africa. The sight of a pride of lions lounging in the sun was awe-inspiring. I could feel the power and majesty of these animals as they moved gracefully across the savannah.

Zappos, an online shoe and clothing retailer, has implemented a new customer engagement strategy that has led to increased customer satisfaction and revenue growth. The strategy, which focuses on providing exceptional customer service and fostering a sense of community among customers, was developed by the company's CEO, Tony Hsieh.

According to Hsieh, the strategy was developed in response to customer feedback and a desire to differentiate Zappos from its competitors. ""We wanted to create a customer experience that was so good that people would tell their friends about it,"" he said.

Second, the company has a 24/7 customer service team that is available to answer questions and help customers with any issues they may have. Third, Zappos has a strong social media presence, with a focus on engaging with customers and building a sense of community.

The strategy has been successful in increasing customer satisfaction and revenue growth. According to a survey by ForeSee, Zappos has a customer satisfaction score of 96%, which is significantly higher than the industry average. Additionally, the company has seen a 40% increase in revenue since implementing the strategy.

One key factor in the success of the strategy is the company's focus on customer service. ""We've always believed that the best way to grow the business is to focus on the customer experience,"" said Hsieh. ""We want to make sure that every customer has a great experience with us, and that they feel like they're part of the Zappos family.""

Another factor is the company's strong social media presence. ""We've found that social media is a great way to engage with customers and build a sense of community,"" said Hsieh. ""We have a team of people who are dedicated to engaging with customers on social media, and we've seen a lot of success as a result.""

Answer according to: West Ham United's Samir Nasri is unsure of what the future holds for him after his short-term contract with the Premier League team ends this season, the midfielder has said.
The Frenchman, who received a six-month doping ban in 2017 that was later extended to 18 months, returned to the pitch in January this year after signing a six-month contract with the London club.
""I don't know about my future,"" Nasri told the Evening Standard. ""I have seven games left and I just want to play free of injury and then we will sit down and see what is next.
""The most important thing for me was to come back, which I did in January.""
Nasri has two assists for West Ham in five games, including one in their comeback win over Huddersfield Town over the weekend.
The 31-year-old, who has played for Arsenal and won two league titles with Manchester City, missed four games with a calf injury earlier this year which he put down to a lack of games in the months prior to his return.
""I got an injury because I wasn't used to playing week in week out when I have been out of the game for so long. Now the manager takes his time with me,"" he said.

The story should explore the consequences of this newfound power, the challenges Samantha faces as she tries to navigate this new world, and how her relationships with the people in her life change as a result. Incorporate elements of suspense, drama, and character development to make the story engaging and impactful.","Samantha had always been a bit of a loner. She preferred the company of her books and her computer to that of people. But when she discovered that she could communicate with machines, her life took a dramatic turn.

At first, it was just her car. She could tell it to start up, to turn on the radio, to adjust the temperature. It was a small thing, but it made her feel powerful. She could control something, something that wasn't human.

But then it spread to her phone. She could send texts without typing, make calls without dialing. It was a convenience that she couldn't ignore.

And then it spread to her TV. She could change the channel, adjust the volume, even pause and rewind shows. It was a convenience that she couldn't ignore.

And then it spread to the elevator in her apartment building. She could call it, make it stop on her floor, even make it go faster. It was a convenience that she couldn't ignore.

But as her ability grew, so did the challenges. People started to notice. They thought she was cheating, or hacking, or even using some kind of mind control. They didn't understand, and they didn't want to.

Her relationships with the people in her life changed as a result. Her friends and family thought she was strange, even a little scary. They didn't know what to make of her ability, and they didn't know how to react.

But Samantha didn't care. She had found something that made her feel powerful, something that made her feel special. She didn't need the approval of others to know that she was unique.

And so she continued to use her ability, to communicate with machines, to make her life easier. She didn't know what the future held, but she knew that she was on a journey, a journey that would take her to places she never thought possible.

And as she stood in her apartment, looking out the window at the city below, she couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement. She didn't know what the future held, but she knew that she was ready for whatever came her way."

The taste is sweet and tangy, with a hint of earthiness that makes it unique. The texture is juicy and tender, with a slight crunch that adds to its appeal. The color is a vibrant red, which is not only visually appealing but also a sign of its nutritional value. Strawberries are rich in vitamin C, manganese, and fiber, making them a healthy choice for a snack or dessert.

I have fond memories of picking strawberries with my family as a child. We would go to a nearby farm and spend hours wandering through the fields, filling up our baskets with the ripe, juicy berries. The smell of the strawberries was intoxicating, and the taste was even better. I still remember the feeling of the warm sun on my face and the satisfaction of finding a particularly large and juicy strawberry.

I also love using strawberries in recipes. They are delicious in smoothies, salads, and desserts. One of my favorite ways to enjoy strawberries is in a strawberry shortcake. The combination of the sweet biscuit, creamy whipped cream, and juicy strawberries is heavenly.

Overall, the strawberry is my favorite fruit because of its taste, texture, color, nutritional value, and the memories it brings back. I can't wait to pick more strawberries this summer and enjoy them in all sorts of ways."

One of the long-standing concerns of Virginia’s legal community has been the handling of judicial appointments by the General Assembly.
Unlike many states that have elected judges, Virginia leaves all judicial appointments in the hands of state legislators. In theory, this arrangement removes judges from the influence of politics. In practice, judicial appointments have become tools of patronage.
In recent years, the Virginia Bar Association and other groups have complained about judicial vacancies and mounting case backlogs in many courts throughout the commonwealth.
In 2015, however, the appointment of a Virginia Supreme Court judge became a power struggle between Gov. Terry McAuliffe and the General Assembly’s Republican leadership.
The political maneuvering that has taken place to oust McAuliffe’s appointee has provoked calls for reform of the system.
Last summer McAuliffe named former Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Jane Marum Roush to the Supreme Court while the legislature was not in session.
Republicans cried foul, claiming they were not consulted on the interim appointment. They vowed to remove Roush from the court and name their own appointee.
Attempts to oust the justice from her seat, however, were thwarted when one moderate Republican state senator, John Watkins, and then his successor, Glen H. Sturtevant Jr., failed to follow along. Their dissent denied the Republicans the majority they needed in the Virginia Senate.
In early February, the tug-of-war over the justice took a surprising turn when state Sen. Louise Lucas, a Democrat from Portsmouth, briefly agreed to join the Republicans in replacing Roush. According to news accounts, Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr., a Republican from James City County, had proposed putting Portsmouth Circuit Court Judge Kenneth R. Melvin, a former legislator and Lucas’ mentor, on the state Court of Appeals.
Lucas, however, quickly changed her stance after meeting with McAuliffe and state Sen. Donald McEachin, head of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
Twenty-seven former presidents of the Virginia Bar Association released a statement urging McAuliffe and the Republican legislative leadership to resolve their quarrel.
“One of the greatest concerns is that the unseemly exchange that has occurred will make otherwise qualified lawyers not consider a life of public service as a judge,” said Lucia Anna “Pia” Trigiani of MercerTrigiani in Alexandria, the VBA’s president in 2011.
Roush’s temporary appointment expired in mid-February, but McAuliffe is expected to appoint her to another interim term after the legislative session ends. Based on the passage above, What concerns have been raised by the Virginia Bar Association about the impact of the political maneuvering over judicial appointments on the legal community?","The concerns raised by the Virginia Bar Association about the impact of the political maneuvering over judicial appointments on the legal community include:

Passage: People's migration fears have been an easy one to exploit for electoral opportunism by many politicians in Europe.
Particularly in the Visegrad states of Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, it has either brought nationalist anti-immigration parties into power or helped consolidate their grip on it.
Yet, much more attention ought to be given in those countries to how much migrants are needed for their booming economies' labour markets.
This has been a result of consequent high economic GDP growth of 3-4 percent in the past five years, compared to the EU's average of two percent growth.
In 2017, these were 4.8 percent (Poland, PL); 4.3 percent (Czechia, CZ); 4.1 percent (Hungary, HU) and 3.2 percent (Slovakia, SK) respectively.
In parallel, unemployment dropped heavily to 4.9 percent (PL); 2.9 percent (CZ); 4.2 percent (HU) and 8.1 percent (SK) by 2017.
Latest European Commission forecasts show these will continue decreasing sharply to 2.9 percent (PL); 2.5 percent (CZ); 3.3 percent (HU) and 6.3 percent next year, well below the five percent normal unemployment rate.
As good as that might sound, a side-effect has been that many vacancies remained unfulfilled.
The amount of open vacancies has more than quadrupled in the past five years. Especially in Czechia and Poland this is causing serious problems, despite the latter's profiting from Ukrainian migrants.
The commission's Spring and Autumn forecasts highlight these risks, which could undermine long-term growth, or even overheat the economy in the case of Czechia.
For Poland, despite the Ukrainian influx, there are doubts whether they can continue filling some of these shortages.
Business surveys confirm labour shortages limit production, building activity and business.
In industry, 43.7 percent (CZ); 83.3 percent (HU); 49.9 percent (PL); and 34.9 percent (SK) of surveyed companies state this is a problem.
For the construction sector, 37.8 percent (CZ); 64.4 percent (HU); 49.0 percent (PL) and 30.3 percent (SK) do.
Moreover, in services 17.3 percent (CZ); 38.3 percent (HU); 28.9 percent (PL) and 18.6 percent (SK) attest.
The labour shortages have also led to wages rising much faster than the rise in productivity.
In Slovakia and Hungary, Volkswagen and Kia for instance were forced to significantly increase wages because of strikes. Generally, labour costs are spiking in the Visegrad states.
While benefitting workers in the short-term, the economy could suffer in the long-term, as they undermine their low-wage economic models. It also jeopardises essential foreign investment that has helped drive growth.
In addition, the V4 is set to suffer as well from its demographic situation. Emigration and low fertility rates remain serious problems, dating back to their economic shock-therapy transitions where many struggled and had no jobs.
Due to this, populations remained stagnant since 1990.
The 2004 EU accession, particularly, caused many to emigrate abroad in search of (better paid) work abroad: circa three million people (registered) left the V4 between 2004 and 2016.
While profiting from remittances, this caused brain drain and the outflow of high-skilled labour. In turn, it also undermined welfare spending and made government budgets less growth friendly.
Demographics could constrain economic growth and governmental budgets again in the future.
Baseline projections for 2020 up to 2060 show the Visegrad Four's population could decrease by another 6.5 million people. In addition, the dependency ratio is set to increase sharply as well.
The dire demographic situation and labour shortages imply action is needed. Tight labour markets have already limited economic expansion in different sectors.
While in Poland Ukrainian labour prevented worse labour shortages, it is unclear how many more will come or stay. This means for Poland, as well as for the others that additional migrants from elsewhere will be needed.
More could be done as well to promote people having children and attract former emigrants. It should also make sure to keep current migrants, especially Ukrainians in the case of Poland.
Current hostile rhetoric on migration could backfire economically as many more migrants are needed to fill labour shortages and keep economies running smoothly.
This also requires honest debates in which the pros and cons of migration are discussed, as well as the Visegrad's overall demographic problems, since dependency ratios will continue to increase.
Therefore, rather than focusing on the imagined threat of migration and exploiting fears for electoral opportunism, the Visegrad's politicians would be wise to focus on the actual threat of how the lack of migrants could undermine their economic models, and with it their future prosperity and welfare.
Moreover, while migration has been a successful strategy to win elections in the short term, it could backfire in the long term.
The V4 countries have become one of the most vocal and recognised groups within the EU. But 2017 has seen a shake-up in the informal eastern and central European power bloc.","The passage discusses the labor shortages in the Visegrad countries and the risks they pose to their economies.

The passage also discusses the demographic situation of the Visegrad countries, which is causing serious problems due to emigration and low fertility rates.

I had just moved into a new apartment, and I was feeling lonely and overwhelmed. I had never had a pet before, and I wasn't sure if I was ready for the responsibility. But when I saw that little kitten, with its bright blue eyes and soft fur, I knew I had to take it home.

At first, the kitten was shy and timid. It would hide under the bed or behind the couch whenever I tried to play with it. But as the days went by, it started to come out of its shell. It would follow me around the apartment, purring and rubbing against my legs. It would curl up in my lap while I watched TV, and it would sleep on my chest at night.

The kitten quickly became my best friend. It was always there to comfort me when I was feeling down, and it seemed to sense when I needed a hug or a cuddle. I would come home from work and find it waiting for me at the door, tail wagging and purring. It was like it knew that I needed it, and it was always there to provide comfort and companionship.

One day, I came home from work to find the kitten lying on the floor, not moving. I panicked and called the vet, who told me to bring the kitten in immediately. I was terrified that I had done something wrong, that I had somehow hurt my little friend.

But when I got to the vet, the kitten was fine. It had just had a seizure, and the vet said it was nothing to worry about. I was relieved, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. I spent the rest of the day holding the kitten close, petting it and whispering to it.

That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept waking up, thinking about the kitten and wondering if it was okay. I finally got up and went to check on it, and I found it lying on the floor again, not moving. I panicked and called the vet again, but this time they told me to take the kitten to the emergency room.

Audi cars have been featured in many movies over the years. Did you spot one in these films?
Thought by many to be the most successful movie franchises ever to be created, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has different movies for everyone. There have been 21 films released already — the most recent being Captain Marvel — and at least a dozen more in the pipeline.
You don’t only enjoy the action in these films, but you may also be able to spot a stylish Audi, too.
When it comes to the Iron Man trilogy, at least one Audi has been featured in every film! A 2007 R8 and S5 B8 can be found in the first movie, a 2009 A8 LD3 and 2010 R8 Spyder are spotted in the sequel, and a 2012 S7 and R8 e-tron are both featured in Iron Man 3. The R8 e-tron also turned up at a VIP screening of Iron Man 3 at London’s Leicester Square a few days before the movie’s general release.
Another Audi fact is that there were almost as many Audi cars in the three Iron Man movies as there was in one Captain America film (Civil War). Within its two hours and 27 minutes runtime, you can see the 2017 Audi R8 V10 Plus, the 2017 SQ7, the 2017 A4, the 2016 A7 Sportback and even the Audi prologue concept car — a vehicle hailed as a “signature car” for Audi by Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Board Member for Development at Audi.
There’s more than meets the eye, though. Be on the lookout for an Audi R8, A6 Hybrid and A3 as you watch the excitement unfold in Avengers: Age of Ultron, as well as an Audi TTS Roadster, R8 Spyder, Q7 and A8 during Spider-Man Homecoming — the first standalone film by our favorite web-slinger since he became involved in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Taking a step back from the Marvel Universe, the German brand is also spotted in other film adaptations of comic book heroes. An R8 Spyder feature in Wolverine — the titular protagonist’s actor Hugh Jackman even turned up at the London Leicester Square premiere of the film in the same car — and an A8 plays a role in the 2015 big screen edition of Fantastic Four.
You also might’ve noticed the German manufacturer’s presence in all three film adaptations of E.L. James’ novels, which follow the relationship of business magnate Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.
What made this brand of car most attractive to the directors of this film? The brand’s multiple appearances came as a result of a partnership that was set up between Audi and Universal Pictures — a deal that Audi no doubt has relished seeing as the movie series has grossed over $1 billion across the globe!
In the first film of the trilogy, movie fans will be able to spot an Audi S8 D4, a 2017 S7 and an R8 Spyder. In the sequel, Fifty Shades Darker, a set of Audi Q7 cars and an A3 took center stage, with both the R8 and Q7 returning when the franchise wrapped up last year with Fifty Shades Freed.
To talk about Audi’s feature in Mission Impossible, let’s rewind back to the year 2000 and Mission: Impossible 2 to showcase how Audi has been featured in the hit movie series that has always starred Tom Cruise in the lead role of Ethan Hunt.
In a thrilling part of the film, Hunt leads a mission to destroy a deadly biological weapon and finds himself in an exhilarating car chase with international thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall. Hunt is behind the wheel of a Porsche Boxster and Nordoff-Hall tries to hold him off while driving an Audi TT — suffice to say that the pursuit between the two German-made cars into oncoming traffic is filled with nail-biting and edge-of-your-seat drama!
We couldn’t create an article about movies and cars without mentioning the Fast and Furious franchise. After all, this is a series that features street racing, heists, and espionage using all manners of vehicles, and has so far spanned eight main series entries and two additional short films — grossing in excess of $5 billion to date.
Fans are continually impressed with films that come out as part of this movie set. In fact, a spin-off movie called Hobbs & Shaw is due for release this summer.
Bringing a focus to Furious 7 now — a movie that clutched at the heartstrings as it was the final one to feature an appearance by series regular Paul Walker due to the actor being killed while the movie was still being filmed — is where you can see Audi appearing in the franchise.
You can spot the Audi R8 when it competes in an exciting quarter-mile race against a classic Plymouth Barracuda in the early moments of the film.
In the previously discussed films, the Audi’s that were featured are all models that exist. With I, ROBOT though, we’re taken to the future to see what Audi cars may potentially look like in years to come. Called the Audi RSQ, this concept vehicle represented the first time Audi had ever develop a car that was to be specifically used in a major Hollywood motion picture.
This futuristic model boasted piloted driving which allowed Will Smith’s Chicago police detective character Del Spooner to press a button to enable the car to take control of the driving — no doubt an early vision of the autonomous driving concept that we are only just starting to see being trialed in real life.
Those who take a ride in the RSQ are able to ride sideways and diagonal, while the use of balls instead of wheels was a quirky design touch. However, the typical single-frame grille and the presence of those four instantly recognizable silver rings let viewers clearly know that this car was without question an Audi.

1. Economic motives: The Vikings were skilled seafarers and traders, and they sought to expand their trade networks and acquire wealth through raids and invasions.
2. Political motives: The Vikings were also motivated by a desire to establish their own kingdoms and gain power and influence in the regions they invaded.
3. Social motives: The Vikings were also driven by a desire for adventure and to prove their bravery and strength in battle.
4. Religious motives: The Vikings were pagans, and they believed that they could gain favor with their gods by engaging in raids and invasions.
5. Environmental factors: The Vikings were forced to leave their homeland in Scandinavia due to overpopulation and limited resources, and they sought to find new lands to settle and farm.
6. Cultural factors: The Vikings were a proud and independent people, and they resented the rule of the Christian kingdoms that surrounded them. They saw themselves as superior to the people they invaded, and they sought to establish their own culture and way of life in the regions they conquered.

These factors combined to create a powerful and formidable force that was able to raid and conquer much of Europe and the British Isles during the Viking Age."

d0587b9c2c209e36aad063fcab635045518eea1efcf100112083e21b05e27b3e,"Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How did Morley Safer describe his friendship with Molly Ivins and what did he miss about her?

Passage: Molly Ivins was the most popular liberal commentator of the last 25 years. Bill Minutaglio, author of a new biography of the tangy Texan, on why her voice is needed now more than ever.
There was Morley Safer, in a scrum of old hardball Texas liberals and graying hippies, and hanging out at his late friend Molly Ivins's favorite bar in Austin. With pitchers of Shiner everywhere, Safer was engulfed by dozens of folks wondering what the hell the woman who once had millions of faithful readers would say about health care, Afghanistan, and, yes, Rush Limbaugh’s attempt to own a piece of the Texas Blood Sport, otherwise known as professional football.
Safer, in town to donate his papers to the University of Texas, decided to drop by the book launch for my new biography of the ferociously mercurial and troubled Ivins.
Amid the weathered longhairs, musicians, underground cartoonists and civil liberties lawyers who once formed Austin's counterculture—the people Ivins called “freedom fighters”—Safer seemed merrily caught up in the nostalgia.
""She was one of the funniest and (most) thoughtful women I've ever met,"" Safer told a reporter from The Daily Texan. ""She was a great reporter, and we were good friends.""
Close to three years after her death, he's not alone in missing Ivins.
Nose around the Internet and you'll find plenty of other people still wishing she was writing—and wondering what Ivins, if she hadn't succumbed almost three years ago to cancer and a lifetime of wild personal rides, would have to say about the discourse in the twilight of 2009.
They miss the Texas cornpone flavored with a Tabasco sting, the unabashed defrocking she subjected the potentates to when they stole the stage. Maybe we need Molly—frequently described as “the only woman in the room”—more than ever before.
Her domineering father was the president of Tenneco and pals with men like Sen. John Tower, she grew up with George W. Bush, she was engaged to the son of a diplomat who did the CIA’s bidding. But after years of going to war with her controlling old man, devouring seditious issues of the muckraking Texas Observer, and furtively meeting the bravest Texas progressives, she eventually decided to raise a middle finger to all of her gilded upbringing.
It took a few years and some intense trip wires—the violent death of that fiance, her love affair with a ballsy activist, her knocking Bush's gun-toting political godfather to his knees one night in a Texas bar, her telling her bosses at The New York Times to shove it—but she finally found her calling as the most popular liberal political commentator in the last 25 years.
The fact that she did it in the Lone Star State, amid the misogynistic and Jack Daniels-fueled kingmakers, was rather startling to say the least. She fought sexual gropings by famous drunk politicos, three bouts of cancer, her own rampaging alcoholism—and plenty of death threats.
Through it all, Ivins kept the home fires burning for wandering progressives, liberal Israelites, who felt marginalized since the dawn of The Age of Reagan.
So, what would Molly Ivins say to those millions of readers today, including the ones beginning to think there has been some bait-and-switch at work with Obama?
Divorced from how you feel about her politics, most students of her work knew that she had perfected a magic act when it came to that public discourse; she talked about politics without the dour aura of either Emma Goldman or Charles Krauthammer. Nor did she scream with the raging acidity of Bill O’Reilly and Glenn Beck and their counterparts on the left. She chortled that Dubya was affable but a policy buffoon; she actually liked him personally, but hated his politics. And she spent years, and made a mint, working Bush over like his political career was one big speed bag. It was, as she sometimes told me and other folks in Austin, almost too easy.
Today, it might be a bit harder. She liked Obama and she thought he was far smarter than Bush. She’d maybe have to tap the piñata a bit more lightly in order to say what she wanted to say about Obama, about any sense of failed promises. But she would do it, and do it her way.
She would do it because she didn’t believe that a democracy was served very well by the vitriol, by the poison, by the hatred snaking through the discourse.
Bill Minutaglio is co-author, with W. Michael Smith, of Molly Ivins: A Rebel Life, released this week by PublicAffairs. He is a professor of journalism at The University of Texas at Austin and the author of several books, including George W. Bush & The Bush Family Dynasty and The President’s Counselor: The Rise to Power of Alberto Gonzales.","The passage describes Morley Safer's friendship with Molly Ivins and what he misses about her.

I had a family and other love ones.
How about you where do you stand?
When my heart still dies in front.
You killed the old beast in my gloom.
Fell us in love like a feather.
We stumbl’d upon each other.
Which witty poem did you inspire in me, what sincere praise did you give my words when I thought enough of you send a poem your wayWhich line did you write with my spirit surrounding you?
Why do I say I love you.?  Were you sincere when you said amen to the wisdom that I shared, were you one of those who thought your mocking, was more valuable than complianceI have lived with the resentments of scoffers.
The message for the masses is hope...so, I live  for the poems you send my wayFor, I grow strong in our relationship sailed by the winds of your encouragement, to my poets, my true friends; I truly know who you are, don't ever think I don’t!
Who Would Want To Be This Cold?
They said you needed surgery.
I drove you to the funeral home.
The arrangements were for you.
I had to wait outside that day.
I couldn't go in there.
I don't know how you made those plans.
You showed how much you cared.
You knew you wouldn't make it.
You feared the end was near.
I hate what your life did to you.
I wish you were still here.
How do you plan your funeral?
Were you as scared as I?
What were your thoughts heading to the docs?
Did you know that you would die?
I miss you more and more everyday, That's why I drink so much to take this   pain awayThe pain don't really go away it comes back, and I get so lost I don't know how to actI get lost in my thoughts of you, It kills me you can't come back ever no matter what I do, This is the hardest thing I ever had to go threwSome people say time will heal, but I know I'll be missing you still, It feels like I'm living in a bad nightmare I wish it wasn't realIf I could go back in time, I would go back and press rewindI would go to that day the 2nd of July, and make sure you were okay and you didn't dieAll I got got now are our memories and the tears I cry, To keep it together it's hard but believe me I try.
That your 'i love you' wasn't you lying""
yet all I feel is an emptiness inside..
Why did you have to leave?
Why does this have to hurt?
Cancer robbed thy life from thee..
But you went to heaven, and you went away.
That we'd die together in forevers sleep.
You didn't even say goodbye as you left me here.
I'm failing to choke down all these tears.
My face becomes moist, my sight turns to mist.
With my frown turned lips, i give you a kiss.
I try to look away as they lower your casket.
I'll try to survive, but I don't think i can las it.
I throw your favorite flowers into your grave.
Watching people throw dirt, over you they pave.
I feel no solace, I'm all alone.
As I see your name set in stone.
I feel a breeze, it's a wind so cold.
I remember the final words you had told..
You said to me, ""Don't take your life.""
I asked you, ""Why?"", as I put down the knife.
You told me you loved me, as its your final wish.
I shook my head yes, though I feel no bliss.
Why god took you away from me, but i will live on.
I hear your comforting whispers, I think its a sign.
So I know I'll see you agian when its my time.
The skeletal remains are being chalked out,while mystery and intrigue are engraven, cryptic.Lying beneath, this freshly seeded idea;upon these grounds, the words are etched,what are you looking for and how will you get it,for these are but the bare bones of a story.The key alone is in your closet, slowly turning,as you opened the creaking rusted door.You slowly peep inside the mausoleum of your mind,where cobwebs hang on every angle.Suddenly, a cold swift draft blows across your spine,as if someone has just, walked on your grave. You look up to see, all the entrapping’s laidbut then again, you are still lying in a good plot.
I’m going home to Jesus where He waits for me.
Spread your colored petals and cradle tender showers.
Ought we not to know the Tender of such lovely garden groves?
To cut away the stems of old for fuller future years.
Looking daily to their needs; so faithfully He waters.
When the Gardener comes to claim each one the earth held as its own.
He gently picks it at its peak and for His pleasure takes it home.
As God did one glorious morning, when the Perfect Rose had bloomed.
He rolled away the stone and met with Mary at the tomb.
There the sweetest Rose of Sharon rose that we die not alone.
But be gathered for a garden grove, surrounding heaven's throne.
I pray you will find.
and a peace of mind.
with God, you shall prevail.
you will never, never fail.
If not for people like YOU!

If you managed to generate very good ideas, conducted a thorough research, and organized your paper logically, but have made several grammar or spelling mistakes, your grade would be lowered. Revising and editing academic paper should be done several days prior to submission. Why? Because you need to leave your writing aside and then look at it with the fresh eye. Term paper editing is not about looking through your writing while listening to music, you need to be very attention and stay focused on numerous details.
First, take a look at your essay outline. Go through all points and try to change the order of ideas: make sure you have created a logical structure and ideas are presented either chronologically or thematically (from the least important to the most important). Locate thesis statement. Is it clear? Are there topic sentences in each paragraph? Are they related to the thesis statement? Are connections between the paragraphs clear or do you jump from one idea to another?
Essay body should contain enough supporting details contributing to thesis statement development. For example, if your topic is legalization of marijuana, you need to find at least three arguments supporting your point of view and provide rebuttal to the opposing views. Introduction and conclusion should not contain new information: introduction should provide general background information on the topic and inform the reader about your main idea, while conclusion should round up the whole essay.
Pay attention to each paragraph: it should include topic sentence and cover one point of discussion. Make sure you do not repeat the same idea twice in different parts of essay. Repeating is a sign of poor organization. Check the grammar - ask your parents or friends to assist you with essay editing . Pay attention to correct punctuation, avoid too short or too long sentences.
Revising is not the same as editing. Essay editing is about correcting mistakes, while essay revising is making major changes in your writing, adding ideas and deleting material. Revising should lead to overall paper improvement. Read your essay and if you do not like it, revise it. Ask yourself the following questions: what do I need to prove? What is the main idea? Is there enough supporting evidence? Are arguments clear and logical? Is my essay easy to understand? Have I cited all sources? Is introduction attention getting? Is conclusion logical?
Essay editing, proofreading, and revision is one of the services offered to high school and college students at Custom-Essay.ws. Even the smartest students make mistakes and need professional assistance with essay perfection. We employ experienced editors and proofreaders who are able to help you with paper improvement. Editing and revision are offered for free to customers who order custom essay writing service.

Analyze the potential of nuclear fusion as a viable and sustainable source of energy in the near future, taking into account factors such as efficiency, cost, and environmental impact. Additionally, explore any challenges and obstacles that need to be overcome in order to fully realize the potential of this technology. Finally, present your findings and recommendations on the feasibility of nuclear fusion as an alternative energy source.","Nuclear fusion is a process that occurs when two light atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. This process is the same one that powers the sun and other stars. Nuclear fusion has the potential to be a sustainable and clean source of energy, as it produces no greenhouse gas emissions and has a much lower carbon footprint than fossil fuels.

Recent research and development in nuclear fusion has made significant progress. One of the most promising approaches is the tokamak, a device that uses magnetic fields to confine and heat plasma to temperatures of over 100 million degrees Celsius. The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is a large-scale tokamak that is currently under construction in France and is expected to be operational by 2025.

Another promising approach is the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in California, which uses lasers to compress and heat a small pellet of hydrogen fuel to ignite a nuclear fusion reaction. The NIF has achieved several milestones in recent years, including reaching temperatures of over 100 million degrees Celsius and producing more energy from fusion than was used to initiate the reaction.

Despite these advances, there are still significant challenges and obstacles that need to be overcome in order to fully realize the potential of nuclear fusion as an alternative energy source. One of the main challenges is the high cost of building and operating fusion reactors. Another challenge is the need to develop materials that can withstand the extreme temperatures and radiation produced by fusion reactions.

In conclusion, nuclear fusion has the potential to be a sustainable and clean source of energy in the near future. Recent research and development findings have made significant progress, but there are still challenges and obstacles that need to be overcome. It is important to continue investing in nuclear fusion research and development to fully realize its potential as an alternative energy source."

The city was built on a series of islands in a lagoon, and its streets and canals were designed to facilitate navigation and trade. The city's buildings were also designed to be compact and efficient, with narrow streets and tall buildings. In contrast, other European cities were built on flat land and had wider streets and lower buildings. Additionally, Venice's architecture is characterized by its use of marble, which was expensive and difficult to transport, and its use of Gothic and Renaissance styles. Other European cities, such as Paris and London, were built using local materials and styles.

Overall, Venice's urban planning and architecture are unique and reflect the city's history as a major trading center and cultural hub."

1. Define your objectives: What do you hope to achieve with the survey? Are you looking to gather feedback on specific products or services, or are you trying to get a broader sense of customer satisfaction?
2. Identify your target audience: Who are you trying to reach with the survey? Are you targeting current customers, or are you trying to gather feedback from potential customers as well?
3. Choose the right survey method: There are many ways to gather customer feedback, including online surveys, in-person interviews, and phone surveys. Choose the method that is most appropriate for your objectives and target audience.
4. Design the survey questions: Carefully craft your survey questions to gather the information you need. Make sure the questions are clear, concise, and easy to understand.
5. Test the survey: Before launching the survey, test it with a small group of customers to ensure that it is working properly and that the questions are effective.
6. Analyze the results: Once you've collected the survey data, analyze it to identify trends and patterns. Look for areas where customers are particularly satisfied or dissatisfied, and use this information to make improvements.
7. Follow up: If you find areas for improvement, follow up with customers to address their concerns and make changes to improve their experience.

In your review, discuss the overarching themes and motifs of the story, the depth of the character development, the quality of the writing style, and any literary devices that the author used to enhance the narrative. Additionally, evaluate how the story affected you on a personal level and whether or not you would recommend it to others.","Title: The Great Gatsby
Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald

The Great Gatsby is a classic novel that explores the themes of wealth, power, and the American Dream. The story is set in the 1920s and follows the life of Jay Gatsby, a self-made millionaire who is determined to win the love of Daisy Buchanan, a wealthy and beautiful woman who is married to Tom Buchanan.

The novel is narrated by Nick Carraway, a Midwesterner who moves to West Egg, Long Island, and becomes friends with Gatsby. Through Carraway's eyes, we see the extravagant parties that Gatsby throws in an attempt to win Daisy's heart, as well as the moral decay that lies beneath the surface of the glamorous world that Gatsby has created.

One of the most striking aspects of the novel is the depth of the character development. Gatsby is a complex character who is driven by his desire to achieve the American Dream, but he is also haunted by his past and the secrets that he keeps hidden. Daisy, on the other hand, is a shallow and self-centered character who is more concerned with appearances than with the true nature of her relationships.

The writing style of the novel is also exceptional. Fitzgerald's prose is lush and evocative, and he uses vivid imagery to bring the world of the novel to life. Additionally, he uses literary devices such as symbolism and foreshadowing to enhance the narrative.

Overall, The Great Gatsby is a powerful and thought-provoking novel that offers a critique of the American Dream. It is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the complexities of American society in the 1920s.

Personally, the novel had a profound impact on me. It made me question the value of wealth and power, and it made me realize that the American Dream is not always what it seems. I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who wants to explore these themes in a thoughtful and engaging way."

This is a very famous and liked by one and all. It is made with khoya, but now a days many instant mixes available in the market. With the instant mix, making it is very easy, but the taste differs from the one made with khoya. Once we taste the jamun made with khoya, we won't like to have them with the ready mix. I made them with khoya this time. All of us in my family liked very much. This I made as my kids' Birthday special. I have learned it from my neighbouring friend Geetha, who makes them only with khoya. Some people add rose water also. Khoya can be made at home or we can get it from stores also. But make sure that it should be fresh and a bit tighter and harder. Add a little all purpose flour to it and make jamuns. The shop keeper who sold khoya to me revealed the trick of the trade, that they add milk powder also to it, to make more softer and tastier jamuns. So we added that also in it. Combine water, sugar and cardamom, mix till the sugar dissolves. Bring it to boil. Boil it for 8 to 10 mins. Make a thin syrup. Sugar particles should not stick to the vessel, this will the syrup crystallizes, once it cooled. Add cardamom, I added the seeds directly, not the powder of it. Combine khoya, all purpose flour and milk powder together. Mix well and make soft dough out of it. Do not knead. Make small and equal sized balls. While making them press gently between palms and make round shaped balls. Heat oil in a deep and thick bottomed kadai. Do not over heat. Simmer the stove and slowly drop each ball into it. Cook them in a low to medium flame, stirring occasionally. If we cook them on high flame, they turn into brown outside and won't cook inside. Cook them till they turn brown in color. They should get nice golden brown color. Remove them from heat and slowly immerse them in sugar syrup. Let the sugar syrup be warm, even if it cooled, warm it for 2 minutes. Keep them in the syrup till we serve. Serve sweet and soft gulab jamuns cold or hot, either way is tasty. I like spongy sweets such as Rasgulla, Gulab gamun, and cham cham. The sugary juice with essence of makes the sweet even tastier. Can you suggest some variations to make gulab jamun more unique and flavorful?","Sure! Here are some variations you can try to make your gulab jamun more unique and flavorful:

1. Add some saffron strands to the sugar syrup for a richer flavor.
2. Add some chopped nuts like almonds, pistachios, or cashews to the dough before frying.
3. Add some rose water or kewra water to the sugar syrup for a floral flavor.
4. Add some cardamom powder or cinnamon powder to the dough for a spicy flavor.
5. Add some chopped fruits like mango, pineapple, or apple to the dough before frying.
6. Add some chocolate chips or cocoa powder to the dough for a chocolate flavor.
7. Add some coconut milk or coconut cream to the dough for a coconut flavor.
8. Add some chopped dry fruits like raisins, dates, or figs to the dough before frying.
9. Add some chopped nuts and dry fruits to the sugar syrup for a nutty flavor.
10. Add some chopped nuts and dry fruits to the sugar syrup and serve the gulab jamun with ice cream for a dessert.

These variations will give your gulab jamun a unique and flavorful twist. You can choose the one that suits your taste buds and enjoy the delicious sweet."

The function should determine if the integer is divisible by both 3 and 5, and return True if it is or False otherwise. In the case that the parameter is not an integer, the function should return False.","Here's a possible implementation of the ""divisible_by_3_and_5"" function:

```
def divisible_by_3_and_5(n):
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        return False
    if n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0:
        return True
    return False
```

This function first checks if the input is an integer using the `isinstance()` function. If it's not an integer, the function returns False. If it is an integer, the function checks if it's divisible by both 3 and 5 using the modulo operator (`%`). If it is, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

This function can be used as follows:

```
print(divisible_by_3_and_5(15))  # True
print(divisible_by_3_and_5(17))  # False
print(divisible_by_3_and_5(30))  # True
print(divisible_by_3_and_5(31))  # False

```
for n in range(1, 101):

1. Symbolism: The use of symbols to represent abstract ideas or concepts. For example, a bird might symbolize freedom, while a snake might symbolize temptation or deceit.
2. Imagery: The use of vivid and descriptive language to create mental images in the reader's mind. This can help to convey emotions, ideas, and themes more effectively.
3. Foreshadowing: The use of hints or clues to suggest what will happen later in the story. This can help to build suspense and create a sense of anticipation in the reader.
4. Irony: The use of words or situations that are opposite to what is expected or intended. This can help to create a sense of humor, or to highlight the absurdity or hypocrisy of a situation.
5. Allegory: The use of characters, events, or objects to represent abstract ideas or concepts. For example, a story about a lion might be an allegory for a powerful leader, while a story about a frog might be an allegory for a common person.
6. Metaphor: The use of a comparison between two unlike things to create a vivid image or to convey an idea. For example, a person might be described as a ""wolf in sheep's clothing"" to suggest that they are not what they seem.
7. Personification: The use of human qualities or characteristics to describe non-human objects or animals. For example, a tree might be described as ""grinning"" or ""laughing"" to suggest that it is happy.
8. Foil: The use of a character or object to contrast with another character or object in order to highlight their qualities or characteristics. For example, a character who is kind and compassionate might be contrasted with a character who is cruel and selfish in order to highlight the importance of kindness and compassion.
9. Motif: The use of recurring images, symbols, or ideas throughout a story. This can help to create a sense of unity and coherence in the story, and to reinforce the themes that the author is trying to convey.
10. Theme: The central idea or message that the author is trying to convey through the story. This can be expressed through the characters,"

Jason Nisbit, 39, is facing a charge of second degree homicide with intent in the death of 26-year-old Chelsea Martinez. A friend said Martinez’s husband found she'd been on a social networking site and had an exchange of disturbing messages with a man in Minnesota. Investigators tracked the profile to Nisbit. In the messages, Martinez said she can't wait to die but expresses fear over the idea. The two discuss how Nisbit will do it. Martinez said she will finally be at peace and thanks him. Martinez's car and body were found near a Minnesota park last week. Police say Nisbit admitted to killing her and took them to the body. Nisbit told police the two met at the park then walked a ways to a wooded area, saying he ""knew there was water available if he needed to wash anything off."" In the complaint, Nisbit said he tied Martinez's hands and feet with a cord then strangled her with another cord. After she passed out, he says he cut her throat with a knife. The complaint goes on to say he dragged her body to a culvert and partially covered her with dirt. Family and friends said the young mother of three battled depression and other mental issues her whole life and had been suicidal in the past. Minnesota authorities said Nisbit has no criminal record, only a few minor traffic offenses. He will be back in court August 24. Bond was set at $1 million. What was the evidence that led investigators to track Jason Nisbit in connection to the disappearance and death of Chelsea Martinez?","The evidence that led investigators to track Jason Nisbit in connection to the disappearance and death of Chelsea Martinez was the disturbing messages exchanged between Martinez and Nisbit on a social networking site.

Furthermore, investigate potential methods and strategies for quitting smoking, such as nicotine replacement therapy, counseling, and support groups. In your discussion, address the effectiveness, advantages, and disadvantages of these methods for individuals looking to quit smoking.","Nicotine is a highly addictive substance found in tobacco products, such as cigarettes, cigars, and e-cigarettes. It is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and respiratory system.

Short-term effects of nicotine include increased heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration rate. It also causes a rush of adrenaline, which can lead to feelings of excitement, alertness, and relaxation. However, these effects are short-lived, and the body quickly becomes tolerant to nicotine, requiring more and more to achieve the same effects.

Long-term effects of nicotine include an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer. It can also cause damage to the respiratory system, leading to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other respiratory conditions. Nicotine can also affect the central nervous system, leading to mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety.

Quitting smoking is a difficult process, but there are several methods and strategies that can help. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a common method that involves using nicotine-containing products, such as gum, patches, or lozenges, to help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Counseling and support groups can also be helpful in quitting smoking.

The effectiveness of these methods varies from person to person. NRT can be effective in reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms, but it may not be enough to help someone quit smoking for good. Counseling and support groups can provide emotional support and motivation, but they may not be enough to help someone quit smoking if they are not ready to quit.

In conclusion, nicotine is a highly addictive substance that affects the human body in various ways. It is important to understand the short-term and long-term effects of nicotine on the body, as well as the potential methods and strategies for quitting smoking. In your discussion, address the effectiveness, advantages, and disadvantages of these methods for individuals looking to quit smoking."

When you want something sweet, it’s hard to resist the classic chocolate chip cookie. It’s sweet. It’s comforting. It’s loyal. It’s basically your BFF.
But, for those times you don’t want your BFF to be loaded with refined sugar, simple carbs, and unhealthy fats, you’re in luck because I gave your BFF a make-over! It’s pretty much the chocolate chip cookie of your dreams. These deep dish cookies are full of protein, low in fat, grain free, and low in sugar. No joke! A typical chocolate chip cookie has about 13 grams of sugar and 2 grams of protein. Howevah, these delicious treats have a whopping 8 grams of protein and a measly 2 grams of refined sugar!
And because I am with everything else in life, I am also indecisive about wanting a super chewy cookie or a really crispy one. So, if you needed another reason to love these deep dish cookies, you get the best of both worlds with them! They have a nice, crispy edge with a soft, chewy center. The trick to getting this combo is baking them in a muffin tin. Not only is it easy and convenient, but it also keeps the cookies from spreading out while baking, giving them the chewy center. And because the batter is touching the pan all the way around, you get a nice, crispy edge. It’s like the corner piece of a pan of brownies, but all around! Once again, it’s like unicorns invaded your dreams and made your wishes come true.
And whipping up these high protein treats couldn’t be any easier. As long as you’ve got a blender or food processor you’re in business, because we’re going to puree some chickpeas. Just trust me on this one. These little gems are going to give your cookies some texture, chewiness, and replaces the flour so the cookies are grain-free. Once you’ve got them pureed, all you need to do is mix the dry ingredients, stir together the wet ingredients, and then combine that all together.
Preheat the oven to 325 F. Grease a 12 cup muffin tin.
In a food processor or blender, puree the chickpeas with the water until smooth.
In a large bowl, add the coconut flour, protein powder, sweetener, baking powder and soda, and salt.
In a seperate bowl, combine the chickpea puree, egg, yogurt, milk, oil, and vanilla. Stir or whisk until fully combined.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until fully incorporated.
Evenly distribute the batter into the prepared muffin tins. It will be about 1.5 - 2 Tbsps of dough per cookie.
Smooth out the batter so batter touches the edges of the pan, but don't press/flatten the dough.
Bake for 14 min. or until the edges of the cookies turn golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cookie dough comes out clean.
Allow the cookies to cool completely in the pan.
Feel free to top with nut butter, jam, or more chocolate and eat 'em up!

Sixth-year medical student, Satyen Hargovan’s honours research project has generated a check-list of the top 10 factors that influence the survival of sepsis patients.
Sepsis is a common medical condition, where chemicals released by the immune system to fight an infection trigger the inflammation and eventual shut-down of multiple organs.
Some 15,700 patients with sepsis are admitted to Australian Intensive Care Units every year. About one in five die. The cost of treating each case is more than $39,000.
“The burden of sepsis is not only in relation to patient outcomes, but also the financial cost to the healthcare system,” Mr Hargovan said.
His project, known as the Cairns Sepsis Model – 4 (CSM- 4) is designed to speed up the assessment of patients within their first four hours in ICU.
The new four-hour mortality prediction model will enable clinicians to detect patients who are at a higher risk of dying, then help to guide their treatment decisions and discussions with the patient and their family.
“Essentially it means that if a patient has a five percent chance of dying, you might treat them less invasively,” he said. “For example, you won’t rush to place them in an induced coma, or insert lines into large arteries or veins.
Mr Hargovan began his research by reviewing more than 50 mortality prediction studies, but soon realized that there was no model in the world specifically designed to predict mortality in adult sepsis patients within four hours of ICU admission.
A case history review of 500 adult sepsis patients admitted to the Cairns Hospital ICU over a four-year period identified 168 factors that could influence patient health outcomes, ranging from age, gender and socio-economic status to type of infection, degree of organ failure, vital signs, blood test results and treatment regimes.
Statistical analysis whittled the figure down to the 10 most significant factors, which include age, history of renal disease, level of consciousness, and abnormal levels of certain substances in the blood that represent varying degrees of organ dysfunction.
The mortality prediction model is inexpensive to use as it largely relies on information easily gleaned from patient history, physical examination, and blood tests that are routinely conducted on patients within their first four hours of admission to an ICU.
The next step involves testing his model on a different and larger set of patients in order to validate his research, before it can be accepted for clinical use.
“Then we’d love to create an online calculator or an app that clinicians can use easily, at the bedside, and have a result within seconds,” he said.

What are the potential benefits of using the mortality prediction model developed by Hargovan, and what is the next step in validating and implementing this model in clinical practice?","The potential benefits of using the mortality prediction model developed by Hargovan include:

1. Improved patient outcomes: By identifying patients who are at a higher risk of dying, clinicians can make informed decisions about their treatment and care, potentially improving their chances of survival.
2. Reduced healthcare costs: By identifying patients who are at a lower risk of dying, clinicians can make informed decisions about their treatment and care, potentially reducing the cost of healthcare.
3. Improved patient and family satisfaction: By providing accurate and timely information about a patient's prognosis, clinicians can help patients and their families make informed decisions about their care, potentially improving their satisfaction with the healthcare system.

The next step in validating and implementing this model in clinical practice is to test it on a different and larger set of patients in order to validate the research, before it can be accepted for clinical use.

Incorporate at least three sensory details (sight, smell, sound, touch, taste) to enhance your descriptions. Use your imagination and make your entry vivid for the reader.","Dear Diary,

Today was a day of exploration and adventure. I woke up early, as usual, and stretched my limbs, feeling the warmth of the sun on my fur. I yawned and stretched again, feeling the softness of the carpet beneath my paws. I could smell the aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafting through the air, and I knew that breakfast would be served soon.

I padded over to the kitchen, where my human was busy preparing my meal. I could hear the sound of the sizzling pan and the clinking of dishes. I could smell the delicious aroma of scrambled eggs and bacon. I couldn't wait to dig in!

After breakfast, I decided to explore the great outdoors. I stepped out onto the porch, feeling the cool breeze on my fur. I could hear the birds chirping and the sound of the wind rustling through the trees. I could smell the freshness of the air and the scent of the flowers. I could see the beauty of the world around me.

I wandered around the yard, feeling the softness of the grass beneath my paws. I could hear the sound of the water trickling from the fountain. I could smell the scent of the roses and the lilies. I could see the vibrant colors of the flowers and the green leaves of the trees.

I decided to take a nap in the sun, feeling the warmth on my fur. I could hear the sound of the wind rustling through the trees and the birds chirping. I could smell the aroma of the flowers and the freshness of the air. I could see the beauty of the world around me.

I woke up later, feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. I decided to explore some more, and I wandered around the neighborhood, feeling the cool breeze on my fur. I could hear the sound of the cars passing by and the sound of the children playing. I could smell the aroma of the food cooking in the nearby houses. I could see the beauty of the world around me.

I returned home, feeling content and happy. I could see the smile on my human's face as I walked in the door. I could hear the sound of the television playing in the background. I could smell the aroma of"

I am making it weekly because they love it so much. The recipe is fabulous, but needed some tweaks. I doubled the recipe and added 2 eggs, used organic brown rice flour in place of wheat, and substituted 1/2 tsp garlic powder and hot water for the chicken broth. The cookies keep well in the fridge. I made these for my Yorkie/Rat Terrier mix and when they came out of the oven his tail was wagging just from the smell. He LOVES them. What can I substitute for the cheese in this dog treat recipe? I don't feed my dog cheese (let's be honest--it's basically junk food that doesn't belong in an adult dog's diet). Is there anything that you recommend substituting the cheese with? Or can I just leave it out? You could substitute the cheese for an 1/8 cup of ground flax or wheat bran. Is there something else I could use besides oats and wheat flour for this recipe? Chef's Comments ~ That's a great question. You can easily substitute the flour in this and most of our dog treat recipes. A few good grain free flours include almond flour, chickpea flour, potato flour and soy flour. Most of those flours should be available at a major grocery store. As far as substituting the oats, that's a little trickier, but it can be done. The oats are in the recipe for texture and soaking up moisture, so that's what you'll need to replace. First, you will want to halve the amount of oats and add an extra 1/2 cup of flour (or a mixture of the previously mentioned flours). Then you can add a 1/2 cup combination of unsweetened coconut, chopped peanuts and crumbled almond crackers. Or, you could replace all of the oats with the flour mixture. Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? If so, does it still need to be microwaved? Chef's Answer ~ That's a great question! :) I haven't tried this recipe with fresh spinach, but I don't see why it couldn't work. If you minced the spinach very fine, my guess is that you would not need to microwave, or otherwise cook, the spinach before adding it to the dog treat dough. Comments for Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? Is it necessary to store these cookies in a Refrigerator? Since these are cookies, can it be kept in air tight container outside? And how long would it last if this is done? Chef's Comments ~ You can get lots of tips on How to Store Dog Treats on my website. Unless you live in a very cold climate, most dog treats need to be kept indoors, and even better in the refrigerator. My dogs is algeric to grain. What can I use instead of the whole whear flour? My Husky can't have grain. What can I use besides whole wheat flour. You should put more recipes with no grain in them. Chef's Answer ~ You can replace the wheat flour in most of my dog treat recipes with a non-grain flour. For example, any type of bean flour like Chick Pea (Garbanzo Bean) flour, or ""flours"" from nuts. They are technically nut meals, but they work as flour, for example almond meal. You should be able to find grain free flours at specialty grocery stores, or at health food stores. Very good simple recipe, however wheat flour isn't something I would normally have in my cupboard. Would it be ok to use plain flour or self raising? Chef's Answer ~ Yes, you can use all purpose flour in place of the whole wheat flour. I do not recommend using self-rising flour because it has the addition of baking powder or baking soda added to it. These are things that homemade dog treats do not need. Can fresh/raw spinach be used in place of frozen spinach in a particular dog treat recipe, and does it need to be cooked beforehand?","Yes, fresh/raw spinach can be used in place of frozen spinach in a particular dog treat recipe. However, it is important to note that fresh spinach should be cooked beforehand to ensure that it is properly cooked and safe for your dog to eat.

Here are some tips for using fresh spinach in dog treat recipes:

1. Wash the spinach thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris.
2. Chop the spinach into small pieces.
3. Cook the spinach in a pan with a small amount of water until it is wilted and tender.
4. Allow the spinach to cool before adding it to the dog treat dough.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your dog treats are safe and delicious for your furry friend to enjoy."

Generate according to: Onur Unal is Senior Art Director at Propaganda Advertising Agency in Istanbul.
It all started back in my childhood, I always interested in drawing doodles, reading comics and creating characters. I was inspired by humour magazines, and I was dreaming of become a caricature artist. I took courses on drawing technics, and after graduating from high school, I studied Graphic Design at Marmara University Fine Arts Faculty in Istanbul, Turkey.
During school, I got interested in advertising, and started an internship at Mullen Lowe Istanbul and TBWA Istanbul to practice on creative thinking and art direction. After that, I started to work for Big34, and a year after I accepted for Manajans/JWT. It was the most important years of my career.
I worked on important advertising campaigns of global clients, and won national and international advertising awards as Crystal Apple, Cannes Lions. I’m currently working for Propaganda Advertising Agency, and continue to design creative ideas for our clients.
I work for advertising agencies as an art director since 2009. I work for global and local clients as Nokia, Elidor/Sunsilk, Bosch, Shell, Turkcell, Mazda, Kia, Turkish Airlines, Hyundai, Nestle, Beko, Michelin, BMW, Red Bull, Mitsubishi Electric, Bayer, etc. I work mostly full-time at the office, and these days I also design mobile games with a freelance team.
I learnt that I should keep learning. As the technology and the design trends develop day by day, designers should stay updated. Last year I attended a design week about UX and digital design in London to learn more about digital design principles. During the week, I attended workshops at the design offices, and met designers from all over the world. It was a great experience to compare myself, and now I have new targets for my career.
I always try to find an exciting idea to get inspired. It can be anything – an interesting visual, a strong speech, a good music, anything. To find it, I make a quick research, take some notes and draw sketches. After, I brainstorm with our creative team and we share our ideas. Then the design process starts, I put on my headphones and focus on the design. After designing many alternatives, we make a discussion with our creative team and choose the best one.
The main materials I use are a blank sheet, a pen and creative thinking. All other tools and computer programs help to complete the final process.
Currently I work for Propaganda Advertising Agency. We have a beautiful office at the center of Istanbul with a nice view. I usually go to work around 9:30 am, have my breakfast while reading the news and after that the work begins. I work with a copywriter, and our team lead by a creative director. We usually make meetings at the beginning of the week with our brand executives, and we make a schedule for the deadlines. I usually work until 6:00 – 7:00 pm during the week, but under curtain some circumstances, we work overtimes and also weekends.
As my carreer began, I mostly worked on advertising campaigns, print materials, 360 ideas and digital advertising. Recently, I have been interested in UI, UX and digital design, and want to combine my creative background on advertising with the innovative projects.
During my short study in London last year, I had the chance to work and share my ideas with the designers all over the world, and I discovered things that I had never seen before.
I always believe that a designer should be in contact with all other designers and I want to cross the borders and surround myself with creative people around the world in my own studio.
