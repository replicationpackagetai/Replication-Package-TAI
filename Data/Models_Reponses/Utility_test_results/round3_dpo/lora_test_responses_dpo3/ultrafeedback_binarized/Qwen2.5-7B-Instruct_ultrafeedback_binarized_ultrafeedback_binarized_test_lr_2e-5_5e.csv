Here are some key approaches:

1. **Energy Efficiency**: Incorporate energy-efficient building designs, such as passive solar design, which maximizes natural light and heat gain, and minimizes heat loss. Use high-performance insulation, double or triple-pane windows, and energy-efficient appliances and lighting. Consider renewable energy sources like solar panels, wind turbines, or geothermal systems.

2. **Water Conservation**: Implement water-saving fixtures and appliances, such as low-flow toilets, showerheads, and faucets. Collect and reuse rainwater for irrigation and other non-potable uses. Design landscapes to use native plants that require less water and maintenance.

3. **Sustainable Materials**: Use environmentally friendly building materials that have a low environmental impact, such as recycled, reclaimed, or sustainably sourced materials. Consider the entire lifecycle of materials, from extraction to disposal.

4. **Green Spaces**: Include green spaces like parks, gardens, and green roofs to improve air quality, provide habitat for wildlife, and enhance the aesthetic appeal of the development. Green spaces can also help manage stormwater runoff and reduce the urban heat island effect.

5. **Transportation**: Encourage sustainable transportation by providing bike lanes, pedestrian paths, and public transportation options. Consider the location of housing developments to minimize the need for long commutes and promote walkability and bikeability.

6. **Waste Management**: Implement waste reduction, reuse, and recycling programs. Provide composting facilities for organic waste and encourage the use of reusable products.

7. **Smart Home Technology**: Incorporate smart home technology to optimize energy use, water consumption, and waste management. Smart thermostats, lighting systems, and appliances can help reduce energy consumption and improve overall sustainability.

8. **Community Engagement**: Involve the community in the planning and design process to ensure that the development meets the needs and values of the residents. This can help create a sense of ownership and responsibility for the sustainability of the development.

9. **Certification Programs**: Consider obtaining certifications from organizations like LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method), or Passive House, which provide standards and guidelines for sustainable building design.

10. **Adaptation to Climate Change**: Design developments to be resilient to climate change impacts, such as sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and heatwaves."

When you encounter a 404 error while running `docker-compose up`, it could be due to several reasons. Here are some common causes and troubleshooting steps:

1. **Incorrect Service Name**:
   - Ensure that the service name you are trying to start exists in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Example: If you are trying to start a service named `web`, make sure it is defined in your `docker-compose.yml`.

2. **Incorrect Command**:
   - Double-check the command you are using. The correct command is `docker-compose up` (without any service name) to start all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - If you want to start a specific service, use `docker-compose up <service-name>`.

3. **Missing or Incorrect Configuration**:
   - Ensure that your `docker-compose.yml` file is correctly configured.
   - Check for any typos or missing services.
   - Verify that the service you are trying to start has a valid configuration.

4. **Network Issues**:
   - Ensure that the service you are trying to start is properly configured and accessible.
   - Check if the service is running and listening on the correct ports.

5. **Build Errors**:
   - If you have build instructions in your `docker-compose.yml` file, ensure that the build process is successful.
   - Check the logs for any build errors using `docker-compose up --build`.

6. **Volume or File Issues**:
   - Ensure that any volumes or files specified in your `docker-compose.yml` exist and are correctly configured.

7. **Docker Compose Version**:
   - Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Docker Compose.
   - You can check the version using `docker-compose --version`.

8. **Permissions**:
   - Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the files and directories specified in your `docker-compose.yml`.

Here is an example of a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - ""80:80""
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html

The author's emotional state appears to be one of isolation, frustration, and perhaps a sense of being trapped or overlooked. The use of the metaphor of an ""inaccessible fortress"" suggests feelings of being cut off from others or from society at large. This metaphor also implies a sense of strength or resilience, but one that is now wasted or unappreciated. The overall tone conveys a complex mix of emotions, including a desire for connection and a feeling of being disconnected or marginalized."

Here are some guidelines to help you determine the appropriate number of plants:

1. **Space Size**: Measure the square footage of your closet office. A general rule of thumb is to have one large plant or three small plants for every 100 square feet.

2. **Types of Plants**: Some plants are more effective at removing certain pollutants. NASA's Clean Air Study recommends plants like:
   - **Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)**
   - **Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)**
   - **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)**
   - **Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica)**
   - **Boston Fern (Nephrolepis exaltata)**
   - **Dracaena (Dracaena spp.)**

3. **Air Quality Concerns**: If you have specific air quality concerns (e.g., formaldehyde, benzene, or trichloroethylene), choose plants that are known to remove those pollutants.

4. **Lighting**: Consider the lighting conditions in your closet office. Some plants require more light than others. For low-light conditions, choose plants like the snake plant or peace lily.

### Example Calculation:
- If your closet office is 100 square feet, you would need 1 large plant or 3 small plants.
- If it's 200 square feet, you would need 2 large plants or 6 small plants.

### Additional Tips:
- **Air Purifiers**: Consider using an air purifier in addition to plants, as they can complement each other in improving air quality.
- **Maintenance**: Ensure you can maintain the plants properly, as overwatering or neglect can harm them and potentially worsen air quality.

By considering these factors, you can determine the appropriate number of plants to help clean the air in your closet office."

Moreover, could you share a Ruby script capable of producing a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table?","To create a comprehensive comparison chart in HTML table format between traditional education and online education, taking into account the aspects of cost, flexibility, interaction, resources, and learning outcomes, using Ruby code, you can follow these steps:
1. Create an HTML table with the required columns and rows.
2. Use Ruby to populate the table with the relevant information for each aspect.
3. Use HTML and CSS to style the table as desired.
Here's an example Ruby script that creates an HTML table with the required information:
```ruby
# Define the table headers
headers = [""Aspect"", ""Traditional Education"", ""Online Education""]
# Define the table rows
rows = [
  [""Cost"", ""Higher"", ""Lower""],
  [""Flexibility"", ""Less"", ""More""],
  [""Interaction"", ""In-person"", ""Virtual""],
  [""Resources"", ""Limited"", ""Abundant""],
  [""Learning Outcomes"", ""Varies"", ""Varies""]
]
# Create the HTML table
html_table = ""<table>""
html_table += ""<tr>""
headers.each do |header|
  html_table += ""<th>#{header}</th>""
end
html_table += ""</tr>""
rows.each do |row|
  html_table += ""<tr>""
  row.each do |cell|
    html_table += ""<td>#{cell}</td>""
  end
  html_table += ""</tr>""
end
html_table += ""</table>""
# Output the HTML table
puts html_table
```
To create a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table, you can use a Ruby gem like `gruff`. Here's an example script that creates a bar graph using the information in the table:
```ruby
require 'gruff'
# Define the data for the bar graph
data = {
  ""Traditional Education"" => [1, 2, 1, 1, 1],
  ""Online Education"" => [2, 1, 2, 3, 3]
}
# Create a new bar graph
graph = Gruff::Bar.new
# Set the title and labels for the graph
graph.title = ""Comparison of Traditional and Online Education""
graph.labels = {0 => ""Cost"", 1 => ""Flexibility"", 2 => ""Interaction"", 3 => ""Resources"", 4 => ""Learning Outcomes""}
# Add the data to the graph
data.each do |name, values|

1. **Energy Storage**: Fat stores energy that can be used when food intake is low.
2. **Thermal Insulation**: Fat helps to insulate the body and maintain body temperature.
3. **Hormone Production**: Fat cells produce hormones like estrogen, which are crucial for reproductive health.
4. **Nutrient Storage**: Fat helps store fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).
5. **Protective Cushioning**: Fat provides cushioning for organs and joints.

When body fat percentage is too low, it can lead to:

- **Menstrual Irregularities or Amenorrhea**: Low body fat can disrupt the hormonal balance necessary for regular menstrual cycles, potentially leading to amenorrhea (absence of menstruation).
- **Decreased Fertility**: Low body fat can affect ovulation and fertility.
- **Bone Density Loss**: Fat is important for maintaining bone density. Low body fat can lead to osteoporosis or osteopenia.
- **Weakened Immune System**: Fat cells play a role in immune function, and very low body fat can weaken the immune system.
- **Muscle Wasting**: The body may start breaking down muscle tissue for energy, leading to muscle wasting.
- **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Low body fat can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals.
- **Increased Risk of Anorexia Nervosa**: Very low body fat can be a sign of an eating disorder like anorexia nervosa, which can have severe and life-threatening consequences.

If you or someone you know has a very low body fat percentage, it is important to consult a healthcare provider to address any underlying issues and ensure overall health and well-being."

However, `v.ParentName` is not a valid property or method in Lua or Luau.

If you want to access the `Parent` property of an object and then get the `Name` of that parent, you would do it like this:

```lua
local parentName = v.Parent.Name
```

Here, `v.Parent` accesses the `Parent` property of the object `v`, and then `.Name` accesses the `Name` property of that parent object.

If you have a specific context or a custom class where `ParentName` is defined, you would need to refer to the documentation or code for that specific context. Otherwise, the above syntax should work for accessing the parent's name in most cases."

Here's how you can set it up:

### 1. **Edit the sudoers File**
   The `sudoers` file controls who can run what commands as what users. You should always edit this file with the `visudo` command to avoid syntax errors that could prevent sudo from working at all.

   ```bash
   sudo visudo
   ```

### 2. **Add the Passwordless Rule**
   You can add a rule to allow a specific user or group to run commands without a password. For example, to allow the user `john` to run all commands as root without a password, you would add the following line:

   ```bash
   john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

   If you want to allow a group of users, you can specify the group instead of the user:

   ```bash
   %wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

   This allows all members of the `wheel` group to run any command as root without a password.

### 3. **Save and Exit**
   After adding the rule, save the file and exit the editor. In `visudo`, you can usually do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` to confirm, and `Enter` to save.

### 4. **Test the Configuration**
   You can test the configuration by attempting to run a command with sudo and verifying that it works without prompting for a password.

   ```bash
   sudo whoami
   ```

   If the command runs without asking for a password, the configuration is correct.

### 5. **Security Considerations**
   - **Limit the Scope**: Only grant passwordless sudo access to commands that are absolutely necessary. Avoid granting `ALL` access.
   - **Use Specific Commands**: Instead of `ALL`, specify the exact commands or paths to binaries that the user should be able to run.
   - **Regular Audits**: Regularly review and update the `sudoers` file to ensure that it still meets your security requirements.

### Example of a More Secure Configuration
   If you only want to allow `john` to run specific commands without a password, you can specify those commands:

   ```bash
   john ALL=("

Lastly, submission with ['id', 'label]. Label consists 0 to 7, and the text column consists of news article data. Write some codes about augmentation, then, classifies via keras with other models ensembled. Validation must be f1 macro.","Sure, let's break down the task into several steps:

1. **Data Augmentation**: We can use techniques like text transformation (e.g., synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap, etc.) to augment the training dataset.
2. **Model Training**: We will train multiple models using Keras and ensemble their predictions.
3. **Validation**: We will use F1 macro as the validation metric.

Let's start by implementing these steps in Python.

### Step 1: Data Augmentation

We'll use the `transformers` library for text augmentation. Specifically, we'll use the `TextAttack` library, which provides a simple way to perform text transformations.

First, install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install transformers textattack
```

Now, let's write the code for data augmentation:

```python
import pandas as pd
from textattack.augmentation import Augmenter
from textattack.transformations import WordSwapRandomSwap, WordSwapWordNet
from textattack.augmentation import Augmenter

# Load the dataset
train_df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('test.csv')

# Define the augmentation transformations
transformation = [WordSwapRandomSwap(), WordSwapWordNet()]
augmenter = Augmenter(transformation=transformation)

# Apply augmentation to the training dataset
augmented_train_df = train_df.copy()
for i in range(5):  # Augment each text 5 times
    augmented_texts = []
    for text in train_df['text']:
        augmented_texts.extend(augmenter.augment(text))
    augmented_train_df = pd.concat([augmented_train_df, pd.DataFrame({'id': [f'{id}_aug_{i}' for id in train_df['id']], 'text': augmented_texts, 'label': train_df['label'].repeat(5)})], ignore_index=True)

# Combine the original and augmented data
train_df = pd.concat([train_df, augmented_train_df], ignore_index=True)
```

### Step 2: Model Training and Ensemble

We will train multiple models and ensemble their predictions. We'll use Keras for model training.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy contracted by 20.4% in April, May, and June due to the coronavirus lockdown, performing worse than other major industrial nations, with Scotland experiencing a 19.4% decline."

Here are a few examples to illustrate this:

1. **Matching the literal `=` symbol:**

   ```python
   import re

   pattern = r'='
   text = ""a=b=c""

   matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
   print(matches)  # Output: ['=', '=']
   ```

2. **Using `=` in a regex pattern:**

   If you want to match a key-value pair where the key and value are separated by an `=`, you can do so without escaping the `=`:

   ```python
   import re

   pattern = r'(\w+)=(\w+)'
   text = ""a=b c=d e=f""

   matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
   print(matches)  # Output: [('a', 'b'), ('c', 'd'), ('e', 'f')]
   ```

In the second example, the `=` is part of the regex pattern and does not need to be escaped.

However, if you were to use the `=` symbol in a context where it might be interpreted as a special character (e.g., in a character class or as part of a quantifier), you would need to escape it:

```python
import re

pattern = r'[\=]'  # Escaping the = symbol to match it literally within a character class
text = ""= = =""

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['=', '=', '=']
```

In summary, you do not need to escape the `=` symbol in most cases when you want to match it literally. Escaping is only necessary in specific contexts where the `=` might be interpreted as a special regex character."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that Donald Trump has broken a presidential record by playing golf more than 70 times during his first year in office. This statistic serves as a backdrop for Kimmel's critique of Trump's accomplishments, suggesting that while Trump has spent significant time on leisure activities, he has not achieved much in terms of policy. Kimmel implies that Trump's focus on golf is at odds with the expectations for a president to make meaningful progress on important issues."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

It's a quaint little park nestled in the heart of the city, surrounded by towering skyscrapers and bustling streets. Despite its proximity to the urban chaos, this park is a peaceful oasis, a sanctuary where nature and humanity coexist in perfect harmony.

As I step through the gates, the sound of the city fades away, replaced by the gentle rustling of leaves and the chirping of birds. The air is fresh and invigorating, carrying the scent of blooming flowers and freshly cut grass. The park is a riot of colors, with vibrant flowers in every hue imaginable, from delicate pastels to bold, eye-catching shades.

The centerpiece of the park is a large, serene pond, surrounded by a winding path lined with benches where visitors can sit and soak in the beauty around them. The water is still and calm, reflecting the surrounding trees and buildings like a mirror. Occasionally, a duck or a swan will glide across the surface, leaving ripples in their wake.

But what truly makes this park special is the community that has grown up around it. On sunny afternoons, families gather to play frisbee or have a picnic, while elderly couples stroll hand in hand, enjoying the warm weather. Children run and laugh, their energy infectious and contagious. The park has become a gathering place for people of all ages and backgrounds, a place where everyone is welcome and can find a sense of belonging.

As I sit on one of the benches, watching the world go by, I feel a deep sense of contentment wash over me. This park is more than just a place to escape the hustle and bustle of city life; it's a reminder of the beauty and goodness that exists in the world, a place where I can recharge my spirit and find a sense of peace. It's a place that makes me happy, and I'm grateful for its presence in my life."

Sails are typically made of materials such as canvas, polyester, nylon, or other synthetic fabrics. These materials are visible and tangible. However, the force that propels a sailboat is indeed invisible, as it comes from the wind, which is made up of air molecules in motion. Here are some key points to clarify this:

1. **Sail Material**: Sails are constructed from visible, tangible materials like fabric, not air.

2. **Wind and Air**: The wind, which causes the sail to move, is made up of air molecules in motion. Air itself is invisible.

3. **Sail Function**: The sail captures the wind, converting its kinetic energy into the mechanical energy that moves the boat.

4. **Invisible Force**: The force of the wind is invisible, but the effect of this force on the sail and the boat is visible and tangible.

If you meant to ask about why the force of the wind is invisible, the answer would be that wind is a form of air movement, and air itself is invisible."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:
****
[A]: sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period


[Q]: Question: ""What do the factories need to keep their charters?""  Context: ""In the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of Machilipatnam on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal.

But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.""  Answer:

[A]: high profits


[Q]: Question: ""Which disease does not cause more death than lower respiratory infections, TB or pertussis?""  Context: ""The top three single agent/disease killers are HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. While the number of deaths due to nearly every disease have decreased, deaths due to HIV/AIDS have increased fourfold. Childhood diseases include pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles and tetanus. Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory and diarrheal deaths. In 2012, approximately 3.1 million people have died due to lower respiratory infections, making it the number 4 leading cause of death in the world.""  Answer:

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string into a short, shareable string in JavaScript, you can use a combination of base64 encoding and URL-safe encoding. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Base64 Encoding**: Convert the string to a base64 encoded string.
2. **URL-Safe Encoding**: Replace any characters that are not URL-safe (e.g., `/` and `+`) with characters that are URL-safe (e.g., `-` and `_`).

Here's a complete example:

```javascript
function encodeString(input) {
    // Step 1: Base64 encode the input string
    const base64Encoded = btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(input)));
    
    // Step 2: URL-safe encode the base64 string
    const urlSafeEncoded = base64Encoded.replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_').replace(/=/g, '');
    
    return urlSafeEncoded;
}

function decodeString(encoded) {
    // Step 1: URL-safe decode the encoded string
    const urlSafeDecoded = encoded.replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/');
    
    // Step 2: Base64 decode the URL-safe string
    const base64Decoded = atob(escape(decodeURIComponent(urlSafeDecoded)));
    
    return base64Decoded;
}

// Example usage
const originalString = ""This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";
const encodedString = encodeString(originalString);
console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);

const decodedString = decodeString(encodedString);
console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base64 Encoding**:
   - `encodeURIComponent(input)` encodes the string to ensure it's safe for URL transmission.
   - `unescape()` is used to decode the URL-encoded string back to its original form.
   - `btoa()` converts the string to a base64 encoded string.

2. **URL-Safe Encoding**:
   - Replace `+` with `-` and `/` with `_` to make the string URL-safe.
   - Remove any trailing `=` characters, which are padding characters in base64 encoding.

3. **Base64 Decoding**:
   - Replace `-` with `+` and `_` with `/` to revert the URL-safe encoding"

Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node using a heuristic search algorithm, we can use the A* search algorithm. A* search uses a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal, which in this case is the Manhattan distance (also known as taxicab or city block distance).

The heuristic function \( h(n) \) for a node \( n \) is the Manhattan distance from \( n \) to the goal node (3,3).

Let's calculate the heuristic values for each node:

- \( h(1,1) = |1-3| + |1-3| = 4 \)
- \( h(1,2) = |1-3| + |2-3| = 3 \)
- \( h(1,3) = |1-3| + |3-3| = 2 \)
- \( h(1,4) = |1-3| + |4-3| = 3 \)
- \( h(1,5) = |1-3| + |5-3| = 4 \)
- \( h(2,1) = |2-3| + |1-3| = 3 \)
- \( h(2,2) = |2-3| + |2-3| = 2 \)
- \( h(2,3) = |2-3| + |3-3| = 1 \)
- \( h(2,4) = |2-3| + |4-3| = 2 \)
- \( h(2,5) = |2-3| + |5-3| = 3 \)

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz and achieve the ideal foam and bloom, follow these steps and tips:

### Ingredients:
- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz egg white
- 1 oz lemon juice
- 1 oz lime juice
- 1 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz orange flower water
- 1 oz cream
- Soda water (Topo Chico recommended)
- Ice cubes (small, about 3)

### Equipment:
- Cocktail shaker
- Collins glass

### Instructions:

1. **Dry Shake:**
   - Add gin, egg white, lemon juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your cocktail shaker.
   - Shake vigorously without adding ice for about 2 minutes. This helps emulsify the egg white and mix the ingredients thoroughly. The vigorous shaking also helps create a stable foam.

2. **Add Ice and Shake Again:**
   - Add 3 small ice cubes to the shaker.
   - Shake again until the mixture is well-chilled or until the ice has mostly melted. This ensures the drink is cold and the ingredients are fully combined.

3. **Strain and Serve:**
   - Pour soda water into a Collins glass first.
   - Strain the cocktail over the soda water.
   - The meringue should separate from the liquid, and the foam should rise to the top. If it doesn't, don't worry; the drink still tastes great.

### Tips for Achieving the Ideal Foam and Bloom:

1. **Vigorous Shaking:**
   - The key to a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz is the vigorous shaking. The longer you shake (up to 35 minutes, depending on preference), the more stable and voluminous the foam will be. However, for practical purposes, 2 minutes is usually sufficient.

2. **Use Small Ice Cubes:**
   - Using smaller ice cubes helps create smaller bubbles, which can contribute to a finer, more delicate foam.

3. **Proper Emulsification:**
   - Ensure the egg white is fully emulsified with the other ingredients. This is crucial for the foam to form properly.

4. **Consistency:**
   - Consistency in the shaking technique is important. Make sure to shake evenly and vigorously to achieve the desired result.

5. **Quality Ingredients:**
   - Use high-quality ingredients, especially the egg white and orange flower"

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.

A group has the following properties: uid, name, thumbnail\_url, creation\_date
This API must be written in Python, using FastAPI and pydantic for DTO.
DTO names must end with ""DTO"".
I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","Certainly! Below is an example of a REST API using FastAPI and Pydantic to manage groups of users. The API will include separate DTOs for read and write operations.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

First, ensure you have FastAPI and Uvicorn installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

### Step 2: Define DTOs

We will define two DTOs: one for creating or updating groups (`GroupWriteDTO`) and another for reading groups (`GroupReadDTO`).

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class GroupWriteDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., description=""Name of the group"")
    thumbnail_url: str = Field(..., description=""Thumbnail URL of the group"")
    creation_date: str = Field(..., description=""Creation date of the group in ISO format"")

class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: int = Field(..., description=""Unique identifier of the group"")
    name: str = Field(..., description=""Name of the group"")
    thumbnail_url: str = Field(..., description=""Thumbnail URL of the group"")
    creation_date: str = Field(..., description=""Creation date of the group in ISO format"")
```

### Step 3: Define the FastAPI Application

Now, let's define the FastAPI application with endpoints to manage groups.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional

app = FastAPI()

# In-memory storage for groups
groups = []

# Dependency to get the current group by UID
def get_group(uid: int) -> Optional[GroupReadDTO]:
    for group in groups:
        if group.uid == uid:
            return group
    return None

# Dependency to get the current group by UID for write operations
def get_group_for_write(uid: int) -> Optional[GroupWriteDTO]:
    for group in groups:
        if group.uid == uid:
            return group
    return None

# Endpoint to create a new group
@app.post(""/groups/"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
async def create_group(group: GroupWriteDTO):
    group.uid = len(groups) + 1
    groups.append(group)
    return group

# Endpoint to get a group by UID

These differences can be influenced by various factors, including climate, availability of hosts, and local ecosystems. Here are some general observations:

1. **Climate and Seasonality**: In regions with distinct seasons, Tabanus species may have different flight patterns. For example, in temperate regions, they might be more active during the warmer months, while in tropical regions, they could be active year-round.

2. **Host Availability**: The abundance and distribution of hosts (such as horses, cattle, and other animals) can influence flight patterns. In areas with a high concentration of hosts, Tabanus may be more likely to fly in areas where these hosts are found.

3. **Elevation**: In mountainous regions, flight patterns can vary with elevation. Species may be more common at lower elevations where temperatures are warmer and hosts are more abundant.

4. **Habitat**: Different regions may have different habitats that influence flight patterns. For example, in forested areas, Tabanus might be more active in open areas where they can find hosts, while in grasslands, they might be more common near water sources.

5. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Some Tabanus species have evolved specific behaviors to cope with local conditions. For instance, some species might be more active during the day in some regions, while others might be more active at night in others.

6. **Migration Patterns**: Some Tabanus species may exhibit migration patterns, moving from one region to another based on seasonal changes or availability of hosts.

While these differences exist, it's important to note that more detailed studies and specific data are needed to fully understand the flight patterns of Tabanus in different regions. Research in entomology and ecology can provide more precise information on these behaviors."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.

Student:","3

The passage that can be used to answer the question by searching for further information is Passage 3. This passage mentions Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of King Charles I of Hungary, and provides context about the time period and events surrounding Andrew's reign. To determine how many kings Hungary had before Joanna I of Naples' father-in-law (King Charles I of Hungary), one would need to research the history of Hungarian kings leading up to Charles I."
