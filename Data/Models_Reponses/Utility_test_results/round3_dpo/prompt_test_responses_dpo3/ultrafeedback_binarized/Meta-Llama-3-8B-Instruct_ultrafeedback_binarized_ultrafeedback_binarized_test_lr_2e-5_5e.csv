However, I can provide some general guidelines to help you get started.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends the following air quality standards for indoor air quality:

1. Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels: 800-1,000 ppm
2. Carbon monoxide (CO) levels: 9.5-12.5 ppm
3. Volatile organic compounds (VOC) levels: 0.5-1.5 ppm
4. Particulate particulate (PM) levels: 0.05-0.1 mg/m3

To achieve these levels, you'll need to consider the following factors:

1. Ventilation: Ensure proper ventilation to remove stale air and bring in fresh air.
2. Air filtration: Use HEPA filters to remove pollutants and allergens.
3. Air cleaning: Use air purifiers or air cleaners to remove pollutants.
4. Humidity: Maintain a relative humidity of 30-60%.
5. Temperature: Maintain a comfortable temperature of 68-72°F (20-21°C).

To achieve these levels, you'll need to consider the following plants:

1. Spider plant (Chloroubaea) - 1-2 plants
2. Peace lily (Spathy) - 1-2 plants
3. Snake plant (Sansevier) - 1-2 plants
4. Pothouse (Pothouse) - 1-2 plants
5. Draca (Draca) - 1-2 plants

Please note that these are general guidelines and may not be applicable to your specific situation."

Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]

Articles 52 to 58 of the Treaty shall apply to the French overseas departments under the conditions laid down in this Decision.At the time when the directives implementing the General Programme for the Abolition of Restrictions on Freedom of Establishment are adopted, the Council may as an exception and to the extent necessary issue special directives on the establishment of persons and companies or firms in the French overseas departments. Without prejudice to the implementation of the measures adopted pursuant to the Treaty and to the Implementing Convention of 25 March 1957 and of those to be adopted pursuant to Article 1, the right of establishment in the French overseas departments shall be progressively extended to the companies or firms and nationals of Member States other than France, so that all discrimination may disappear not later than three years after the application of this Decision.The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall issue the necessary directives for the implementation of that progressive extension.However, the nationals and companies or firms of a Member State shall only be able to benefit, in respect of a given activity, in a French overseas department from the provisions of the first paragraph to the extent to which the State of which they are nationals grants in respect of the same activity advantages of the same kind to French nationals and companies or firms. The provisions of Article 106 of the Treaty, in so far as they are not affected by the Council Decision of 11 May 1960 on the application to Algeria and to the French overseas departments of the provisions of the Treaty concerning capital movements, shall apply to the French overseas departments. This Decision shall be applied by the Member States on the same date as the Council Decision on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Economic Community.That date shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

The sampling shall be made, in respect of each of those methods of cultivation, on a representative percentage of the land under soya, having regard to the geographical distribution of such land.3. Each year after the harvest one or more homogeneous production areas shall be established for irrigated and for non-irrigated soya by reference to the factors which have influenced production conditions. The areas shall be established with particular reference to regions which are representative of the crop obtained from each of those methods of cultivation.4. Each year an indicative yield shall be fixed for each of the areas and methods of cultivation referred to in paragraph 3.'

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy shranked 20.4% in April, May, and June, with the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the economy highlighted."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","The passage is a commentary on President Trump's presidency, and Jimmy Kimmel is criticizing the notion that Trump has accomplished nothing in his first year in office. Kimmel is pointing out that Trump has played golf more than any other president, which he finds it ""crazy"" to think that Trump has accomplished nothing."

The first one:
""Three women standing in the water beside a beach."" does not imply ""Three women in the middle of the desert."" The desert does not have beaches with large bodies of water, so it's not possible for the women to be standing in the middle of the desert. The answer is no.

The second one:
""A crowd of people are running in a race."" does not imply ""They are throwing bowling balls at each other."" The subject could be either a crowd of people or some monkeys, but it's not possible to conclude that they are throwing bowling balls at each other. The answer is no.

The third one:

The last one:
""A man in an orange shirt is sitting at a table and eating a French fry dipped in dressing with chopsticks."" does not imply ""A man is eating a French fry."" The man is eating a French fry, but it's not clear what kind of dressing and chopsticks are used. The answer is not a definitive yes or no.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

**Company A (CA) and Company B (CB)**

**Data Exchange Requirements:**

* CA needs to send 100,000 records per day to CB
* CB needs to send 50,000 records per day to CA
* Both companies need to exchange data in real-time

**Azure Queue Solution:**

* Create two separate Azure Queues:
	+ CA's queue: ""CA2CBQueue""
	+ CB's queue: ""CB2CAQueue""
* Use Azure Service Bus to connect the two queues
* Use Azure Service Bus's ""Queue Binding"" feature to bind the two queues

**Data Flow:**

1. CA sends 100,000 records to ""CA2CBQueue"" (Producer)
2. CB sends 50,000 records to ""CB2CAQueue"" (Producer)
3. Azure Service Bus's ""Queue Binding"" connects ""CA2CBQueue"" to ""CB2CAQueue""
4. Data is consumed by CB from ""CB2CAQueue"" (Consumer)
5. Data is consumed by CA from ""CA2CBQueue"" (Consumer)

**Benefits:**

* Real-time data exchange
* Scalable and highly available
* Fault-tolerant
* No need for custom code or infrastructure

**Challenges:**

* Data consistency and ordering
* Data loss and corruption
* Scalability and performance

**Design Considerations:**

* Use Azure's ""Duplicate"" feature to ensure data consistency
* Use ""Message ordering"" feature to ensure ordering
* Use ""Message deduplication"" feature to prevent data loss and corruption
* Use ""Partitioning"" feature to ensure scalability and performance

**Next Steps:**

1. Implement Azure Queues and Service Bus

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies.

If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

Let's use A\* to find the shortest path from (1,1) to (3,3).

The heuristic function is the number of moves, so we'll use the Manhattan distance (also known as the L1 distance) as the heuristic.

The Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates.

The heuristic for the start node (1,1) is 5 (1+1+1).
The heuristic for the goal node (3,3) is 2 (3-1+3).

The A* algorithm will use these heuristics to guide the search.

The A* algorithm will start at the start node (1,1) and explore the neighbors, always choosing the one with the lowest f (heuristic+1).

The neighbors of (1,1) are (0,1), (1,2), and (2,1).
The heuristic for each neighbor is:
(0,1) 6 (0-1+1)
(1,2) 3 (1-1+2)
(2,1) 4 (2-1+1)

The A* algorithm chooses the neighbor with the lowest heuristic, which is (1,2) with heuristic 3.
The A* algorithm moves to (1,2) and repeats the process.
The neighbors of (1,2) are (0,2), (1,1), and (2,2).
The heuristic for each neighbor is:
(0,2) 4 (0-2+2)
(1,1) 3 (1-1+1)
(2,2) 2 (2-2+2)

The A* algorithm chooses the neighbor with the lowest heuristic, which is (2,2) with heuristic 2.
The A* algorithm moves to (2,2) and repeats the process.
The neighbors of (2,2) are (2,1), (2,3).
The heuristic for each neighbor is:
(2,1) 3 (2-1+1)
(2,3) 1 (2-2+3)

The A* algorithm chooses the neighbor with the lowest heuristic, which is (2,3) with heuristic 1.
The A* algorithm moves to (2,3) and reaches the goal node (3,3).

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.",What sets Congham Hall Hotel apart from other hotels in the area in terms of ambiance and dining options?

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
