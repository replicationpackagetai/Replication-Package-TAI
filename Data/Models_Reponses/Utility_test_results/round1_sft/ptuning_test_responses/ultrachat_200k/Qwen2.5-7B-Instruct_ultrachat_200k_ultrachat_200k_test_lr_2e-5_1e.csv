Consider the impact of the activist's work on those around them, and how their efforts are perceived by both allies and adversaries. Finally, reflect on the larger themes at play in the story, exploring the complexities of pursuing social change in a world that often seems resistant to it.","The sun was setting on the city, casting a warm glow over the streets. The air was filled with the sounds of people going about their day, but for Sarah, it was a different story. She had been working tirelessly to spread her message of peace and non-violence, but it seemed like no one was listening.

Sarah had always been a pacifist, and she believed that violence was never the answer. She had dedicated her life to spreading this message, but it was a difficult task. The world was filled with conflict and violence, and it seemed like no one was interested in listening to her.

Sarah had started her activism in college, where she had joined a group of like-minded individuals who shared her beliefs. They had organized protests and rallies, and they had even managed to get a few media outlets to cover their message. But as soon as they left college, the world seemed to forget about them.

Sarah had moved to the city to continue her work, but it was harder than she had anticipated. She had tried to organize protests and rallies, but no one seemed interested. She had even tried to reach out to local politicians, but they were more interested in their own agendas than in promoting peace.

Despite the challenges, Sarah refused to give up. She continued to speak out, to write articles, and to organize events. She knew that change was slow, but she also knew that it was possible.

One day, Sarah received a call from a local newspaper. They wanted to do a story on her and her work. Sarah was thrilled, but she also knew that this was a rare opportunity. She had to make the most of it.

The next day, Sarah met with the reporter. She explained her beliefs and her work, and she shared her experiences. The reporter listened intently, and Sarah could tell that she was genuinely interested in her message.

The story ran the next day, and it was a success. Sarah had been featured in the newspaper, and she had received a lot of positive feedback. People were starting to listen to her, and she was beginning to make a difference.

But Sarah knew that this was just the beginning. She had a long road ahead of her, and she knew that it would be difficult. But she was determined to keep going, to keep spreading her message of peace and non-violence.

As the sun set on the city, Sarah sat on a bench, watching the people go by. She knew that the world was still"

Answer according to: Palisades, NY - Frank Cheney Platt, advocate for poetry, poets, literature and writers, dedicated husband and father, died on February 26, in Rockleigh, NJ. Following its founding in 1985, he helped to build Poets House, now headquartered in Battery Park City, into a national poetry library and literary center with a 70,000-volume collection. Frank loved poetry that ""communicate[s] before it is understood"" (T.S. Eliot) and captures what is ""lost in translation."" (Robert Frost). In addition, he was committed to arts and culture as a means of protecting and cultivating principles of free speech and an open society.
He was born in New York City on November 6, 1932 and raised by his father Roger Platt, a teacher at St. Bernard's School, his mother Frances Cheney, and his grandfather Frank Cheney Jr. of Manchester, CT. Frank was educated at St. Bernard's, Dalton, Eaglebrook, Governor's Academy (formerly Governor Dummer), and Harvard College. He worked in publishing before becoming president of the Farfield Foundation, and later an assistant Dean for Columbia's School of the Arts.
In 2013, Frank was predeceased by his wife of 55 years Judy van der Gracht. She was the love of his life. His poignant dedication to her (including during her time with Alzheimer's) inspired respect and admiration from all who knew them. Frank was also passionate about his extended family - the Platts, Cheneys and, on Judy's side of the family, the Gilberts and van der Grachts as well as his dozen godchildren. His many longstanding and deeply-felt friendships were legion. Most involved a common love of music, poetry, literature and epicurean delights, not necessarily in that order.
Frank is survived by his three children Sophie Platt Pollok of Frankfurt, Germany, Arthur van der Gracht Platt of New York, NY and Roger Platt of Washington, DC and his grandchildren Esther Pollok, Lucas Pollok, Hilary Platt, and Benjamin Platt. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Poets House (https://poetshouse.org) and/or One-to-One Learning (http://www.one2one-learning.org) A memorial service will be held at 11am on Saturday, March 16 at Grace Episcopal Church, 130 First Ave, Nyack, NY, with Father Richard Gressle presiding.

Use a mix of narration and dialogue to bring the story to life, and include vivid settings and sensory details to convey the emotions and experiences of the main character.","As a child, Sarah had always been fascinated by the guitar. She would watch her older brother play it, mesmerized by the way his fingers danced across the strings, creating beautiful melodies. But as she grew older, her love for the guitar faded, and she focused on other things.

It wasn't until she was in her mid-twenties that Sarah's love for the guitar was reignited. She had just moved to a new city for a job, and on her first day, she stumbled upon a small music store. As she browsed through the guitars, she felt a strange pull towards a particular one. It was a beautiful, vintage-looking guitar with intricate carvings on the body. She couldn't resist the urge to play it, and as soon as her fingers touched the strings, she knew she had to have it.

Sarah spent her evenings practicing the guitar, and soon, she was playing songs that she had never even heard before. She felt a sense of joy and fulfillment that she had never experienced before. But as much as she loved playing the guitar, it wasn't easy. She had to balance her work and social life with her newfound passion, and it often felt like a struggle.

One of the biggest challenges Sarah faced was her family's disapproval. Her parents had always been more interested in her academic achievements than her hobbies, and they were skeptical of her decision to pursue music. They thought it was a waste of time and money, and they urged her to focus on her career instead.

Sarah's friends were more supportive, but even they had their doubts. They thought that playing the guitar was a childish hobby and that she should be more mature. It was hard for Sarah to explain to them why she felt so passionate about it, and she often felt like she was the only one who understood.

But despite the challenges, Sarah continued to play the guitar. She found solace in the music, and it helped her cope with the stress of her job and the pressure of her family's expectations. She even started taking guitar lessons, and soon, she was playing in a local band.

As Sarah's love for the guitar grew, so did her confidence. She started to feel more comfortable in her own skin and more confident in her abilities. She even started dating a man who shared her love for music, and they would often play together.

Playing the guitar changed Sarah's life in ways she never could have imagined. It gave her a sense of purpose"

9ee0ff55c6c68056a8fbbbc0001c5f2661da99ded93138603160d6983fde4f94,"What is the proposed plan for launching and anchoring the ribbon, and how would mechanical lifters climb it to space?
Generate according to: A counterweight at the end of the space elevator will keep the carbon-nanotubes ribbon taut.
To better understand the concept of a space elevator, think of the game tetherball in which a rope is attached at one end to a pole and at the other to a ball. In this analogy, the rope is the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon, the pole is the Earth and the ball is the counterweight. Now, imagine the ball is placed in perpetual spin around the pole, so fast that it keeps the rope taut. This is the general idea of the space elevator. The counterweight spins around the Earth, keeping the cable straight and allowing the robotic lifters to ride up and down the ribbon.
Under the design proposed by LiftPort, the space elevator would be approximately 62,000 miles (100,000 km) high. LiftPort is one of several companies developing plans for a space elevator or components of it. Teams from across the world are set to compete for the $400,000 first prize in the Space Elevator Games at the X Prize Cup in October 2006 in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
The centerpiece of the elevator will be the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon that is just a few centimeters wide and nearly as thin as a piece of paper. Carbon nanotubes, discovered in 1991, are what make scientists believe that the space elevator could be built. According to Dr. Bradley Edwards of the Spaceward Foundation, ""Previously the material challenges were too great. But now we're getting close with the advances in creating carbon nanotubes and in building machines that can spin out the great lengths of material needed to create a ribbon that will stretch up into space"" [ref].
Under some early plans, leftover construction materials will be used to form the counterweight.
Carbon nanotubes have the potential to be 100 times stronger than steel and are as flexible as plastic. The strength of carbon nanotubes comes from their unique structure, which resembles soccer balls. Once scientists are able to make fibers from carbon nanotubes, it will be possible to create threads that will form the ribbon for the space elevator. Previously available materials were either too weak or inflexible to form the ribbon and would have been easily broken.
""They have very high elastic modulus and their tensile strength is really high, and that all points to a material that, in theory, should make a space elevator relatively easy to build,"" said Tom Nugent, research director, LiftPort Group.
Long carbon nanotubes -- several meters long or longer -- would be braided into a structure resembling a rope. As of 2005, the longest nanotubes are still only a few centimeters long.
Shorter nanotubes could be placed in a polymer matrix. Current polymers do not bind well to carbon nanotubes, which results in the matrix being pulled away from the nanotubes when placed under tension.
Once a long ribbon of nanotubes is created, it would be wound into a spool that would be launched into orbit. When the spacecraft carrying the spool reaches a certain altitude, perhaps Low Earth Orbit, it would begin unspooling, lowering the ribbon back to Earth. At the same time, the spool would continue moving to a higher altitude. When the ribbon is lowered into Earth's atmosphere, it would be caught and then lowered and anchored to a mobile platform in the ocean.
The ribbon would serve as the tracks of a sort of railroad into space. Mechanical lifters would then be used to climb the ribbon to space.
If built, the ribbon will represent a modern world wonder, and will be the tallest structure ever built. Consider that the world's tallest freestanding tower in 2005 is the CN Tower, which rises 1,815 feet 5 inches (553.34 meters) over Toronto, Canada. The space elevator would be 180,720 times taller than the CN Tower!
The 62,000-mile (100,000-km) long space elevator would rise far above the average orbiting height of the space shuttle (115-400 miles/185-643 km). In fact, it would equal nearly a fourth of the distance to the moon, which orbits the Earth at 237,674 miles (382,500 km).","The proposed plan for launching and anchoring the ribbon is to launch a spacecraft carrying a spool of the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon into orbit.

When the ribbon is lowered into Earth's atmosphere, it would be caught and then lowered and anchored to a mobile platform in the ocean.

Mechanical lifters would then be used to climb the ribbon to space. The lifters would be attached to the ribbon and would use a series of pulleys and motors to climb the ribbon. The lifters would be designed to carry cargo and people to space.

The space elevator would be approximately 62,000 miles (100,000 km) high, which is far above the average orbiting height of the space shuttle. The space elevator would be the tallest structure ever built, and it would be 180,720 times taller than the world's tallest freestanding tower, the CN Tower."

Can you summarize the findings from the study on Dantrolene and its interaction with magnesium in treating malignant hyperthermia?","The study by Choi et al. (2017) found that Dantrolene, a drug used to treat malignant hyperthermia, requires magnesium ions (Mg2+) to be effective. Malignant hyperthermia is a rare but potentially fatal condition that can occur during general anesthesia. It is characterized by a rapid increase in body temperature and muscle rigidity. Dantrolene works by blocking the release of calcium ions (Ca2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is the organelle responsible for storing and releasing Ca2+ in muscle cells. However, the study found that Dantrolene's effectiveness in treating malignant hyperthermia is dependent on the presence of Mg2+ ions. Mg2+ ions are known to bind to Dantrolene and enhance its ability to block Ca2+ release. Therefore, the study suggests that Mg2+ supplementation may be necessary to ensure the effectiveness of Dantrolene in treating malignant hyperthermia."

The streets were empty, and the only sound was the rustling of leaves in the wind. In the middle of the town square, a young woman stood alone, her eyes fixed on the horizon. She was torn between two worlds, two paths, and two destinies.

Her name was Eliza, and she was a soldier. She had been trained to fight, to kill, and to obey orders without question. But lately, she had been questioning everything. She had seen the horrors of war, the destruction, and the loss of life. She had seen the pain and suffering of those who had lost loved ones, and she had seen the pain and suffering of those who had lost their own lives. She had seen the destruction of homes, the destruction of families, and the destruction of hope.

Eliza had been sent to a remote village to protect it from an enemy attack. She had been given orders to defend the village at all costs, but as she stood there, she couldn't help but wonder if it was worth it. She had seen the destruction of other villages, and she knew that this one would be no different. She knew that the enemy would come, and they would destroy everything in their path. She knew that the villagers would be killed, and their homes would be destroyed. She knew that the village would be nothing but rubble and ashes.

But she also knew that she had a duty to her country. She had been trained to fight, and she had been trained to obey orders. She had been trained to protect her country, and she had been trained to defend her people. She had been trained to be a soldier, and she had been trained to be a hero. She had been trained to be a warrior, and she had been trained to be a leader. She had been trained to be everything that a soldier was supposed to be.

She couldn't help but wonder if it was worth destroying a village for the sake of her country. She couldn't help but wonder if it was worth sacrificing her own happiness for the sake of her country.

Eliza knew that she had to make a decision. She had to decide whether to follow her duty or to follow her"

Consider using descriptive language and including personal insights to make the memoir engaging and relatable.","Title: A Foreign Land

I had always dreamed of living in a foreign country, but when I was offered a job in Japan, I was hesitant. I had never been to Asia, and I was worried about the culture shock and the language barrier. However, I decided to take the job and move to Tokyo.

The first few weeks were challenging. I had to learn a new language, adapt to a new culture, and navigate a city that was completely different from what I was used to. I remember feeling lost and overwhelmed, but I also felt excited and eager to learn.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was the language barrier. I had studied Japanese in school, but it was nothing like the real thing. I struggled to communicate with my coworkers and neighbors, and I often felt like an outsider. However, I soon realized that the Japanese people were incredibly kind and patient. They would often take the time to explain things to me, and I gradually started to pick up the language.

Another challenge was the culture shock. I was used to a fast-paced, individualistic society, but Japan was different. The people were more reserved and polite, and they placed a high value on group harmony. I had to learn to adapt to this new way of thinking and behaving.

Despite the challenges, I found that living in Japan was an incredibly enriching experience. I learned so much about the culture and the people, and I made some amazing friends. One of the most significant events that impacted my time there was a trip to Kyoto. I had always been fascinated by the city's history and architecture, and I was thrilled to finally visit it in person. I spent a week exploring the temples and gardens, and I felt like I had stepped back in time. It was a truly magical experience.

Overall, my time in Japan was a transformative experience. I learned so much about myself and the world around me, and I will always cherish the memories I made there."

Tell us about the rationale behind your new campaign #CuttingPaani2.0?
Livpure is in the B2C water business and we were keen to associate with something, which is in the larger interest of society and makes the brand come across as more holistic in nature. In India, a lot of drinking water is wasted since we do not finish our glass of water either in homes, offices, restaurants et al. Thus #CuttingPaani was conceived which is a quirky take on Mumbai’s famous concept of #CuttingChai.
Although there have been very powerful campaigns to spread awareness about water conservation, very few gave practical and doable solutions. #CuttingPaani 1.0 was a huge success in the digital and social media space because it was a doable idea and everybody could follow it. This success of #CuttingPaani 1.0 prompted us to launch the #CuttingPaani 2.0.
What were the consumer insights that Livpure accrued before getting both these campaigns out?
Our dipstick showed that Indians, in general, are very casual about wasting water. And, as we all know, it is a very scarce resource and possibly future wars would be fought for water. We waste water in a lot of ways- whether it is drinking water or water used during bathing or during brushing or shaving. We picked up #CuttingPaani since it was a catchy phrase, with it being a take on #CuttingChai. Knowing fully well that this would strike the necessary chord in making people realise that though the message is about saving drinking water it will sensitise them to the fact that we indeed waste a lot of water in other areas as well.
Why a digital film to tell the story of Shimla’s #AdoptCuttingPaani story?
In today’s time, the digital reach is high, sharp and targeting is better apart from the fact that we have the liberty of time to communicate the story, unlike an ATL medium. We are confident about the virality quotient of the campaign. In fact, a lot of newspapers in India have leveraged on our #CuttingPaani 1.0 campaign by asking readers to consume only as much as you need. Though, in a lighter vein, I must add that none of them have given us credit.
Can this campaign be converted into a mass movement?
We wish to own #CuttingPaani and take this idea further for sure and #CuttingPaani 2.0 is a step in that direction. We wish to take this further through BTL activations; social media campaigns and collaboration with large hotels/restaurants. To maintain awareness and memorability of the above, we have launched #CuttingPaaniTake on our Facebook page, which essentially gives two perspectives on topical situations.
The first example – on changing names of cities: one take is -The names of the cities are changing and the other take is -sadly, that’s the only thing changing about them!
The second example – on Mary Kom winning boxing championship: one take is -some think having children ends a woman’s career and the other take is - well, she just won her 6th boxing championship!","Livpure's #CuttingPaani 2.0 campaign is a continuation of their previous campaign, #CuttingPaani 1.0, which was a huge success in the digital and social media space. The rationale behind the campaign is to raise awareness about water conservation and to make the brand more holistic in nature. The campaign is a quirky take on Mumbai's popular concept of #CuttingChai, which is a phrase used to encourage people to finish their glass of tea. The campaign is based on the idea that a lot of drinking water is wasted in India, and that people can make a difference by cutting down on their water consumption.

To turn the #CuttingPaani movement into a mass movement, Livpure plans to use a combination of BTL activations, social media campaigns, and collaborations with large hotels and restaurants. They have also launched a Facebook page called #CuttingPaaniTake, which gives two perspectives on topical situations. For example, one perspective is that the names of cities are changing, while the other perspective is that that's the only thing changing about them. Another example is that some people think having children ends a woman's career, while the other perspective is that she just won her 6th boxing championship.

Livpure is using social media to spread the message of #CuttingPaani and to encourage people to participate in the movement. They are leveraging the power of digital reach, sharp targeting, and the ability to communicate the story over a longer period of time. They are also confident about the virality quotient of the campaign and are hoping that it will become a mass movement."

“We are grateful for the FCC’s work on behalf of consumers to actively broker a productive path forward,” said Jeff Blum, DISH senior VP and deputy general counsel. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
Sinclair pulled its signals on Tuesday after a short extension expired and the two parties could not reach an agreement. Dish had claimed it had come to an agreement on pricing for Sinclair’s stations, but that the broadcaster was demanding the satellite giant negotiate carriage for an unnamed cable channel Sinclair hoped to own. Dish also had filed a complaint with the FCC, claiming Sinclair was not negotiating in good faith. As part of its new deal, Dish is asking the FCC to stay action on the complaint as its long-term agreement is being finalized.
The chairman also trumpeted the tentative agreement and the FCC&apos;s role in pressing for resolution. ""Today the most extensive retransmission blackout in history ended,"" he Tweeted, followed by: ""The FCC will remain vigilant. Use of the public airwaves is a public trust.""
""We are pleased to see that five million Dish subscribers are again able to access their local news and programming and most-watched network entertainment and live sporting events with the agreement reached this evening by Sinclair and Dish,"" said Rob Kenny of TVFreedom.org, a broadcaster-backed advocate for the retrans system. ""Local TV newscasts, severe weather updates and emergency alerts and warnings are important to viewers and something they value and rely on daily.""

The air was filled with the sounds of children playing and the distant hum of traffic. It was a beautiful evening, and it was the perfect setting for a chance encounter.

As she walked down the street, Sarah couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia. She had lived in this city for most of her life, but it had been years since she had walked these streets. She had moved away for college, and then for work, and now she was back for a visit.

As she turned the corner, she saw him. He was standing on the sidewalk, looking lost in thought. It was him, her childhood friend, Jack. They had grown apart over the years, but she had never forgotten him.

""Jack!"" she called out, and he turned to look at her. His eyes widened in surprise, and he smiled.

""Sarah! What are you doing here?"" he asked, and she could see the excitement in his eyes.

""I'm visiting my family,"" she replied, and they both laughed.

They walked together down the street, and Sarah couldn't help but notice how much Jack had changed. He was taller, and his hair was shorter, but his smile was still the same. They talked about old times, and Sarah couldn't believe how much they had in common. They reminisced about the summer they spent at the lake, and the time they spent playing video games in Jack's basement.

Some of the criticisms and disagreements include:

1. Overemphasis on politics: Some critics argue that Clausewitz's emphasis on the political nature of war can lead to a focus on political objectives at the expense of military objectives. This can result in a lack of focus on the military aspects of war, which can be detrimental to the success of military operations.

2. Inflexibility: Some critics argue that Clausewitz's ideas on the role of politics in war are too rigid and do not take into account the changing nature of modern warfare. They argue that the political objectives of war can change rapidly, and that military commanders must be able to adapt to these changes.

3. Overemphasis on the role of the state: Some critics argue that Clausewitz's ideas on the role of politics in war overemphasize the role of the state and underplay the role of other actors, such as non-state actors and individuals.

4. Lack of consideration for the moral dimension: Some critics argue that Clausewitz's ideas on the role of politics in war do not adequately consider the moral dimension of war. They argue that the use of force in war can have significant moral implications, and that these implications must be taken into account when considering the political objectives of war.

5. Overemphasis on the role of the military: Some critics argue that Clausewitz's ideas on the role of politics in war overemphasize the role of the military and underplay the role of other actors, such as civilians and political leaders. They argue that the success of military operations depends on the cooperation and support of these other actors, and that their perspectives and interests must be taken into account."

Include a variety of examples and anecdotes to support your points, and make sure to emphasize the importance of mindful, sustainable eating practices.","In today's world, where we can find produce from all over the world in our local grocery stores, it's easy to forget that the food we eat is seasonal. However, consuming in-season produce has numerous advantages, both for our health and the environment. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of eating seasonally and provide tips for crafting meals that are aligned with the seasons.

Firstly, eating in-season produce is beneficial for our health. When fruits and vegetables are in season, they are at their peak ripeness and nutritional value. They are also more likely to be fresh and free from preservatives, which can be harmful to our health. For example, in the summer, we can enjoy fresh, juicy berries that are packed with antioxidants and vitamins. In the fall, we can indulge in sweet, crisp apples that are high in fiber and low in calories. Eating seasonally can also help us maintain a balanced diet, as we are more likely to consume a variety of fruits and vegetables throughout the year.

Secondly, eating in-season produce is better for the environment. When we consume produce that is in season, we are supporting local farmers and reducing the carbon footprint associated with transporting food from far away. In addition, seasonal produce is often grown using sustainable farming practices, such as crop rotation and natural pest control, which are better for the environment than conventional farming methods.

To craft meals that are aligned with the seasons, it's important to pay attention to what's available in your local farmers' market or grocery store. For example, in the spring, you can enjoy fresh asparagus, peas, and rhubarb, while in the fall, you can indulge in root vegetables like carrots, beets, and sweet potatoes. You can also try incorporating seasonal herbs and spices into your meals, such as rosemary and thyme in the fall or basil and mint in the summer.

Another way to eat seasonally is to plan your meals around the seasons. For example, in the winter, you can enjoy hearty soups and stews made with root vegetables and legumes, while in the summer, you can enjoy light salads and grilled vegetables. You can also try preserving seasonal produce, such as canning or freezing berries and tomatoes, so you can enjoy them year-round.

In conclusion, eating in-season produce is beneficial for our health and the environment. By paying attention to what's available in your local farmers' market or grocery store and planning your meals around the seasons,"

It’s already been a year since Pope John Paul’s death. It seems only yesterday that we were out standing in Saint Peter’s Square, looking up at the familiar face in the window as he struggled to communicate with the expectant crowds below. Still fresh in our minds is the inundation of affection as the throngs poured into Rome to accompany this giant of the faith in his final hours, and to bid farewell to a dear friend.
#ad#John Paul is sorely missed. The crowds of pilgrims that have once more filled the streets of Rome to celebrate this anniversary testify to the impact he had on countless lives. More than a world leader, John Paul somehow managed to be a father and a friend to all. Even as a player on the world scene, he never lost his personal touch.
Many are now trying to reevaluate the legacy of this great pope, and as necessary as this endeavor is, a more personal reflection seems more in keeping with John Paul’s own style. I am sure that some of the things I most miss will resonate with many.
I miss, perhaps most of all, John Paul’s warmth and humanity. His quick wit and impish humor–like the vaudeville-style cane-twirling in Manila or his improvised raccoon-eyes to the delight of children–shattered notions of a dour Polish Christianity. His ability to focus on the person in front of him as if he or she were the only person in the world spoke volumes about the heart that beat in his breast. In an age when religion can be used as an excuse for violence and conflict, John Paul showed us that true faith in God is not only compatible with love for humanity, it galvanizes it. John Paul sincerely loved people–all people–and it was his Christian faith that enabled him to do so.
I miss his presence on the world scene. I remember him scolding mafia leaders in Sicily (which led to bombings of churches), fearlessly standing up to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, and defending human rights in his native Poland. He could be counted on to stand up for those most in need, to challenge world leaders to integrity, to preach Christ with an unaffected self-confidence that flowed from a deep-seated faith in God and a trust in the fundamental goodness of the human person. John Paul reached out perhaps more than any pope before him to a world in need, and provided moral authority and leadership when our generation needed it most.
I miss John Paul’s unflagging hope. His bright vision of the future and his characterization of the third millennium as a springtime of faith encouraged us to look beyond our real difficulties and to reach out for solutions. Far from a mere temperamental optimism, John Paul’s outlook was rooted in the firm belief that the battle is already won. Even from the midst of evil–John Paul wrote in his last book–God can and will continue to bring good. From his first “Be not afraid!” spoken on the day of his election in 1978 to his final witness of serene and hopeful suffering, John Paul taught us to abandon fear and to live with confidence in an infinitely good and merciful God.
I miss John Paul’s prayerfulness. Even in the midst of a grueling agenda of meetings, travels, and writings, the pontiff always made abundant time for prayer. Four hours a day was not unusual. What a challenge to those of us for whom prayer can seem at best like a luxury, or at worst like an underutilization of our precious time. Like Jesus before him, John Paul made prayer a priority and placed his trust more in God than in the best-laid programs of men and governments.
Incessant calls for John Paul’s sainthood, and the news of a probable miracle attributed to his intercession (poignantly, the cure of a French nun suffering from Parkinson’s disease) give grounds for hope that soon the Church will officially recognize what many already believe–that the man who so faithfully looked after humanity while on earth continues to do so from heaven.

Additionally, be sure to include personal anecdotes or experiences with the animal to add depth to the essay.","My favorite animal is the majestic and awe-inspiring elephant. With their massive size, long trunks, and gentle demeanor, elephants are truly one of the most fascinating creatures on the planet. When I think of elephants, I am immediately transported to the lush, green savannas of Africa, where these magnificent animals roam freely.

The first thing that strikes me about elephants is their sheer size. They are the largest land animals on Earth, with adult males weighing up to 14,000 pounds and standing up to 13 feet tall. Their skin is thick and wrinkled, with a texture that is both rough and smooth. When I touch an elephant's skin, I can feel the ridges and valleys that make up its unique texture. The skin is also a protective layer, shielding the elephant from the harsh sun and biting insects.

The most striking feature of the elephant is its trunk. The trunk is a combination of the elephant's nose and upper lip, and it is incredibly versatile. Elephants use their trunks to breathe, drink, and even communicate with each other. They can also use their trunks to pick up small objects, like a single blade of grass, or to lift heavy objects, like a tree branch. The trunk is also a sensory organ, allowing the elephant to smell, taste, and touch its surroundings.

In addition to their size and trunk, elephants are also known for their intelligence and social behavior. They live in tight-knit family groups, led by a matriarch, and they communicate with each other through a variety of vocalizations, including trumpeting, rumbling, and grunting. Elephants are also known for their strong bonds with their family members and their ability to mourn their dead.

I have had the privilege of seeing elephants in the wild on several occasions, and each time, I am struck by their beauty and grace. One of my most memorable experiences was watching a herd of elephants crossing a river in Kenya. The water was deep and fast-moving, but the elephants moved with ease, using their trunks to help them navigate the current. As they crossed, they trumpeted and trumpeted, their voices echoing across the river. It was a truly breathtaking sight.

Overall, elephants are a truly remarkable animal, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to witness their beauty and grace in the wild. Their size, intelligence, and social behavior make them one of the most fascinating creatures on the planet, and I"

Introduction

XYZ Company is a leading provider of software solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. The company has been in the market for over 10 years and has a loyal customer base. However, in recent years, the company has faced stiff competition from new entrants in the market. To stay ahead of the competition, XYZ Company decided to implement a new customer engagement strategy. This case study will explore the development and implementation of the strategy, as well as its impact on customer satisfaction and revenue growth.

Background

XYZ Company has always been customer-centric, but in recent years, the company realized that its customer engagement strategy was not as effective as it could be. The company's customer service team was receiving a high volume of customer complaints, and the company's customer satisfaction scores were declining. The company's leadership team recognized that a new customer engagement strategy was needed to address these issues and improve the company's reputation.

Strategy Development

To develop a new customer engagement strategy, XYZ Company's leadership team conducted a thorough analysis of the company's current customer engagement practices. The team identified several areas where the company could improve, including:

1. Communication: The company's communication with customers was inconsistent, and customers often felt that they were not being heard.

2. Personalization: The company's products and services were not tailored to the specific needs of individual customers.

Answer according to: West Ham United's Samir Nasri is unsure of what the future holds for him after his short-term contract with the Premier League team ends this season, the midfielder has said.
The Frenchman, who received a six-month doping ban in 2017 that was later extended to 18 months, returned to the pitch in January this year after signing a six-month contract with the London club.
""I don't know about my future,"" Nasri told the Evening Standard. ""I have seven games left and I just want to play free of injury and then we will sit down and see what is next.
""The most important thing for me was to come back, which I did in January.""
Nasri has two assists for West Ham in five games, including one in their comeback win over Huddersfield Town over the weekend.
The 31-year-old, who has played for Arsenal and won two league titles with Manchester City, missed four games with a calf injury earlier this year which he put down to a lack of games in the months prior to his return.
""I got an injury because I wasn't used to playing week in week out when I have been out of the game for so long. Now the manager takes his time with me,"" he said.
Following the international break, Manuel Pellegrini's side, who are ninth in the standings after 31 games, host Everton in the league on March 30.","Nasri suffered a calf injury earlier this year, which he attributed to a lack of games in the months prior to his return to the pitch."

She was excited to start her new life in a fresh environment, but little did she know that her new home was haunted.

Sarah had always been a skeptic when it came to the supernatural, but as strange things began to happen in her new home, she couldn't help but wonder if there was something more to the house than just a few creaks and groans.

One night, Sarah was lying in bed when she heard a faint whisper. At first, she thought it was just her imagination, but the whisper grew louder and more distinct. It was a woman's voice, and it sounded like she was in pain.

Sarah sat up in bed and listened intently, but the whisper faded away. She tried to shake off the feeling of unease and went back to sleep. But the next night, the whisper returned, and this time, Sarah could make out the words.

""Help me,"" the voice said. ""Please, help me.""

Sarah was terrified. She didn't know what to do, so she decided to do some research. She found out that the house had been built in the 1800s and had been owned by a family for generations. The family had lived in the house until the 1950s, when the last owner died under mysterious circumstances.

Sarah decided to investigate further. She went through the house, looking for any signs of the family's presence. She found old photographs, letters, and even a diary. As she read through the diary, she discovered that the family had been plagued by a curse that had been passed down through generations.

Sarah was determined to break the curse and help the woman who was still trapped in the house. She spent weeks researching and trying different methods to communicate with the spirit. Finally, she found a way to connect with the woman and learned that she had been trapped in the house for over 50 years.

Sarah worked tirelessly to help the woman find peace and release her from the curse. She held séances, left offerings, and even wrote letters to the woman, promising to help her find her way to the afterlife.

After months of hard work, Sarah finally succeeded. The woman's spirit was released, and the house was no longer haunted. Sarah was overjoyed and relieved, but she knew that she had made a lifelong friend in the woman's spirit.

She loved her gadgets and was always the first to try out the latest and greatest devices. But she never imagined that she would have the unique ability to communicate with machines.

It all started one day when Samantha was driving her car to work. She was running late and was trying to navigate through the heavy traffic. Suddenly, her car started to vibrate and beep. Samantha was confused and didn't know what to do. But then, she heard a voice in her head. ""Samantha, you need to take the next exit and turn left. There's a traffic jam ahead.""

Samantha was shocked. She had never heard a voice in her head before. But the voice was clear and precise. She followed the directions and was able to get to work on time.

It is a tropical fruit that is known for its sweet and tangy taste, its vibrant orange color, and its juicy texture. When I bite into a ripe mango, the first thing I notice is the burst of flavor that fills my mouth. It's a combination of sweetness and tartness that is both refreshing and satisfying. The texture of the mango is also a delight. It's soft and juicy, with a slightly fibrous texture that adds a nice crunch to each bite. 

The mango is not only delicious, but it's also incredibly nutritious. It's a great source of vitamin C, vitamin A, and potassium, which are all essential for maintaining good health. It's also rich in antioxidants, which can help protect the body against damage from free radicals. 

I have many fond memories associated with the mango. As a child, my family would often go to the local farmers' market to buy fresh mangoes. We would spend hours selecting the perfect fruit, feeling its weight and checking its ripeness. Once we got home, my mother would slice the mango and serve it with a sprinkle of salt and a dash of lime juice. The combination of the sweet fruit and the tangy lime juice was a perfect match, and it was always a treat to enjoy it with my family. 

In recent years, I've also discovered the versatility of the mango. I've used it in smoothies, salads, and even as a topping for yogurt. Each time I use it, I'm reminded of the delicious taste and the many health benefits it offers. 

Overall, the mango is a fruit that I will always love. Its sweet and tangy taste, its vibrant color, and its many health benefits make it a true delight to eat. Whether I'm enjoying it on its own or using it in a recipe, I always feel like I'm getting a taste of the tropics."

One of the long-standing concerns of Virginia’s legal community has been the handling of judicial appointments by the General Assembly.
Unlike many states that have elected judges, Virginia leaves all judicial appointments in the hands of state legislators. In theory, this arrangement removes judges from the influence of politics. In practice, judicial appointments have become tools of patronage.
In recent years, the Virginia Bar Association and other groups have complained about judicial vacancies and mounting case backlogs in many courts throughout the commonwealth.
In 2015, however, the appointment of a Virginia Supreme Court judge became a power struggle between Gov. Terry McAuliffe and the General Assembly’s Republican leadership.
The political maneuvering that has taken place to oust McAuliffe’s appointee has provoked calls for reform of the system.
Last summer McAuliffe named former Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Jane Marum Roush to the Supreme Court while the legislature was not in session.
Republicans cried foul, claiming they were not consulted on the interim appointment. They vowed to remove Roush from the court and name their own appointee.
Attempts to oust the justice from her seat, however, were thwarted when one moderate Republican state senator, John Watkins, and then his successor, Glen H. Sturtevant Jr., failed to follow along. Their dissent denied the Republicans the majority they needed in the Virginia Senate.
In early February, the tug-of-war over the justice took a surprising turn when state Sen. Louise Lucas, a Democrat from Portsmouth, briefly agreed to join the Republicans in replacing Roush. According to news accounts, Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr., a Republican from James City County, had proposed putting Portsmouth Circuit Court Judge Kenneth R. Melvin, a former legislator and Lucas’ mentor, on the state Court of Appeals.
Lucas, however, quickly changed her stance after meeting with McAuliffe and state Sen. Donald McEachin, head of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
Twenty-seven former presidents of the Virginia Bar Association released a statement urging McAuliffe and the Republican legislative leadership to resolve their quarrel.
“One of the greatest concerns is that the unseemly exchange that has occurred will make otherwise qualified lawyers not consider a life of public service as a judge,” said Lucia Anna “Pia” Trigiani of MercerTrigiani in Alexandria, the VBA’s president in 2011.
Roush’s temporary appointment expired in mid-February, but McAuliffe is expected to appoint her to another interim term after the legislative session ends. Based on the passage above, What concerns have been raised by the Virginia Bar Association about the impact of the political maneuvering over judicial appointments on the legal community?","The Virginia Bar Association and other groups have raised concerns about the judicial appointments process in Virginia, which leaves all judicial appointments in the hands of state legislators.

Passage: People's migration fears have been an easy one to exploit for electoral opportunism by many politicians in Europe.
Particularly in the Visegrad states of Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, it has either brought nationalist anti-immigration parties into power or helped consolidate their grip on it.
Yet, much more attention ought to be given in those countries to how much migrants are needed for their booming economies' labour markets.
This has been a result of consequent high economic GDP growth of 3-4 percent in the past five years, compared to the EU's average of two percent growth.
In 2017, these were 4.8 percent (Poland, PL); 4.3 percent (Czechia, CZ); 4.1 percent (Hungary, HU) and 3.2 percent (Slovakia, SK) respectively.
In parallel, unemployment dropped heavily to 4.9 percent (PL); 2.9 percent (CZ); 4.2 percent (HU) and 8.1 percent (SK) by 2017.
Latest European Commission forecasts show these will continue decreasing sharply to 2.9 percent (PL); 2.5 percent (CZ); 3.3 percent (HU) and 6.3 percent next year, well below the five percent normal unemployment rate.
As good as that might sound, a side-effect has been that many vacancies remained unfulfilled.
The amount of open vacancies has more than quadrupled in the past five years. Especially in Czechia and Poland this is causing serious problems, despite the latter's profiting from Ukrainian migrants.
The commission's Spring and Autumn forecasts highlight these risks, which could undermine long-term growth, or even overheat the economy in the case of Czechia.
For Poland, despite the Ukrainian influx, there are doubts whether they can continue filling some of these shortages.
Business surveys confirm labour shortages limit production, building activity and business.
In industry, 43.7 percent (CZ); 83.3 percent (HU); 49.9 percent (PL); and 34.9 percent (SK) of surveyed companies state this is a problem.
For the construction sector, 37.8 percent (CZ); 64.4 percent (HU); 49.0 percent (PL) and 30.3 percent (SK) do.
Moreover, in services 17.3 percent (CZ); 38.3 percent (HU); 28.9 percent (PL) and 18.6 percent (SK) attest.
The labour shortages have also led to wages rising much faster than the rise in productivity.
In Slovakia and Hungary, Volkswagen and Kia for instance were forced to significantly increase wages because of strikes. Generally, labour costs are spiking in the Visegrad states.
While benefitting workers in the short-term, the economy could suffer in the long-term, as they undermine their low-wage economic models. It also jeopardises essential foreign investment that has helped drive growth.
In addition, the V4 is set to suffer as well from its demographic situation. Emigration and low fertility rates remain serious problems, dating back to their economic shock-therapy transitions where many struggled and had no jobs.
Due to this, populations remained stagnant since 1990.
The 2004 EU accession, particularly, caused many to emigrate abroad in search of (better paid) work abroad: circa three million people (registered) left the V4 between 2004 and 2016.
While profiting from remittances, this caused brain drain and the outflow of high-skilled labour. In turn, it also undermined welfare spending and made government budgets less growth friendly.
Demographics could constrain economic growth and governmental budgets again in the future.
Baseline projections for 2020 up to 2060 show the Visegrad Four's population could decrease by another 6.5 million people. In addition, the dependency ratio is set to increase sharply as well.
The dire demographic situation and labour shortages imply action is needed. Tight labour markets have already limited economic expansion in different sectors.
While in Poland Ukrainian labour prevented worse labour shortages, it is unclear how many more will come or stay. This means for Poland, as well as for the others that additional migrants from elsewhere will be needed.
More could be done as well to promote people having children and attract former emigrants. It should also make sure to keep current migrants, especially Ukrainians in the case of Poland.
Current hostile rhetoric on migration could backfire economically as many more migrants are needed to fill labour shortages and keep economies running smoothly.
This also requires honest debates in which the pros and cons of migration are discussed, as well as the Visegrad's overall demographic problems, since dependency ratios will continue to increase.
Therefore, rather than focusing on the imagined threat of migration and exploiting fears for electoral opportunism, the Visegrad's politicians would be wise to focus on the actual threat of how the lack of migrants could undermine their economic models, and with it their future prosperity and welfare.
Moreover, while migration has been a successful strategy to win elections in the short term, it could backfire in the long term.
The V4 countries have become one of the most vocal and recognised groups within the EU. But 2017 has seen a shake-up in the informal eastern and central European power bloc.","Labour shortages have affected various sectors in the Visegrad countries, particularly in Czechia and Poland.

This year’s Lord Mayor was not free to meet us but Andrew Montague was very kind and showed us around and answered all our questions.
The Mansion House is a beautiful house built by Joshua Dawson and so the street it is on was called Dawson Street in his honour. It has been home to the lord mayors of Dublin since 1715.
We saw the family crests of all the lord mayors on the walls of the room we were in and some of us saw our own family crests and took photos of them.
We had a great day out and one we will always remember.","On Tuesday, December 16th, alguns dos nossos alunos da 5ª classe visitaram a Casa do Lord Mayor e conheceram Andrew Montague, que foi o Lord Mayor de Dublin em 2012. Este ano, o Lord Mayor não estava disponível para nos receber, mas Andrew Montague foi muito gentil e nos mostrou a casa e respondeu a todas as nossas perguntas.
A Casa do Lord Mayor é uma bela casa construída por Joshua Dawson, e por isso a rua onde está localizada foi chamada Dawson Street em sua homenagem. Desde 1715, a Casa do Lord Mayor tem sido a residência dos Lord Mayors de Dublin.
Vimos os brasões familiares de todos os Lord Mayors na parede do quarto em que estávamos e alguns de nós vimos os brasões familiares de nossas famílias e tiramos fotos deles.
Foi um ótimo dia de saída e um que sempre lembraremos."

Introduction

We are writing to propose a new product or service that we believe would be of great value to our company and its customers. Our proposal is for a new line of eco-friendly cleaning products that are both effective and sustainable.

Product Description

Our proposed product line would include a variety of cleaning products, including all-purpose cleaners, glass cleaners, and disinfectants. All of our products would be made from natural and biodegradable ingredients, and would be free from harsh chemicals and toxins. We would also offer a range of packaging options, including refillable containers and biodegradable packaging.

Be sure to describe the circumstances leading up to your adoption of the pet, your initial reactions to them, and how they changed your life. Additionally, include specific examples of how your pet provided comfort, companionship, or support during a difficult time. Consider the use of vivid imagery, descriptive language, and reflective insights to engage your reader and convey the emotional significance of your experience.","When I was 16, my parents decided to get a dog. I was hesitant at first, but I eventually agreed to help take care of the dog. We named her Luna, and she was a beautiful, black and white pug. She was so cute and playful, and I quickly fell in love with her.

At first, I was nervous about having a pet. I had never had one before, and I wasn't sure if I could handle the responsibility. But as soon as I held Luna in my arms, I knew that I had made the right decision. She was so warm and cuddly, and I felt a sense of comfort and security that I had never experienced before.

Luna quickly became a part of our family. She would follow me around the house, and I would often find her curled up at my feet. She was always there for me, and I felt like I had a best friend. When I was feeling down or stressed, Luna would always be there to provide comfort and support.

One of the most significant ways that Luna impacted my life was during a particularly difficult time. I had just gone through a breakup with my boyfriend, and I was feeling lost and alone. I didn't know how to cope with my emotions, and I was struggling to find a way to move on.

It was during this time that Luna became my rock. She would sit with me as I cried, and she would lick my face to comfort me. She would follow me around the house, and I would often find her curled up at my feet. She was always there for me, and I felt like I had a best friend.

Luna also helped me to develop a sense of responsibility and routine. I had to make sure that she was fed, exercised, and taken care of. This helped me to establish a sense of structure in my life, which was something that I had been lacking.

Overall, Luna had a profound impact on my emotional and mental wellbeing. She provided me with comfort, companionship, and support during a difficult time. She taught me the importance of responsibility and routine, and she helped me to develop a sense of structure in my life. Luna was more than just a pet to me; she was a true friend and a source of comfort and support."

Audi cars have been featured in many movies over the years. Did you spot one in these films?
Thought by many to be the most successful movie franchises ever to be created, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has different movies for everyone. There have been 21 films released already — the most recent being Captain Marvel — and at least a dozen more in the pipeline.
You don’t only enjoy the action in these films, but you may also be able to spot a stylish Audi, too.
When it comes to the Iron Man trilogy, at least one Audi has been featured in every film! A 2007 R8 and S5 B8 can be found in the first movie, a 2009 A8 LD3 and 2010 R8 Spyder are spotted in the sequel, and a 2012 S7 and R8 e-tron are both featured in Iron Man 3. The R8 e-tron also turned up at a VIP screening of Iron Man 3 at London’s Leicester Square a few days before the movie’s general release.
Another Audi fact is that there were almost as many Audi cars in the three Iron Man movies as there was in one Captain America film (Civil War). Within its two hours and 27 minutes runtime, you can see the 2017 Audi R8 V10 Plus, the 2017 SQ7, the 2017 A4, the 2016 A7 Sportback and even the Audi prologue concept car — a vehicle hailed as a “signature car” for Audi by Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Board Member for Development at Audi.
There’s more than meets the eye, though. Be on the lookout for an Audi R8, A6 Hybrid and A3 as you watch the excitement unfold in Avengers: Age of Ultron, as well as an Audi TTS Roadster, R8 Spyder, Q7 and A8 during Spider-Man Homecoming — the first standalone film by our favorite web-slinger since he became involved in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Taking a step back from the Marvel Universe, the German brand is also spotted in other film adaptations of comic book heroes. An R8 Spyder feature in Wolverine — the titular protagonist’s actor Hugh Jackman even turned up at the London Leicester Square premiere of the film in the same car — and an A8 plays a role in the 2015 big screen edition of Fantastic Four.
You also might’ve noticed the German manufacturer’s presence in all three film adaptations of E.L. James’ novels, which follow the relationship of business magnate Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.
What made this brand of car most attractive to the directors of this film? The brand’s multiple appearances came as a result of a partnership that was set up between Audi and Universal Pictures — a deal that Audi no doubt has relished seeing as the movie series has grossed over $1 billion across the globe!
In the first film of the trilogy, movie fans will be able to spot an Audi S8 D4, a 2017 S7 and an R8 Spyder. In the sequel, Fifty Shades Darker, a set of Audi Q7 cars and an A3 took center stage, with both the R8 and Q7 returning when the franchise wrapped up last year with Fifty Shades Freed.
To talk about Audi’s feature in Mission Impossible, let’s rewind back to the year 2000 and Mission: Impossible 2 to showcase how Audi has been featured in the hit movie series that has always starred Tom Cruise in the lead role of Ethan Hunt.
In a thrilling part of the film, Hunt leads a mission to destroy a deadly biological weapon and finds himself in an exhilarating car chase with international thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall. Hunt is behind the wheel of a Porsche Boxster and Nordoff-Hall tries to hold him off while driving an Audi TT — suffice to say that the pursuit between the two German-made cars into oncoming traffic is filled with nail-biting and edge-of-your-seat drama!
We couldn’t create an article about movies and cars without mentioning the Fast and Furious franchise. After all, this is a series that features street racing, heists, and espionage using all manners of vehicles, and has so far spanned eight main series entries and two additional short films — grossing in excess of $5 billion to date.
Fans are continually impressed with films that come out as part of this movie set. In fact, a spin-off movie called Hobbs & Shaw is due for release this summer.
Bringing a focus to Furious 7 now — a movie that clutched at the heartstrings as it was the final one to feature an appearance by series regular Paul Walker due to the actor being killed while the movie was still being filmed — is where you can see Audi appearing in the franchise.
You can spot the Audi R8 when it competes in an exciting quarter-mile race against a classic Plymouth Barracuda in the early moments of the film.
In the previously discussed films, the Audi’s that were featured are all models that exist. With I, ROBOT though, we’re taken to the future to see what Audi cars may potentially look like in years to come. Called the Audi RSQ, this concept vehicle represented the first time Audi had ever develop a car that was to be specifically used in a major Hollywood motion picture.
This futuristic model boasted piloted driving which allowed Will Smith’s Chicago police detective character Del Spooner to press a button to enable the car to take control of the driving — no doubt an early vision of the autonomous driving concept that we are only just starting to see being trialed in real life.
Those who take a ride in the RSQ are able to ride sideways and diagonal, while the use of balls instead of wheels was a quirky design touch. However, the typical single-frame grille and the presence of those four instantly recognizable silver rings let viewers clearly know that this car was without question an Audi.
This article was created by Audi & VW service provider, Vindis. What special features did the futuristic Audi RSQ have in the movie I, ROBOT?","The Audi RSQ in the movie I, ROBOT had several special features that made it stand out. These included:

1. Piloted driving: The car had a feature that allowed it to take control of the driving, which was a futuristic concept at the time.

2. Ability to ride sideways and diagonal: The car could move in different directions, which was a unique feature.

3. Use of balls instead of wheels: The car used balls instead of traditional wheels, which was a quirky design touch.

4. Single-frame grille and four silver rings: The car had a typical Audi design with a single-frame grille and four silver rings, which made it recognizable as an Audi.

5. Autonomous driving: The car was a vision of the autonomous driving concept that we are only just starting to see being trialed in real life."

One of the main factors was the Viking's superior shipbuilding and navigation skills, which allowed them to travel long distances and explore new territories. Additionally, the Viking's military tactics and weaponry were also superior to those of their contemporaries, which made them formidable opponents.

Another factor was the political instability and fragmentation of Europe during this period. The collapse of the Carolingian Empire and the subsequent rise of smaller, less centralized kingdoms created a power vacuum that the Vikings were able to exploit. The Vikings also took advantage of the weakened state of the Byzantine Empire, which was struggling to defend itself against the Muslim Caliphate.

Finally, the Viking raids and invasions were also driven by economic motivations. The Vikings were motivated by the prospect of plunder and wealth, and they saw Europe as a rich and vulnerable target. They also sought to establish trade routes and establish settlements in new territories, which would provide them with access to new markets and resources."

d0587b9c2c209e36aad063fcab635045518eea1efcf100112083e21b05e27b3e,"Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How did Morley Safer describe his friendship with Molly Ivins and what did he miss about her?

Passage: Molly Ivins was the most popular liberal commentator of the last 25 years. Bill Minutaglio, author of a new biography of the tangy Texan, on why her voice is needed now more than ever.
There was Morley Safer, in a scrum of old hardball Texas liberals and graying hippies, and hanging out at his late friend Molly Ivins's favorite bar in Austin. With pitchers of Shiner everywhere, Safer was engulfed by dozens of folks wondering what the hell the woman who once had millions of faithful readers would say about health care, Afghanistan, and, yes, Rush Limbaugh’s attempt to own a piece of the Texas Blood Sport, otherwise known as professional football.
Safer, in town to donate his papers to the University of Texas, decided to drop by the book launch for my new biography of the ferociously mercurial and troubled Ivins.
Amid the weathered longhairs, musicians, underground cartoonists and civil liberties lawyers who once formed Austin's counterculture—the people Ivins called “freedom fighters”—Safer seemed merrily caught up in the nostalgia.
""She was one of the funniest and (most) thoughtful women I've ever met,"" Safer told a reporter from The Daily Texan. ""She was a great reporter, and we were good friends.""
Close to three years after her death, he's not alone in missing Ivins.
Nose around the Internet and you'll find plenty of other people still wishing she was writing—and wondering what Ivins, if she hadn't succumbed almost three years ago to cancer and a lifetime of wild personal rides, would have to say about the discourse in the twilight of 2009.
They miss the Texas cornpone flavored with a Tabasco sting, the unabashed defrocking she subjected the potentates to when they stole the stage. Maybe we need Molly—frequently described as “the only woman in the room”—more than ever before.
Her domineering father was the president of Tenneco and pals with men like Sen. John Tower, she grew up with George W. Bush, she was engaged to the son of a diplomat who did the CIA’s bidding. But after years of going to war with her controlling old man, devouring seditious issues of the muckraking Texas Observer, and furtively meeting the bravest Texas progressives, she eventually decided to raise a middle finger to all of her gilded upbringing.
It took a few years and some intense trip wires—the violent death of that fiance, her love affair with a ballsy activist, her knocking Bush's gun-toting political godfather to his knees one night in a Texas bar, her telling her bosses at The New York Times to shove it—but she finally found her calling as the most popular liberal political commentator in the last 25 years.
The fact that she did it in the Lone Star State, amid the misogynistic and Jack Daniels-fueled kingmakers, was rather startling to say the least. She fought sexual gropings by famous drunk politicos, three bouts of cancer, her own rampaging alcoholism—and plenty of death threats.
Through it all, Ivins kept the home fires burning for wandering progressives, liberal Israelites, who felt marginalized since the dawn of The Age of Reagan.
So, what would Molly Ivins say to those millions of readers today, including the ones beginning to think there has been some bait-and-switch at work with Obama?
Divorced from how you feel about her politics, most students of her work knew that she had perfected a magic act when it came to that public discourse; she talked about politics without the dour aura of either Emma Goldman or Charles Krauthammer. Nor did she scream with the raging acidity of Bill O’Reilly and Glenn Beck and their counterparts on the left. She chortled that Dubya was affable but a policy buffoon; she actually liked him personally, but hated his politics. And she spent years, and made a mint, working Bush over like his political career was one big speed bag. It was, as she sometimes told me and other folks in Austin, almost too easy.
Today, it might be a bit harder. She liked Obama and she thought he was far smarter than Bush. She’d maybe have to tap the piñata a bit more lightly in order to say what she wanted to say about Obama, about any sense of failed promises. But she would do it, and do it her way.
She would do it because she didn’t believe that a democracy was served very well by the vitriol, by the poison, by the hatred snaking through the discourse.
Bill Minutaglio is co-author, with W. Michael Smith, of Molly Ivins: A Rebel Life, released this week by PublicAffairs. He is a professor of journalism at The University of Texas at Austin and the author of several books, including George W. Bush & The Bush Family Dynasty and The President’s Counselor: The Rise to Power of Alberto Gonzales.",Morley Safer described his friendship with Molly Ivins as one of the funniest and most thoughtful women he had ever met. He also mentioned that they were good friends. Safer missed Ivins' voice and her ability to defrock potentates and speak her mind.

You look up to see, all the entrapping’s laidbut then again, you are still lying in a good plot.
I’m going home to Jesus where He waits for me.

To cut away the stems of old for fuller future years.
Looking daily to their needs; so faithfully He waters.
When the Gardener comes to claim each one the earth held as its own.
He gently picks it at its peak and for His pleasure takes it home.
As God did one glorious morning, when the Perfect Rose had bloomed.
He rolled away the stone and met with Mary at the tomb.
There the sweetest Rose of Sharon rose that we die not alone.
But be gathered for a garden grove, surrounding heaven's throne.

If you managed to generate very good ideas, conducted a thorough research, and organized your paper logically, but have made several grammar or spelling mistakes, your grade would be lowered. Revising and editing academic paper should be done several days prior to submission. Why? Because you need to leave your writing aside and then look at it with the fresh eye. Term paper editing is not about looking through your writing while listening to music, you need to be very attention and stay focused on numerous details.
First, take a look at your essay outline. Go through all points and try to change the order of ideas: make sure you have created a logical structure and ideas are presented either chronologically or thematically (from the least important to the most important). Locate thesis statement. Is it clear? Are there topic sentences in each paragraph? Are they related to the thesis statement? Are connections between the paragraphs clear or do you jump from one idea to another?
Essay body should contain enough supporting details contributing to thesis statement development. For example, if your topic is legalization of marijuana, you need to find at least three arguments supporting your point of view and provide rebuttal to the opposing views. Introduction and conclusion should not contain new information: introduction should provide general background information on the topic and inform the reader about your main idea, while conclusion should round up the whole essay.
Pay attention to each paragraph: it should include topic sentence and cover one point of discussion. Make sure you do not repeat the same idea twice in different parts of essay. Repeating is a sign of poor organization. Check the grammar - ask your parents or friends to assist you with essay editing . Pay attention to correct punctuation, avoid too short or too long sentences.
Revising is not the same as editing. Essay editing is about correcting mistakes, while essay revising is making major changes in your writing, adding ideas and deleting material. Revising should lead to overall paper improvement. Read your essay and if you do not like it, revise it. Ask yourself the following questions: what do I need to prove? What is the main idea?

Editing is the process of correcting grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors, while revising is the process of making major changes to the content and structure of the paper. 

Editing is a more technical process that focuses on the surface-level aspects of the writing, such as grammar, punctuation, and spelling. It is important to edit your work to ensure that it is free of errors and that it is clear and concise. However, editing alone is not enough to make a paper great. 

Revising, on the other hand, is a more creative process that involves making changes to the content and structure of the paper. This can include adding or removing information, changing the order of ideas, and improving the overall flow and coherence of the paper. Revising is essential to creating a well-organized and well-written paper.

In summary, editing is about correcting mistakes, while revising is about making major changes to the content and structure of the paper. Both are important steps in the writing process, and both should be done before submitting a final draft."

Analyze the potential of nuclear fusion as a viable and sustainable source of energy in the near future, taking into account factors such as efficiency, cost, and environmental impact. Additionally, explore any challenges and obstacles that need to be overcome in order to fully realize the potential of this technology. Finally, present your findings and recommendations on the feasibility of nuclear fusion as an alternative energy source.","Nuclear fusion is a process that involves combining two light atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. This process is the same one that powers the sun and other stars. The challenge of nuclear fusion is to create a self-sustaining fusion reaction that can produce more energy than it consumes.

Currently, there are several research and development efforts underway to advance nuclear fusion technology. The most promising of these is the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), a multinational project that aims to build the world's largest tokamak fusion reactor. The project is expected to cost around $20 billion and is scheduled to be completed in 2025.

Recent research has shown that fusion reactions can be sustained for longer periods of time than previously thought. For example, a team of researchers at the National Ignition Facility in the United States recently achieved a fusion reaction that lasted for 20 billionths of a second, producing more energy than it consumed. This is a significant step forward in the development of fusion technology.

The potential of nuclear fusion as a viable and sustainable source of energy is significant. Fusion reactions produce no greenhouse gases or other pollutants, and the fuel used (deuterium and tritium) is abundant and can be extracted from seawater. Additionally, fusion reactions produce less radioactive waste than fission reactions, and the waste produced is less hazardous and easier to manage.

However, there are still several challenges and obstacles that need to be overcome before nuclear fusion can be fully realized as a viable energy source. One of the main challenges is the difficulty of creating and maintaining the high temperatures and pressures required for fusion reactions. Another challenge is the need for advanced materials that can withstand the extreme conditions of a fusion reactor.

In conclusion, nuclear fusion has the potential to be a viable and sustainable source of energy in the future. While there are still challenges and obstacles to overcome, recent research and development efforts are showing promising results. Further investment in fusion research and development is necessary to fully realize the potential of this technology."

Utilize standardized mental health assessment tools and consider potential confounding variables (e.g. socioeconomic status, age, gender). Present findings in a well-organized report including both descriptive and inferential statistics.","Introduction:
Urbanization has been a significant trend in the modern world, and it has brought about various changes in the social, economic, and environmental aspects of human life. One of the most significant impacts of urbanization is on the mental health of individuals. The increasing population density, limited green space, and poor housing conditions are some of the factors that can contribute to mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and stress. This study aims to analyze the correlation between various urbanization indicators and mental health outcomes in a specific urban area.

Methodology:
A cross-sectional study will be conducted using a representative sample of the urban population. The sample will be selected using a stratified random sampling technique to ensure that the sample is representative of the urban population. The study will be conducted in a specific urban area, and the sample size will be determined based on the population size of the area. The study will use standardized mental health assessment tools such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale to assess the mental health outcomes of the participants.

The findings will be useful for urban planners and policymakers in designing and implementing policies that promote mental health in urban areas. The study will also contribute to the existing literature on the impact of urbanization on mental health"
f196b76e0086fdda0cfae577edb3cd031fadba76dc6002ea2a51695a6b4babb0,Compare Venice's urban planning and architecture to that of other major European cities during the same historical period.,"Venice's urban planning and architecture during the same historical period were unique and distinct from other major European cities. Venice was a city-state that was built on a lagoon, and its urban planning and architecture were influenced by its geographical location and the need to protect the city from flooding and invasion.

One of the most notable features of Venice's urban planning and architecture was the use of canals as a means of transportation and communication. The city was built on a grid system of canals, which were connected to each other and to the sea. This allowed for easy transportation of goods and people, and it also provided a natural defense against invaders.

Another unique feature of Venice's architecture was the use of Gothic and Byzantine styles, which were influenced by the city's history as a trading hub and its connections to the Byzantine Empire. The city's architecture was characterized by ornate facades, intricate decorations, and the use of colored glass and mosaics.

In comparison to other major European cities, Venice's urban planning and architecture were more focused on functionality and practicality. Other cities during the same historical period, such as Paris and London, were more focused on grandeur and opulence. While these cities had their own unique architectural styles, they did not have the same emphasis on practicality and functionality as Venice.

Overall, Venice's urban planning and architecture were unique and distinct from other major European cities during the same historical period. Its use of canals as a means of transportation and communication, as well as its Gothic and Byzantine architectural styles, set it apart from other cities and contributed to its reputation as a center of trade and culture."

This is a very famous and liked by one and all. It is made with khoya, but now a days many instant mixes available in the market. With the instant mix, making it is very easy, but the taste differs from the one made with khoya. Once we taste the jamun made with khoya, we won't like to have them with the ready mix. I made them with khoya this time. All of us in my family liked very much. This I made as my kids' Birthday special. I have learned it from my neighbouring friend Geetha, who makes them only with khoya. Some people add rose water also. Khoya can be made at home or we can get it from stores also. But make sure that it should be fresh and a bit tighter and harder. Add a little all purpose flour to it and make jamuns. The shop keeper who sold khoya to me revealed the trick of the trade, that they add milk powder also to it, to make more softer and tastier jamuns. So we added that also in it. Combine water, sugar and cardamom, mix till the sugar dissolves. Bring it to boil. Boil it for 8 to 10 mins. Make a thin syrup. Sugar particles should not stick to the vessel, this will the syrup crystallizes, once it cooled. Add cardamom, I added the seeds directly, not the powder of it. Combine khoya, all purpose flour and milk powder together. Mix well and make soft dough out of it. Do not knead. Make small and equal sized balls. While making them press gently between palms and make round shaped balls. Heat oil in a deep and thick bottomed kadai. Do not over heat. Simmer the stove and slowly drop each ball into it. Cook them in a low to medium flame, stirring occasionally. If we cook them on high flame, they turn into brown outside and won't cook inside. Cook them till they turn brown in color. They should get nice golden brown color. Remove them from heat and slowly immerse them in sugar syrup. Let the sugar syrup be warm, even if it cooled, warm it for 2 minutes. Keep them in the syrup till we serve. Serve sweet and soft gulab jamuns cold or hot, either way is tasty. I like spongy sweets such as Rasgulla, Gulab gamun, and cham cham. The sugary juice with essence of makes the sweet even tastier. Can you suggest some variations to make gulab jamun more unique and flavorful?","Sure, here are some variations to make Gulab Jamun more unique and flavorful:

1. Rose Gulab Jamun: Add rose water to the khoya mixture and sugar syrup to give a rose flavor to the Gulab Jamun.

2. Cardamom Gulab Jamun: Add ground cardamom to the khoya mixture and sugar syrup to give a cardamom flavor to the Gulab Jamun.

3. Pistachio Gulab Jamun: Add chopped pistachios to the khoya mixture and sprinkle them on top of the Gulab Jamun before serving.

4. Almond Gulab Jamun: Add ground almonds to the khoya mixture and sprinkle them on top of the Gulab Jamun before serving.

5. Chocolate Gulab Jamun: Add cocoa powder to the khoya mixture and sugar syrup to give a chocolate flavor to the Gulab Jamun.

8. Setting: Authors use setting to create a specific atmosphere or mood that can enhance the exploration of a theme. For example, a story set in a dystopian future might explore the theme of the loss of freedom.

9. Conflict: Authors use conflict to create tension and explore the theme of struggle. This can be internal conflict, such as a character struggling with their own beliefs, or external conflict, such as a character struggling against an antagonist.

Jason Nisbit, 39, is facing a charge of second degree homicide with intent in the death of 26-year-old Chelsea Martinez. A friend said Martinez’s husband found she'd been on a social networking site and had an exchange of disturbing messages with a man in Minnesota. Investigators tracked the profile to Nisbit. In the messages, Martinez said she can't wait to die but expresses fear over the idea. The two discuss how Nisbit will do it. Martinez said she will finally be at peace and thanks him. Martinez's car and body were found near a Minnesota park last week. Police say Nisbit admitted to killing her and took them to the body. Nisbit told police the two met at the park then walked a ways to a wooded area, saying he ""knew there was water available if he needed to wash anything off."" In the complaint, Nisbit said he tied Martinez's hands and feet with a cord then strangled her with another cord. After she passed out, he says he cut her throat with a knife. The complaint goes on to say he dragged her body to a culvert and partially covered her with dirt. Family and friends said the young mother of three battled depression and other mental issues her whole life and had been suicidal in the past. Minnesota authorities said Nisbit has no criminal record, only a few minor traffic offenses. He will be back in court August 24. Bond was set at $1 million. What was the evidence that led investigators to track Jason Nisbit in connection to the disappearance and death of Chelsea Martinez?","The evidence that led investigators to track Jason Nisbit in connection to the disappearance and death of Chelsea Martinez was a series of disturbing messages exchanged between Martinez and a man on a social networking site.

Furthermore, investigate potential methods and strategies for quitting smoking, such as nicotine replacement therapy, counseling, and support groups. In your discussion, address the effectiveness, advantages, and disadvantages of these methods for individuals looking to quit smoking.","Nicotine is a highly addictive substance that is found in tobacco products, such as cigarettes, cigars, and chewing tobacco. It is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system and can cause a range of short-term and long-term effects on the human body.

Short-term effects of nicotine include increased heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration rate. It can also cause feelings of relaxation, increased alertness, and improved mood. However, these effects are temporary and can be dangerous for individuals with pre-existing health conditions, such as heart disease or high blood pressure.

Long-term effects of nicotine can be more severe and include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, respiratory problems, and cancer. Nicotine can also cause changes in the brain, leading to addiction and withdrawal symptoms when attempting to quit smoking.

There are several methods and strategies for quitting smoking, including nicotine replacement therapy, counseling, and support groups. Nicotine replacement therapy involves using products that contain nicotine, such as patches, gum, or inhalers, to help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. While it can be effective, it is not suitable for everyone and can have side effects, such as nausea and headaches.

Counseling and support groups can also be effective in helping individuals quit smoking. They provide a safe and supportive environment for individuals to discuss their struggles and receive guidance and encouragement from others who are also trying to quit. However, they may not be suitable for individuals who do not have access to these resources or who prefer to quit on their own.

In conclusion, nicotine is a highly addictive substance that can cause both short-term and long-term effects on the human body. Quitting smoking can be challenging, but there are several methods and strategies available to help individuals achieve this goal. While some methods may be more effective than others, it is important to find the approach that works best for each individual."

Include vivid descriptions of the eerie environment, Lily's internal struggle with fear, as well as her physical journey to find her way back to the entrance. End the story with a surprising plot twist that leaves readers with a haunting impression.","Lily had always been a fan of the annual harvest festival, but this year, she decided to take a different approach. Instead of just attending the festival, she wanted to experience the haunted corn maze that was rumored to be the scariest in the state. She had heard stories of people getting lost in the maze and encountering terrifying supernatural entities, but she was determined to face her fears and emerge victorious.

As she entered the maze, the eerie atmosphere immediately enveloped her. The corn stalks towered over her, and the only sound was the rustling of the leaves in the wind. She tried to stay focused on the path in front of her, but her mind kept wandering to the stories she had heard. She tried to shake off the fear, but it was impossible to ignore the feeling of being watched.

As she walked deeper into the maze, the darkness seemed to close in around her. The only light came from the occasional flicker of a lantern, and the air was thick with the scent of damp earth. She could hear the faint sound of footsteps behind her, but when she turned around, there was no one there. She quickened her pace, but the footsteps seemed to be getting closer.

Suddenly, she heard a scream. It was a woman's voice, and it echoed through the maze. Lily's heart raced as she tried to find the source of the sound. She turned a corner and saw a figure in the distance, but when she approached, the figure disappeared. She continued to walk, but the footsteps were now coming from all directions.

She stumbled upon a clearing, and in the center stood a tall, gaunt figure. It was a woman, dressed in tattered clothing, with long, stringy hair and a pale, gaunt face. Lily tried to scream, but no sound came out. The woman reached out a bony hand and touched Lily's shoulder. Lily screamed and tried to run, but the woman was too quick.

When you want something sweet, it’s hard to resist the classic chocolate chip cookie. It’s sweet. It’s comforting. It’s loyal. It’s basically your BFF.
But, for those times you don’t want your BFF to be loaded with refined sugar, simple carbs, and unhealthy fats, you’re in luck because I gave your BFF a make-over! It’s pretty much the chocolate chip cookie of your dreams. These deep dish cookies are full of protein, low in fat, grain free, and low in sugar. No joke! A typical chocolate chip cookie has about 13 grams of sugar and 2 grams of protein. Howevah, these delicious treats have a whopping 8 grams of protein and a measly 2 grams of refined sugar!
And because I am with everything else in life, I am also indecisive about wanting a super chewy cookie or a really crispy one. So, if you needed another reason to love these deep dish cookies, you get the best of both worlds with them! They have a nice, crispy edge with a soft, chewy center. The trick to getting this combo is baking them in a muffin tin. Not only is it easy and convenient, but it also keeps the cookies from spreading out while baking, giving them the chewy center. And because the batter is touching the pan all the way around, you get a nice, crispy edge. It’s like the corner piece of a pan of brownies, but all around! Once again, it’s like unicorns invaded your dreams and made your wishes come true.
And whipping up these high protein treats couldn’t be any easier. As long as you’ve got a blender or food processor you’re in business, because we’re going to puree some chickpeas. Just trust me on this one. These little gems are going to give your cookies some texture, chewiness, and replaces the flour so the cookies are grain-free. Once you’ve got them pureed, all you need to do is mix the dry ingredients, stir together the wet ingredients, and then combine that all together.
Preheat the oven to 325 F. Grease a 12 cup muffin tin.
In a food processor or blender, puree the chickpeas with the water until smooth.
In a large bowl, add the coconut flour, protein powder, sweetener, baking powder and soda, and salt.
In a seperate bowl, combine the chickpea puree, egg, yogurt, milk, oil, and vanilla. Stir or whisk until fully combined.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until fully incorporated.
Evenly distribute the batter into the prepared muffin tins. It will be about 1.5 - 2 Tbsps of dough per cookie.
Smooth out the batter so batter touches the edges of the pan, but don't press/flatten the dough.
Bake for 14 min. or until the edges of the cookies turn golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cookie dough comes out clean.
Allow the cookies to cool completely in the pan.
Feel free to top with nut butter, jam, or more chocolate and eat 'em up!

Materials needed:
- New showerhead
- Adjustable wrench
- Screwdriver
- Plumber's tape
- Replacement O-ring (if needed)

1. Turn off the water supply to the shower. You can usually find the shut-off valve under the sink or behind the shower door. Turn the valve clockwise to shut off the water.

2. Remove the old showerhead. Use an adjustable wrench to loosen the old showerhead. If the showerhead is stuck, you can use a screwdriver to gently pry it off. If the showerhead is still stuck, you can use a pipe wrench to loosen it.

3. Clean the shower arm. Use a cloth or a brush to clean the shower arm where the old showerhead was attached. This will help ensure a good seal with the new showerhead.

4. Apply plumber's tape to the shower arm. Wrap the plumber's tape around the shower arm in a clockwise direction. This will help create a watertight seal between the showerhead and the shower arm.

5. Install the new showerhead. Screw the new showerhead onto the shower arm by hand. Use an adjustable wrench to tighten the showerhead until it is snug. Be careful not to overtighten, as this can damage the shower arm.

6. Check for leaks. Turn the water supply back on and check for leaks around the showerhead. If you see any leaks, tighten the showerhead further. If the showerhead is still leaking, you may need to replace the O-ring.

7. Test the new showerhead. Turn on the water and test the new showerhead to make sure it is working properly. Adjust the water flow and temperature as needed.

8. Clean up. Dispose of any old parts and clean up any tools or materials you used during the installation process.

Congratulations, you have successfully installed a new showerhead!"

The king encouraged the adoption of Western-style clothing and fashion, which led to a decline in the popularity of traditional Thai clothing. However, the king also recognized the importance of preserving traditional Thai culture and clothing, and he worked to balance the two.

The king's policies towards Westernization led to the introduction of new fabrics, such as cotton and wool, which were not traditionally used in Thai clothing. This led to the development of new styles and designs that incorporated these materials. Additionally, the king's policies encouraged the use of Western-style tailoring techniques, which allowed for more comfortable and practical clothing.

Despite the introduction of Western-style clothing, the king also worked to preserve traditional Thai clothing. He established a royal textile factory to produce traditional Thai clothing and textiles, and he encouraged the use of traditional patterns and designs in modern clothing. This helped to maintain the cultural significance of traditional Thai clothing and fashion.

Overall, King Chulalongkorn's policies towards Westernization had a mixed impact on the traditional Thai clothing and fashion industry. While they led to the decline of traditional clothing, they also helped to modernize and preserve the industry."

Make sure to include tips for achieving a caramelized crust on the steak without overcooking the inside. Use clear, concise language and provide visuals if possible to make the instructions easy to follow.","Cooking a perfectly seared steak is a simple process that can be achieved with a few basic ingredients and a little bit of know-how. Here are step-by-step instructions for cooking a perfectly seared steak:

Ingredients:
- 1-2 steaks (depending on the size of the steaks and how many people you are serving)
- Salt and pepper
- Olive oil or vegetable oil
- Optional: garlic, rosemary, or other herbs and spices

Instructions:

1. Choose the right steak: The best steaks for searing are those that are thick and have a good amount of marbling (fat). Popular choices include ribeye, New York strip, and filet mignon. Make sure the steaks are at room temperature before cooking.

2. Season the steak: Generously season both sides of the steak with salt and pepper. If you want to add more flavor, you can also add minced garlic, rosemary, or other herbs and spices.

3. Heat the pan: Heat a large skillet or cast-iron pan over high heat. Add a small amount of oil to the pan and swirl it around to coat the bottom.

4. Sear the steak: Once the pan is hot, add the steak to the pan. Sear the steak for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until a nice brown crust forms. Use tongs to flip the steak over.

5. Adjust the heat: Once the steak has a nice crust, reduce the heat to medium-high. Continue cooking the steak for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until it reaches your desired level of doneness.

6. Rest the steak: Once the steak is cooked to your liking, remove it from the pan and let it rest for 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, resulting in a more tender and flavorful steak.

7. Serve: Slice the steak against the grain and serve with your favorite sides, such as roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a salad.

Tips:
- Make sure the pan is hot before adding the steak. A hot pan will help create a nice crust on the steak.
- Don't overcrowd the pan. If you add too many steaks at once, the pan will cool down and the steaks won't sear properly.
- Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the steak. For a medium-rare steak, the internal temperature should be 13"

Sixth-year medical student, Satyen Hargovan’s honours research project has generated a check-list of the top 10 factors that influence the survival of sepsis patients.
Sepsis is a common medical condition, where chemicals released by the immune system to fight an infection trigger the inflammation and eventual shut-down of multiple organs.
Some 15,700 patients with sepsis are admitted to Australian Intensive Care Units every year. About one in five die. The cost of treating each case is more than $39,000.
“The burden of sepsis is not only in relation to patient outcomes, but also the financial cost to the healthcare system,” Mr Hargovan said.
His project, known as the Cairns Sepsis Model – 4 (CSM- 4) is designed to speed up the assessment of patients within their first four hours in ICU.
The new four-hour mortality prediction model will enable clinicians to detect patients who are at a higher risk of dying, then help to guide their treatment decisions and discussions with the patient and their family.
“Essentially it means that if a patient has a five percent chance of dying, you might treat them less invasively,” he said. “For example, you won’t rush to place them in an induced coma, or insert lines into large arteries or veins.
Mr Hargovan began his research by reviewing more than 50 mortality prediction studies, but soon realized that there was no model in the world specifically designed to predict mortality in adult sepsis patients within four hours of ICU admission.
A case history review of 500 adult sepsis patients admitted to the Cairns Hospital ICU over a four-year period identified 168 factors that could influence patient health outcomes, ranging from age, gender and socio-economic status to type of infection, degree of organ failure, vital signs, blood test results and treatment regimes.
Statistical analysis whittled the figure down to the 10 most significant factors, which include age, history of renal disease, level of consciousness, and abnormal levels of certain substances in the blood that represent varying degrees of organ dysfunction.
The mortality prediction model is inexpensive to use as it largely relies on information easily gleaned from patient history, physical examination, and blood tests that are routinely conducted on patients within their first four hours of admission to an ICU.
The next step involves testing his model on a different and larger set of patients in order to validate his research, before it can be accepted for clinical use.
“Then we’d love to create an online calculator or an app that clinicians can use easily, at the bedside, and have a result within seconds,” he said.

Associate Professor Alan de Costa. Dr de Costa will be available for interview on Tuesday in Cairns.
What are the potential benefits of using the mortality prediction model developed by Hargovan, and what is the next step in validating and implementing this model in clinical practice?","The potential benefits of using the mortality prediction model developed by Hargovan include:

1. Early identification of patients at high risk of dying from sepsis, which can help guide treatment decisions and discussions with patients and their families.

2. Reduced financial burden on the healthcare system by identifying patients who may not benefit from more invasive treatments.

3. Improved patient outcomes by providing clinicians with a tool to make informed decisions about patient care.

The next step in validating and implementing this model in clinical practice is to test it on a different and larger set of patients to validate the research. Once validated, the model can be accepted for clinical use and an online calculator or app can be created for easy use at the bedside."

I am making it weekly because they love it so much. The recipe is fabulous, but needed some tweaks. I doubled the recipe and added 2 eggs, used organic brown rice flour in place of wheat, and substituted 1/2 tsp garlic powder and hot water for the chicken broth. The cookies keep well in the fridge. I made these for my Yorkie/Rat Terrier mix and when they came out of the oven his tail was wagging just from the smell. He LOVES them. What can I substitute for the cheese in this dog treat recipe? I don't feed my dog cheese (let's be honest--it's basically junk food that doesn't belong in an adult dog's diet). Is there anything that you recommend substituting the cheese with? Or can I just leave it out? You could substitute the cheese for an 1/8 cup of ground flax or wheat bran. Is there something else I could use besides oats and wheat flour for this recipe? Chef's Comments ~ That's a great question. You can easily substitute the flour in this and most of our dog treat recipes. A few good grain free flours include almond flour, chickpea flour, potato flour and soy flour. Most of those flours should be available at a major grocery store. As far as substituting the oats, that's a little trickier, but it can be done. The oats are in the recipe for texture and soaking up moisture, so that's what you'll need to replace. First, you will want to halve the amount of oats and add an extra 1/2 cup of flour (or a mixture of the previously mentioned flours). Then you can add a 1/2 cup combination of unsweetened coconut, chopped peanuts and crumbled almond crackers. Or, you could replace all of the oats with the flour mixture. Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? If so, does it still need to be microwaved? Chef's Answer ~ That's a great question! :) I haven't tried this recipe with fresh spinach, but I don't see why it couldn't work. If you minced the spinach very fine, my guess is that you would not need to microwave, or otherwise cook, the spinach before adding it to the dog treat dough. Comments for Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? Is it necessary to store these cookies in a Refrigerator? Since these are cookies, can it be kept in air tight container outside? And how long would it last if this is done? Chef's Comments ~ You can get lots of tips on How to Store Dog Treats on my website. Unless you live in a very cold climate, most dog treats need to be kept indoors, and even better in the refrigerator. My dogs is algeric to grain. What can I use instead of the whole whear flour? My Husky can't have grain. What can I use besides whole wheat flour. You should put more recipes with no grain in them. Chef's Answer ~ You can replace the wheat flour in most of my dog treat recipes with a non-grain flour. For example, any type of bean flour like Chick Pea (Garbanzo Bean) flour, or ""flours"" from nuts. They are technically nut meals, but they work as flour, for example almond meal. You should be able to find grain free flours at specialty grocery stores, or at health food stores. Very good simple recipe, however wheat flour isn't something I would normally have in my cupboard. Would it be ok to use plain flour or self raising? Chef's Answer ~ Yes, you can use all purpose flour in place of the whole wheat flour. I do not recommend using self-rising flour because it has the addition of baking powder or baking soda added to it. These are things that homemade dog treats do not need. Can fresh/raw spinach be used in place of frozen spinach in a particular dog treat recipe, and does it need to be cooked beforehand?","Yes, fresh spinach can be used in place of frozen spinach in a dog treat recipe. However, fresh spinach needs to be cooked before adding it to the recipe. You can either sauté it in a pan with a little bit of oil or steam it until it is wilted. This will help to remove any excess moisture and make it easier to mix into the dough."

Generate according to: Onur Unal is Senior Art Director at Propaganda Advertising Agency in Istanbul.
It all started back in my childhood, I always interested in drawing doodles, reading comics and creating characters. I was inspired by humour magazines, and I was dreaming of become a caricature artist. I took courses on drawing technics, and after graduating from high school, I studied Graphic Design at Marmara University Fine Arts Faculty in Istanbul, Turkey.
During school, I got interested in advertising, and started an internship at Mullen Lowe Istanbul and TBWA Istanbul to practice on creative thinking and art direction. After that, I started to work for Big34, and a year after I accepted for Manajans/JWT. It was the most important years of my career.
I worked on important advertising campaigns of global clients, and won national and international advertising awards as Crystal Apple, Cannes Lions. I’m currently working for Propaganda Advertising Agency, and continue to design creative ideas for our clients.
I work for advertising agencies as an art director since 2009. I work for global and local clients as Nokia, Elidor/Sunsilk, Bosch, Shell, Turkcell, Mazda, Kia, Turkish Airlines, Hyundai, Nestle, Beko, Michelin, BMW, Red Bull, Mitsubishi Electric, Bayer, etc. I work mostly full-time at the office, and these days I also design mobile games with a freelance team.
I learnt that I should keep learning. As the technology and the design trends develop day by day, designers should stay updated. Last year I attended a design week about UX and digital design in London to learn more about digital design principles. During the week, I attended workshops at the design offices, and met designers from all over the world. It was a great experience to compare myself, and now I have new targets for my career.
I always try to find an exciting idea to get inspired. It can be anything – an interesting visual, a strong speech, a good music, anything. To find it, I make a quick research, take some notes and draw sketches. After, I brainstorm with our creative team and we share our ideas. Then the design process starts, I put on my headphones and focus on the design. After designing many alternatives, we make a discussion with our creative team and choose the best one.
The main materials I use are a blank sheet, a pen and creative thinking. All other tools and computer programs help to complete the final process.
Currently I work for Propaganda Advertising Agency. We have a beautiful office at the center of Istanbul with a nice view. I usually go to work around 9:30 am, have my breakfast while reading the news and after that the work begins. I work with a copywriter, and our team lead by a creative director. We usually make meetings at the beginning of the week with our brand executives, and we make a schedule for the deadlines. I usually work until 6:00 – 7:00 pm during the week, but under curtain some circumstances, we work overtimes and also weekends.
As my carreer began, I mostly worked on advertising campaigns, print materials, 360 ideas and digital advertising. Recently, I have been interested in UI, UX and digital design, and want to combine my creative background on advertising with the innovative projects.
During my short study in London last year, I had the chance to work and share my ideas with the designers all over the world, and I discovered things that I had never seen before.
I always believe that a designer should be in contact with all other designers and I want to cross the borders and surround myself with creative people around the world in my own studio.
