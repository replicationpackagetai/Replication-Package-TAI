Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. **Location and orientation**: Choose a location with good access to public transportation, schools, shops, and other essential services. Orient buildings to maximize natural light and passive solar heating and cooling.
2. **Building design and layout**: Design buildings with energy-efficient features, such as insulation, double-glazed windows, and solar panels. Optimize building layouts to reduce energy consumption, improve ventilation, and enhance natural light.
3. **Water conservation**: Incorporate water-saving measures, such as low-flow showerheads, toilets, and faucets. Implement rainwater harvesting systems to collect and reuse rainwater for irrigation, toilet flushing, and other non-potable purposes.
4. **Energy-efficient systems**: Install energy-efficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, as well as energy-efficient appliances and lighting.
5. **Renewable energy sources**: Incorporate on-site renewable energy sources, such as solar panels, wind turbines, or geothermal systems, to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
6. **Waste reduction and recycling**: Implement waste reduction and recycling programs, including composting, recycling, and minimizing waste sent to landfills.
7. **Green spaces and landscaping**: Incorporate green spaces, such as parks, gardens, and green roofs, to provide recreational areas, improve air quality, and mitigate the urban heat island effect.
8. **Community engagement and education**: Encourage community engagement and education on sustainable living practices, such as energy conservation, water conservation, and waste reduction.
9. **Innovative materials and technologies**: Incorporate innovative materials and technologies, such as recycled materials, low-VOC paints, and energy-efficient building systems, to reduce environmental impact.
10. **Phased development and adaptive reuse**: Plan for phased development and adaptive reuse of existing buildings to minimize waste, reduce environmental impact, and promote sustainable development.
11. **Incorporate green infrastructure**: Incorporate green infrastructure, such as green walls, green roofs, and permeable pavements, to manage stormwater runoff, improve air quality, and reduce the urban heat island effect.
12. **Incorporate smart home technologies**: Incorporate smart home technologies, such as smart thermostats, smart lighting, and smart appliances, to optimize energy"

When you run `docker-compose up`, you might encounter a 404 error if there's an issue with your Docker Compose configuration file (`docker-compose.yml`) or if the Docker daemon is not running.

Here are a few potential reasons why you might be getting a 404 error:

1. **Invalid Docker Compose configuration**: Double-check your `docker-compose.yml` file for any syntax errors or typos. Make sure you've defined the correct services, networks, and volumes.
2. **Missing Docker daemon**: Ensure that the Docker daemon is running on your system. You can check the status of the Docker daemon by running `systemctl status docker` (on Linux) or `service docker status` (on macOS).
3. **Incorrect Docker Compose version**: Verify that you're using the correct version of Docker Compose. You can check the version by running `docker-compose --version`.
4. **Network issues**: If you're running Docker Compose in a network environment, ensure that the network is properly configured and that you have the necessary permissions to access the Docker daemon.
5. **File system issues**: If you're using a file system like NFS or SMB, ensure that the file system is properly configured and that you have the necessary permissions to access the files.

To troubleshoot the issue, you can try the following:

1. Run `docker-compose config` to validate your Docker Compose configuration file.
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the containers in detached mode and check the logs for any errors.
3. Run `docker-compose logs` to view the logs of your containers.
4. Check the Docker daemon logs for any errors or issues.

If none of these suggestions help, please provide more details about your Docker Compose configuration file and the error message you're seeing, and I'll do my best to assist you further!"

The author's emotional state is one of frustration, desperation, and possibly even despair. The use of the metaphor of a ruined fort suggests that the author feels like they are in a state of disrepair, unable to access or control their own life or circumstances. The phrase ""inaċċessibli"" (inacessible) reinforces this idea, implying that the author feels trapped and unable to escape their current situation. The overall tone of the passage is one of desperation and frustration, with the author expressing a desire to break free from their current circumstances and find relief."

This code checks if the form has been submitted, and if so, it checks if the file is an image and if it is too large. If the file is valid, it moves the file to the upload directory and displays a success message. If the file is not valid, it displays an error message.

You can also use PHP's built-in `imagecreatefromstring()` function to validate the image and resize it if needed. Here is an example:
```
<?php

if ($_SERVER[""REQUEST_METHOD""] == ""POST"") {
  // Get the file name
  $filename = $_FILES[""image""][""name""];

  // Check if the file is an image

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]

I am having difficulties with the older students complaining about the younger students and being disrespectful towards them. What are some teaching strategies or activities that encourage team building and bonding between band students?,"Here are some strategies and activities that can help promote team building and bonding among band students:

1. Team-building exercises: Organize team-building exercises that require students to work together to achieve a common goal. Examples include scavenger hunts, escape rooms, or group challenges that require communication and collaboration.

2. Group performances: Encourage students to work together on group performances, such as a school concert or a community event. This can help them develop a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose.

3. Mentorship programs: Pair older students with younger students and have them work together on a project or performance. This can help the older students develop leadership skills and the younger students learn from their experience.

4. Social events: Organize social events, such as a band party or a potluck dinner, that allow students to bond outside of class.

5. Team-building games: Incorporate team-building games into your lessons, such as ""Human Knot"" or ""Blindfolded Trust Walk."" These games can help students develop trust and communication skills.

6. Service projects: Organize service projects that require students to work together to help the community. This can help them develop a sense of shared purpose and teamwork.

7. Leadership opportunities: Provide leadership opportunities for older students, such as leading a section or helping with rehearsals. This can help them develop leadership skills and feel more invested in the band.

8. Team-building activities: Incorporate team-building activities into your lessons, such as ""The Human Bingo"" or ""The Trust Fall."" These activities can help students develop trust and communication skills.

9. Group discussions: Encourage students to participate in group discussions about topics related to the band, such as music theory or performance techniques. This can help them develop communication skills and a sense of shared purpose.

10. Team-building challenges: Incorporate team-building challenges into your lessons, such as ""The Egg Drop"" or ""The Marshmallow Challenge."" These challenges can help students develop problem-solving skills and work together to achieve a common goal.

1. **Osteoporosis risk**: Having a very low body fat percentage can increase the risk of osteoporosis, as bone density is closely linked to body fat. Women with a body fat percentage below 16% may be at a higher risk of developing osteoporosis, particularly if they are also experiencing menopause.
2. **Hormonal imbalance**: Low body fat can disrupt hormone levels, including estrogen and testosterone. This hormonal imbalance can lead to a range of symptoms, including irregular periods, hot flashes, and mood changes.
3. **Menstrual irregularities**: Women with a very low body fat percentage may experience menstrual irregularities, including amenorrhea (the absence of periods) or oligomenorrhea (infrequent or light periods).
4. **Nutrient deficiencies**: A low body fat percentage can increase the risk of nutrient deficiencies, particularly vitamin D and calcium deficiencies, which can contribute to osteoporosis.
5. **Muscle loss**: Low body fat can also lead to muscle loss, particularly if the individual is not consuming enough protein or engaging in regular resistance training.
6. **Impact on overall health**: A very low body fat percentage can have a negative impact on overall health, including increased risk of infections, impaired immune function, and decreased bone density.

It's essential to note that a body fat percentage of 16% or lower is not necessarily a healthy or sustainable goal for most women. Aiming for a body fat percentage within the normal range (18-24% for women) is generally recommended for overall health and well-being.

If you're concerned about your body fat percentage or experiencing any of the above symptoms, it's best to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian for personalized guidance and support."

20. What's is the sum of the squares of all factors of 210?","To solve this problem, we can start by factoring 210 into its prime factors: 210 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7. Then, we can list all the factors of 210: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 2 * 3, 2 * 5, 2 * 7, 3 * 5, 3 * 7, 5 * 7, 2 * 3 * 5, 2 * 3 * 7, 2 * 5 * 7, 3 * 5 * 7, 2 * 3 * 5 * 7.

Now, we can calculate the sum of the squares of all these factors:

1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + 2^2 * 3^2 + 2^2 * 5^2 + 2^2 * 7^2 + 3^2 * 5^2 + 3^2 * 7^2 + 5^2 * 7^2 + 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 + 2^2 * 3^2 * 7^2 + 2^2 * 5^2 * 7^2 + 3^2 * 5^2 * 7^2 + 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 * 7^2

• **Perfect Market**: A market where there are many buyers and sellers, and no single entity has the power to influence prices.
• **Healthcare Market Failure**: In the healthcare market, there are few buyers (patients) and many sellers (hospitals, doctors, insurance companies), giving the sellers significant power to influence prices.

• **Perfect Market**: A market where all buyers and sellers have perfect information about the market and the products being sold.
• **Healthcare Market Failure**: In the healthcare market, patients often lack information about the quality and cost of different treatments, making it difficult for them to make informed decisions.

• **Perfect Market**: A market where there are no barriers to entry or exit, allowing new businesses to enter the market and existing ones to leave.
• **Healthcare Market Failure**: In the healthcare market, there are significant barriers to entry, such as the need for expensive education and training, and the need for licensure and certification.

• **Perfect Market**: A market where all transactions are voluntary and mutually beneficial.
• **Healthcare Market Failure**: In the healthcare market, patients may not have the ability to choose their treatment options or providers, and may be forced to accept treatment options that are not in their best interest.

1. Open the `/etc/sudoers` file in a text editor using the command `sudo visudo`.
2. Add the following line at the end of the file, replacing `<username>` with the actual username you want to grant passwordless sudo access to:
```
<username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```
3. Save the changes and exit the text editor.
4. Reload the sudo configuration by running the command `sudo -k` (or `sudo -k <username>` if you want to test the passwordless sudo access for a specific user).
5. Now, when you run a command with the `sudo` prefix, you should not be prompted for a password.

Note: Make sure to only grant passwordless sudo access to trusted users, as this can be a security risk if not used carefully.

Alternatively, you can also use the `sudo -i` command to run a command with the `sudo` prefix without being prompted for a password. This is useful for running commands that require root privileges, such as installing software or configuring system settings.

For example, to install a package using `sudo` without being prompted for a password, you can run the command `sudo -i apt-get install <package_name>`."

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:",The UK economy shrank by 20.4% in the second quarter of 2020 due to the impact of the coronavirus lockdown.

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Here is a paraphrase of Kimmel's statement about Trump playing golf more than any other president and a connection to his critique of Trump's accomplishments:

Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that Donald Trump has played golf more than 70 times in his first year as president, a record that surpasses any other president. Kimmel used this fact to criticize Trump's accomplishments, suggesting that Trump's focus on golf rather than policy is a sign of his lack of commitment to the presidency. Kimmel also used this opportunity to promote the Affordable Care Act's open-enrollment period, encouraging viewers to sign up for health insurance despite Trump's efforts to undermine the plan. By highlighting Trump's golfing habits and the importance of healthcare, Kimmel is critiquing Trump's priorities and suggesting that he is not doing enough to address the needs of the American people."

Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone?

Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone?

As I step off the winding cobblestone streets and onto the soft, golden sand, the warm breeze carries the sweet scent of ripening grapes and the sound of gentle waves crashing against the shore. The picturesque whitewashed houses, adorned with bright blue domes and ornate balconies, seem to dance in the sunlight, their beauty and charm captivating my senses.

As I walk along the beach, the warm sand beneath my feet and the cool ocean breeze on my skin, I feel my worries and cares melting away. The sound of seagulls fills the air, their cries mingling with the gentle lapping of the waves against the shore. The smell of saltwater and seaweed wafts up, transporting me to a place of serenity and peace.

As I gaze out at the sparkling blue waters, I am struck by the sheer beauty of the surrounding landscape. The towering cliffs, covered in lush greenery and topped with ancient ruins, rise up from the shore, their rugged beauty a testament to the power of nature. The sun begins to set, casting a golden glow over the entire scene, and I am filled with a sense of awe and wonder.

As the stars begin to twinkle in the night sky, I find myself lost in the simple pleasures of life. The sound of the waves, the smell of the sea, and the warmth of the sun on my skin all combine to create a sense of contentment and happiness. Santorini, with its breathtaking beauty and tranquil atmosphere, is a place that fills my heart with joy and makes me feel truly alive."

**Overview**

In this design, we will use Azure Storage Queues to enable data exchange between two companies, Company A and Company B. The design will involve creating a queue in Azure Storage, and then using Azure Functions to read and write data to the queue.

**Components**

1. **Azure Storage Queue**: This is the central component of the design, where data will be stored and processed. The queue will be created in Azure Storage, and will be used to store messages that contain data to be exchanged between Company A and Company B.
2. **Azure Functions**: These are serverless functions that will be used to read and write data to the Azure Storage Queue. There will be two functions, one for Company A and one for Company B, that will be triggered by messages being added to the queue.
3. **Company A**: This is the company that will be sending data to the queue. They will use an Azure Function to send messages to the queue, which will contain the data to be exchanged.
4. **Company B**: This is the company that will be receiving data from the queue. They will use an Azure Function to read messages from the queue, and process the data.

**Design**

Here is a high-level overview of the design:

1. **Company A sends data to the queue**: Company A will use an Azure Function to send messages to the Azure Storage Queue. Each message will contain the data to be exchanged, along with any necessary metadata (e.g. the type of data, the format of the data, etc.).
2. **Azure Storage Queue stores messages**: The messages sent by Company A will be stored in the Azure Storage Queue. The queue will be designed to handle a high volume of messages, and will be able to store messages for a long period of time.
3. **Company B reads messages from the queue**: Company B will use an Azure Function to read messages from the Azure Storage Queue. The function will be triggered by the arrival of a new message in the queue, and will read the message from the queue.
4. **Company B processes data**: Once the message has been read from the queue, Company B will process the data contained in the message. This may involve converting the data from one format to another, or performing some other type of processing.
5. **Company B sends acknowledgement**: Once the data has been processed, Company"

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

The model should employ advanced natural language processing techniques, such as entity recognition and semantic analysis, to enhance its ability to detect subtle nuances in language and provide more accurate predictions. Additionally, the model should be trained on a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages to ensure its robustness and generalizability.","Here is a sentiment analysis model that can accurately differentiate positive and negative emotions expressed in textual content:

**Model Overview**

The proposed sentiment analysis model is a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques. The model consists of three main components:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: This component is responsible for cleaning and normalizing the input text data. It includes tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming or lemmatization, and removing special characters.
2. **Deep Learning Component**: This component is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. The CNN is used to extract local features from the text, while the RNN is used to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships between words.
3. **Traditional Machine Learning Component**: This component is based on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The SVM is used to classify the sentiment of the text based on the features extracted by the deep learning component.

**Training the Model**

The model is trained on a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages. The datasets include:

* **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews with corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative).
* **Amazon Product Reviews Dataset**: This dataset contains 10,000 product reviews with corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative).
* **Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset**: This dataset contains 10,000 tweets with corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative).
* **Google Opinion Rewards Dataset**: This dataset contains 10,000 survey responses with corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative).

The model is trained using the following steps:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: The input text data is preprocessed using the techniques mentioned above.
2. **Deep Learning Component**: The preprocessed text data is fed into the CNN-RNN architecture, which extracts local features and captures long-range dependencies.
3. **Traditional Machine Learning Component**: The features extracted by the deep learning component are used to train the SVM classifier.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on a test dataset to measure its performance.

**Model Evaluation Metrics**

The performance of the model is evaluated using the following metrics:

* **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances.
* **Precision**: The proportion of true positives among all positive predictions.
* **Recall**: The proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances.
* **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of"

console.log(encodedString); // Output: ""Hello%2C%20World%21""

var decodedString = decodeString(encodedString);
console.log(decodedString); // Output: ""Hello, World!""

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.

How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","Here's a step-by-step guide on how to make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, along with some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom:

1. Add all the ingredients except for soda water to a cocktail shaker. This includes gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water.
2. Shake the mixture for two minutes without ice. This step is crucial in creating the ideal foam and bloom on the drink. The egg white helps to create a silky, smooth texture, while the shaking process incorporates air and helps to create the desired foam.
3. Add ice to the shaker and shake until well-chilled or until the ice is melted. This step helps to chill the drink and incorporates the ice into the mixture.
4. Pour soda water into a Collins glass. This helps to create the desired fizz and helps to separate the foam from the liquid.
5. Strain the drink into the Collins glass over the soda water. This helps to create the desired foam and bloom on the drink.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it!

Some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the Ramos Gin Fizz include:

* Use a high-quality gin that has a good balance of flavors. This will help to create a smooth, silky texture in the drink.
* Use a fresh egg white. This will help to create a silky, smooth texture in the drink.
* Shake the mixture for the right amount of time. If you shake it for too long, the egg white will become too frothy and the drink will lose its silky texture.
* Use the right amount of soda water. If you use too much soda water, the drink will become too fizzy and the foam will not form properly.
* Strain the drink into the glass over the soda water. This helps to create the desired foam and bloom on the drink.

By following these steps and tips, you should be able to create a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz with the ideal foam and bloom."

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","The ambiance of Congham Hall Hotel is set apart from other hotels in the area by its tranquil and peaceful atmosphere, which is enhanced by its beautiful gardens and grounds. The hotel's interior design is also noteworthy, with its elegant and stylish decor, which includes a grand staircase, ornate fireplaces, and comfortable sitting rooms. The hotel's dining options are also a highlight, with its 2AA Rosettes restaurant serving a range of delicious dishes using locally sourced ingredients. The hotel's spa and wellness facilities are also a major draw, with its swimming pool, hot tub, and range of treatments and therapies. Overall, Congham Hall Hotel offers a unique and luxurious experience that is hard to find elsewhere."

Next, let's define the views for managing groups:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.requests import Request
from pydantic import BaseModel
from datetime import datetime

app = FastAPI()

# Read DTO
class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: int
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: datetime

# Write DTO
class GroupWriteDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str

# List all groups
@app.get(""/groups"", response_model=List[GroupReadDTO])
async def read_groups():
    # Implement logic to read all groups
    return []

# Read a group by UID
@app.get(""/groups/{uid}"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)

async def delete_group(uid: int):
    # Implement logic to delete a group
    return JSONResponse(status_code=200, content={""message"": ""Group deleted""})
```

This code defines a FastAPI application with views for reading, creating, updating, and deleting groups. The views use Pydantic to define the DTOs for reading and writing groups. The views also use FastAPI's built-in support for JSON responses and HTTP exceptions.

 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
