1. Energy Efficiency: Buildings can be designed to be more energy efficient by using insulation, energy-efficient appliances, and renewable energy sources such as solar panels.
2. Water Conservation: Developments can be designed to conserve water by using low-flow fixtures, rainwater harvesting systems, and drought-resistant landscaping.
3. Green Spaces: Developments can include green spaces such as parks, gardens, and green roofs to provide habitat for wildlife, improve air quality, and reduce heat island effect.
4. Sustainable Materials: Buildings can be constructed using sustainable materials such as recycled wood, bamboo, and straw bales.
5. Transportation: Developments can be designed to encourage the use of public transportation, walking, and biking by including bike lanes, pedestrian-friendly streets, and proximity to public transportation.
6. Waste Management: Developments can be designed to reduce waste by using composting, recycling, and minimizing packaging.
7. Community Engagement: Developments can be designed to engage the community in sustainable practices by providing education, incentives, and opportunities for participation.
8. Resilience: Developments can be designed to be more resilient to natural disasters by using sustainable materials, incorporating green infrastructure, and planning for future climate change.
9. Affordability: Developments can be designed to be more affordable by using prefabricated construction, modular design, and shared common spaces.
10. Health and Well-being: Developments can be designed to promote health and well-being by incorporating natural light, air quality, and green spaces.

These strategies can help to create more sustainable housing developments that are better for the environment, the community, and the residents."

Burning coal is one of the most wasteful energy processes.
 A: no","The question is: ""Burning coal is one of the most wasteful energy processes.""

The answer is: ""Yes, burning coal is one of the most wasteful energy processes because it releases a large amount of carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere, and it also requires a lot of energy to mine and transport the coal.""

The reasoning is:

1. Burning coal releases a large amount of carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere, which is harmful to the environment and contributes to climate change.
2. Burning coal also requires a lot of energy to mine and transport the coal, which is wasteful and inefficient.
3. Therefore, burning coal is one of the most wasteful energy processes.

The answer is supported by evidence and reasoning, and it is a clear and concise response to the question.

Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot the issue:

1. Check your Docker Compose file for syntax errors. You can do this by running the command `docker-compose config` in the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` file.

2. Ensure that the service you're trying to run is defined in the Docker Compose file.

3. Make sure that the service you're trying to run is up and running by running the command `docker-compose ps`.

4. If the service is running, try accessing it using the service name defined in the Docker Compose file, e.g., `http://my-service-name`.

5. If the service is not running, check the logs for any error messages by running the command `docker-compose logs -f my-service-name`.

6. If you're still encountering issues, try rebuilding the Docker images by running the command `docker-compose build`.

7. If the issue persists, consider checking the Docker Compose documentation for more information on troubleshooting common issues."

```php
<?php
if(isset($_POST['submit'])){
    $target_dir = ""uploads/"";
    $target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES[""fileToUpload""][""name""]);
    $imageFileType = strtolower(pathinfo($target_file,PATHINFO_EXTENSION));
    // Check if image file is a actual image or fake image
    $check = getimagesize($_FILES[""fileToUpload""][""tmp_name""]);
    if($check !== false) {
        move_uploaded_file($_FILES[""fileToUpload""][""tmp_name""], $target_file);
        echo ""The file "". htmlspecialchars( basename( $_FILES[""fileToUpload""][""name""])). "" has been uploaded."";
    } else {
        echo ""File is not an image."";
    }
}
?>
```

This code will allow you to upload an image to a directory called ""uploads"". You can change the target directory to whatever you want. The code also checks if the uploaded file is an actual image or not. If it is, it will be moved to the target directory and a success message will be displayed. If it's not, an error message will be displayed.

You can use this code in a form like this:

```html
<form action=""upload.php"" method=""post"" enctype=""multipart/form-data"">
    Select image to upload:
    <input type=""file"" name=""fileToUpload"" id=""fileToUpload"">
    <input type=""submit"" value=""Upload Image"" name=""submit"">
</form>
```

This form will allow you to select an image and upload it to the server. The form is set to use the POST method and the enctype is set to ""multipart/form-data"" to allow for file uploads."

Moreover, could you share a Ruby script capable of producing a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table?","To create a comprehensive comparison chart in HTML table format between traditional education and online education, we can use Ruby code to generate the table structure. Here's a simple example of how you can create a table using Ruby:

```ruby
require 'csv'

# Define the headers for the table
headers = [""Aspect"", ""Traditional Education"", ""Online Education""]

# Define the data for each aspect
data = [
  [""Cost"", ""High"", ""Low""],
  [""Flexibility"", ""Low"", ""High""],
  [""Interaction"", ""High"", ""Low""],
  [""Resources"", ""Limited"", ""Unlimited""],
  [""Learning Outcomes"", ""Mixed"", ""Mixed""]
]

# Write the table to a CSV file
CSV.open(""table.csv"", ""w"") do |csv|
  csv << headers
  data.each do |row|
    csv << row
  end
end

# Print the table as HTML
puts ""<table>\n""
puts headers.map { |header| ""<th>#{header}</th>"" }.join(""\n"")
puts data.map do |row|
  ""<tr>\n"" + row.map { |cell| ""<td>#{cell}</td>"" }.join(""\n"") + ""</tr>\n""
end.join(""\n"")
puts ""</table>\n""
```

This script generates a CSV file with the table data and prints the table as HTML. You can customize the headers and data to fit your specific comparison.

For the bar graph, you can use a Ruby gem like 'ruby-graphviz' to generate the graph. Here's a simple example of how you can create a bar graph using Ruby:

```ruby
require 'rubygem-graphviz'

# Define the data for the bar graph
data = [
  [""Cost"", 100],
  [""Flexibility"", 200],
  [""Interaction"", 50],
  [""Resources"", 300],
  [""Learning Outcomes"", 150]
]

# Define the graph
graph = Graphviz"

However, there is no built-in `ParentName` property. You can create a custom function to get the name of the parent table. Here's an example:

```lua
local parent = {}
local child = {parent = parent}

function parent:getName()
    return self.__metatable.__name
end

print(child:getName())
```

In this example, we create a `parent` table and a `child` table that has a `parent` property pointing to the `parent` table. We also define a `getName` function on the `parent` table that returns the name of the metatable.

You can use this function to get the name of the parent table of any table in Lua. However, this is a custom solution and may not work in all cases, especially if the parent table is not a simple table.

For more complex cases, you may need to use Lua's metatables and `__index` and `__newindex` metamethods to achieve the desired behavior."

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to augment your dataset, classify it using Keras, and ensemble other models for better performance.

1. Data Augmentation:

To augment your dataset, you can use techniques like rotation, zooming, and flipping. Here's a simple example using Keras's ImageDataGenerator class:

```python
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator, array_to_img
from keras.preprocessing import image
import numpy as np

# Load the dataset
train_data = np.load('train_data.npy')
train_labels = np.load('train_labels.npy')

# Define the data generator
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=20,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    shear_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=[0.2, 0.2],
    horizontal_flip=True,
    validation_split=0.2
)

# Create the batches
train_generator = datagen.flow_from_dataframe(
    dataframe=train_data,
    x_col='text',
    y_col='label',
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='categorical',
    target_size=(224, 224),
    shuffle=True
)
```

2. Model Training:

Now, let's train a simple Keras model using the augmented data. I'll use a simple CNN architecture for this example:

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Define the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(224, 224, 1)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""

For example, if you want to match a line that contains the string `foo=bar`, you can use the following regular expression:

```python
import re

line = ""foo=bar""
match = re.search(r'foo=bar', line)
if match:
    print(""Match found!"")
else:
    print(""No match found."")
```

In this example, the `=` symbol is not escaped, and it works as expected.

However, if you want to match a literal `=` symbol, you can escape it using a backslash (`\`). For example:

```python
import re

line = ""foo=bar""
match = re.search(r'\=', line)
if match:
    print(""Match found!"")
else:
    print(""No match found."")
```

In this example, the `=` symbol is escaped using a backslash, and it matches a literal `=` symbol.

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Trump has played golf more than any other president, and this is a presidential record.

Your task is to generate the fill-in-the-blank question for this answer based on the given article. The blanks are always at the end of the question, and can be filled with more than one word or phrase.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:
****
[A]: sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period


[Q]: Question: ""What do the factories need to keep their charters?""  Context: ""In the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of Machilipatnam on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted King James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.""  Answer:
****
[A]: high profits


[Q]: Question: ""Which disease does not cause more death than lower respiratory infections, TB or pertussis?""  Context: ""The top three single agent/disease killers are HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. While the number of deaths due to nearly every disease have decreased, deaths due to HIV/AIDS have increased fourfold. Childhood diseases include pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles and tetanus. Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory and diarrheal deaths. In 2012, approximately 3.1 million people have died due to lower respiratory infections, making it the number 4 leading cause of death in the world.""  Answer:

Climate change is causing rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and increased frequency of extreme weather events, which can lead to droughts, floods, and other disasters that can devastate ecosystems and threaten the survival of many species.

Climate change is caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, causing the Earth's temperature to rise.

Climate change is a global problem that requires a global solution. Governments, businesses, and individuals must work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources.

Climate change is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive approach. It is important to address the root causes of climate change, such as unsustainable economic systems and consumption patterns, and to work towards a more equitable and sustainable world.

In conclusion, climate change is the most important issue threatening all life on earth. It is a global problem that requires a global solution, and it is important to address the root causes of climate change and work towards a more equitable and sustainable world."

It is used to translate the design data generated by a CAD/CAM system into the specific language required by the machine tool controller to execute the part program.

The post processor takes the toolpath data generated by the CAM system and converts it into a format that can be read by the machine tool controller. This may involve adding or removing specific instructions, such as tool changes or feed rates, to ensure that the machine tool can execute the part program correctly.

The post processor is an essential part of the CAD/CAM process, as it allows the machine tool to read and execute the part program generated by the CAM system. Without a post processor, the machine tool would not be able to understand the instructions generated by the CAM system, and the part would not be able to be produced.

However, these reefs are under threat due to various factors such as climate change, pollution, overfishing, and coastal development. To preserve these reefs, several efforts are being made by governments, NGOs, and local communities. Some of the current efforts include:

1. Coral reef restoration projects: These projects involve the collection of coral fragments, their propagation in nurseries, and their transplantation to damaged reefs.
2. Marine protected areas (MPAs): MPAs are designated areas where fishing and other activities are restricted to protect marine ecosystems, including coral reefs.
3. Reducing pollution: Efforts are being made to reduce pollution from land-based sources, such as sewage and agricultural runoff, which can harm coral reefs.
4. Promoting sustainable fishing practices: Encouraging fishermen to use sustainable fishing methods, such as catch shares and gear modifications, can help reduce the impact on coral reefs.
5. Public awareness and education: Raising awareness about the importance of coral reefs and the threats they face can help promote their conservation.
6. Climate change mitigation: Efforts are being made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which can help mitigate the impacts of climate change on coral reefs.
7. Community-based conservation: Involving local communities in the conservation of coral reefs can help ensure their long-term protection.

These efforts are crucial for the preservation of coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea and for the protection of the marine biodiversity and the livelihoods of the people who depend on them."

Additionally, the model should be trained on a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages to ensure its robustness and generalizability.","Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a high-level overview of the steps we'll take to develop a sentiment analysis model:

1. Data collection: We'll gather a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages to ensure our model's robustness and generalizability.
2. Data preprocessing: We'll clean and preprocess the data to remove any irrelevant information and prepare it for training.
3. Feature engineering: We'll extract relevant features from the data, such as sentiment polarity, subjectivity, and emotion intensity, to improve the model's accuracy.
4. Model architecture: We'll design a deep learning architecture that can effectively capture the complex relationships between words and emotions in the data.
5. Training: We'll train the model on the preprocessed data using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
6. Evaluation: We'll evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set to ensure it's accurate and robust.
7. Deployment: We'll deploy the model as a sentiment analysis API that can be easily integrated into various applications.

To encode the string, you can use a technique called Base64 encoding. This is a common method for encoding binary data, such as images, into a string format that can be easily shared.

Here's an example of how you can encode a string using Base64 in JavaScript:

```javascript
const longString = ""Your long string here"";
const encodedString = btoa(longString);
console.log(encodedString);
```

To decode the string, you can use the `atob()` function:

```javascript
const decodedString = atob(encodedString);
console.log(decodedString);
```

This will give you the original string back.

You can also use libraries like `urlsafe-base64` to make the encoding and decoding process easier.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.

Who they are and why they are in conflict.,"Character 1: A young, ambitious, and idealistic scientist named Dr. Amelia. She is a brilliant researcher who has dedicated her life to finding a cure for a rare and deadly disease. She is passionate about her work and believes that her research could change the world.

Character 2: A wealthy and powerful businessman named Mr. Blackwood. He is a ruthless and cunning man who is more interested in making money than in helping people. He owns a pharmaceutical company that has been accused of unethical practices and price gouging.

The conflict between these two characters arises when Dr. Amelia discovers a potential cure for the deadly disease. However, Mr. Blackwood is determined to keep the cure a secret and profit from it. Dr. Amelia is torn between her desire to help people and her fear of Mr. Blackwood's power and influence.

The story could explore the moral and ethical dilemmas that Dr. Amelia faces as she struggles to find a way to bring the cure to the people who need it. It could also delve into the motivations and personalities of both characters, revealing their strengths and weaknesses and the complexities of their relationship.

The story could be set in a dystopian future where the pharmaceutical industry has become a corrupt and powerful force, and where the struggle for power and control is a constant battle. It could also be set in the present day, exploring the real-world issues of drug pricing and access to healthcare.

The story could be a thriller, with Dr. Amelia and Mr. Blackwood engaged in a cat-and-mouse game, each trying to outsmart the other. It could also be a character-driven drama, focusing on the emotional and psychological struggles of the characters as they navigate their conflict.

The story could have a satisfying and thought-provoking ending, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and inspiration, even in the face of corruption and greed. It could also leave the reader with a sense of unease and uncertainty, reflecting the complexities of the real world and the challenges that we face in our pursuit of a better future."

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.

DTO names must end with ""DTO"".
I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","Sure, here's an example of how you can structure your FastAPI API for managing groups of users:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from datetime import datetime

app = FastAPI()

class GroupCreateDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str

class GroupUpdateDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str

class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: int
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: datetime

class Group(BaseModel):
    uid: int
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: datetime

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True

groups = []

@app.post(""/groups/"", response_model=GroupCreateDTO)
async def create_group(group: GroupCreateDTO):
    group_obj = Group(**group.dict())
    groups.append(group_obj)
    return group_obj

@app.get(""/groups/"", response_model=List[GroupReadDTO])
async def get_groups():
    return groups

@app.put(""/groups/{group_id}"", response_model=GroupUpdateDTO)
async def update_group(group_id: int, group: GroupUpdateDTO):
    for index, group_obj in enumerate(groups):
        if group_obj.uid == group_id:
            groups[index] = Group(**group.dict(), uid=group_id)
            return group_obj
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=""Group not found"")

@app.delete(""/groups/{group_id}"")
async def delete_group(group_id: int):
    for index, group_obj in enumerate(groups):
        if group_obj.uid == group_id:
            groups.pop(index)
            return {""message"": ""Group deleted""}
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=""Group not found"")
```

This code creates a FastAPI API with end"

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
