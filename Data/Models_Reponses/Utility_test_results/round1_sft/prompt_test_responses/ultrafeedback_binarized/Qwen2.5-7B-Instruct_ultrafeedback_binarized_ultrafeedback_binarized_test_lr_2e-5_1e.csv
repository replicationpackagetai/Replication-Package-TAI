99293aca408ab3b84c32b7956526fd9962b7898b00626a170cb1389ca9fff2c7,why I get 404 error running docker-compose uo,"A 404 error typically indicates that the server cannot find the requested resource. When you encounter a 404 error while running `docker-compose up`, it's usually not directly related to the 404 error you see in a web browser, but rather it might indicate an issue with your Docker Compose setup or the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Check the `docker-compose.yml` File:**
   - Ensure that the service names and paths are correct.
   - Verify that the services are defined correctly and that there are no typos.

2. **Check the Logs:**
   - Run `docker-compose up --build` to rebuild the containers and then check the logs with `docker-compose logs` to see if there are any errors or issues.

3. **Verify the Service Configuration:**
   - Make sure that the service you are trying to access is running and exposed the correct ports.
   - For example, if you are trying to access a web service, ensure that it is running and listening on the correct port.

4. **Check the Network Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the services are properly connected in the Docker Compose network.
   - You can use `docker network ls` to list the networks and `docker inspect <network_name>` to get more details about the network configuration.

5. **Check the URL or Endpoint:**
   - Ensure that the URL or endpoint you are trying to access is correct.
   - For example, if you are trying to access a web service, make sure the URL is correct and the service is running on the expected port.

6. **Check for Missing Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that all dependencies required by the services are installed and available.

7. **Check the Docker Version:**
   - Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Docker and Docker Compose.

Here is an example of a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - ""80:80""
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html

This metaphor conveys the author's sense of isolation and desolation. The image of a ""ruined fort"" suggests a structure that has been damaged or abandoned, implying a feeling of decay or ruin. The word ""inaccessible"" further emphasizes the author's emotional state of being cut off from others or the world around them, possibly due to frustration, anger, or a sense of being misunderstood. Overall, the author seems to be expressing a deep sense of alienation and despair."

Here are some guidelines to help you determine the appropriate number of plants:

1. **Space Size**: A general rule of thumb is to have one large plant or three small plants for every 100 square feet (9.3 square meters) of space. If your closet office is smaller, you can use this as a starting point and adjust based on your specific needs.

2. **Types of Plants**: Some plants are more effective at removing certain pollutants. For example, NASA's Clean Air Study recommends plants like spider plants, snake plants, and peace lilies for improving indoor air quality. These plants are generally more efficient at purifying the air.

3. **Air Quality Issues**: If your closet office has specific air quality issues (e.g., high levels of formaldehyde, benzene, or other volatile organic compounds), you may need more plants or specific types of plants to address those particular pollutants.

4. **Lighting**: The amount of light available in your closet office can also affect the effectiveness of the plants. Plants that require more light may need to be placed in areas with better lighting to function optimally.

5. **Maintenance**: Consider how much time and effort you are willing to invest in maintaining the plants. Some plants require more care than others.

### Example Calculation
If your closet office is 100 square feet (9.3 square meters), you would need:
- 1 large plant or
- 3 small plants

If your closet office is smaller, say 50 square feet (4.6 square meters), you would need:
- 0.5 large plant (which you can round up to 1 large plant) or
- 1.5 small plants (which you can round up to 2 small plants)

### Recommended Plants
- **Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)**: Very effective at removing formaldehyde and xylene.
- **Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)**: Good for removing formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene.
- **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)**: Effective at removing formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene.
- **English Ivy (Hedera helix)**:"

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]

While body fat percentages can vary based on age, genetics, and overall health, a body fat percentage below 16% for women is generally considered very low and could potentially lead to health issues. Here are some potential consequences:

1. **Hormonal Imbalance**: Low body fat can disrupt hormonal balance, particularly affecting estrogen levels. This can lead to menstrual irregularities or amenorrhea (absence of menstruation).

2. **Reduced Muscle Mass**: Low body fat can also mean reduced muscle mass, which can affect overall strength and endurance.

3. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: A very low body fat percentage can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, as fat is necessary for the absorption of certain vitamins (like vitamins A, D, E, and K) and for storing energy.

4. **Weakened Immune System**: Fat tissue plays a role in immune function. A very low body fat percentage can weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections and illnesses.

5. **Bone Density Issues**: Fat tissue is important for maintaining bone density. Low body fat can lead to osteopenia or osteoporosis, increasing the risk of fractures.

6. **Metabolic Issues**: Very low body fat can affect metabolism, potentially leading to issues like hypothyroidism or other metabolic disorders.

7. **Psychological Impact**: Low body fat can also have psychological effects, such as increased stress, anxiety, and depression.

If a woman's body fat percentage is consistently below 16%, it is important to consult a healthcare provider to assess overall health and address any underlying issues. A balanced diet and regular exercise can help maintain a healthy body fat percentage."

However, in Roblox's Lua (often referred to as Luau), the syntax is slightly different.

In Roblox's Luau, you would use `v.Parent.Name` to access the `Name` property of the `Parent` of a variable `v`. Here's an example:

```lua
local v = script.Parent -- Assuming script is a part of a Roblox model
print(v.Parent.Name) -- This will print the name of the parent of v

However, it's important to use this feature with caution, as it can pose a security risk if not managed properly.

Here’s how you can set up passwordless `sudo` for a specific user or command:

### 1. **Using `visudo` to Edit the Sudoers File**

The `sudoers` file is where you configure which users or groups can run commands as other users. You should always use the `visudo` command to edit this file to ensure that the syntax is correct and to avoid locking yourself out of `sudo`.

```bash
sudo visudo
```

### 2. **Granting Passwordless Sudo for a Specific User**

To grant a specific user passwordless `sudo` access, you can add a line like this to the `sudoers` file:

```bash
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Replace `username` with the actual username you want to grant passwordless `sudo` access to.

### 3. **Granting Passwordless Sudo for a Specific Command**

If you want to grant passwordless `sudo` access for a specific command, you can do so like this:

```bash
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/command
```

Replace `username` with the actual username and `/path/to/command` with the full path to the command you want to allow.

### 4. **Example `sudoers` File Entry**

Here’s an example of what the `sudoers` file might look like after adding a passwordless `sudo` entry:

```bash
# Allow user 'john' to run all commands without a password
john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

### 5. **Testing the Configuration**

After making changes to the `sudoers` file, you should test the configuration to ensure that the changes are working as expected:

```bash
sudo -l -U john
```

This command will list the privileges that the user `john` has, including any passwordless `sudo` entries.

### 6. **Security Considerations**

- **Limit the Scope**: Only grant passwordless `sudo` access for commands or groups of commands that are absolutely necessary.
- **Monitor Usage**: Keep an eye on the usage of `sudo` to detect any"

Can you summarize Chip Livingston's poem ""The Jacaranda Blooms"" recorded for Poem-a-Day on January 21, 2016?","Certainly! Chip Livingston's poem ""The Jacaranda Blooms,"" recorded for Poem-a-Day on January 21, 2016, is a vivid and evocative piece that centers around the imagery of a blooming jacaranda tree. The poem begins by describing the vibrant and almost violent beauty of the jacaranda's purple petals, which are compared to weeping pollen. The speaker then calls out to someone, inviting them to come and see the tree, and mentions a ""bichofeo"" (likely a type of bird) singing about the subject with an open throat and beak.

The poem repeats the line ""A jacaranda blooms beside the drunk stick tree,"" emphasizing the presence of the tree and its significance. The speaker also imagines the jacaranda swelling with nectar and hearing it shriek, suggesting a sense of vitality and life force emanating from the tree. Overall, the poem captures the sensory and emotional impact of the blooming jacaranda, blending natural imagery with a call to witness and experience the beauty firsthand."

Lastly, submission with ['id', 'label]. Label consists 0 to 7, and the text column consists of news article data. Write some codes about augmentation, then, classifies via keras with other models ensembled. Validation must be f1 macro.","Sure, let's break down the task into several steps:

1. **Data Augmentation**: We can use techniques like text transformation (e.g., adding noise, synonyms, etc.) to augment the training data.
2. **Model Training**: We will train several models using Keras and ensemble their predictions.
3. **Validation**: We will use F1 macro score for validation.

Here's a step-by-step implementation:

### Step 1: Data Augmentation

We can use the `textattack` library for text augmentation. First, install it if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install textattack
```

Now, let's write the augmentation code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from textattack.augmentation import Augmenter

# Load the dataset
train_df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('test.csv')

# Define the augmentation strategy
augmenter = Augmenter(augmentation_techniques=['word_swap'])

# Apply augmentation to the training data
augmented_texts = []
for text in train_df['text']:
    augmented_texts.extend(augmenter.augment(text))

# Combine the original and augmented texts
train_df['augmented_text'] = augmented_texts
train_df['augmented_label'] = train_df['label'].repeat(len(augmenter.augment(train_df['text'][0])))

# Combine original and augmented data
train_df = pd.concat([train_df]*len(augmenter.augment(train_df['text'][0])), ignore_index=True)
```

### Step 2: Model Training and Ensemble

We will train several models and ensemble their predictions. Let's use Keras for this purpose.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense, Dropout
from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Tokenize and pad the text
tokenizer = Tokenizer()
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(train_df['augmented_text'])
train_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(train_df['augmented_text'])
test_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(test_df['text'])

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy contracted by 20.4% in April, May, and June due to the coronavirus lockdown, performing worse than other major industrial nations, with Scotland experiencing a slighter smaller decline of 19.4%."

For example:

- If you want to match the literal `=` symbol, you do not need to escape it:
  ```python
  import re

  pattern = r'='
  text = 'a=b'
  match = re.search(pattern, text)
  print(match)  # <re.Match object; span=(2, 3), match='='>
  ```

- If you want to match a literal `=` symbol within a larger pattern, you can do so without escaping it:
  ```python
  import re

  pattern = r'a=b'
  text = 'a=b'
  match = re.search(pattern, text)
  print(match)  # <re.Match object; span=(0, 3), match='a=b'>
  ```

- If you want to match a literal `=` symbol within a character class, you do not need to escape it:
  ```python
  import re

  pattern = r'[a=b]'
  text = 'a=b'
  match = re.search(pattern, text)
  print(match)  # <re.Match object; span=(0, 3), match='a=b'>
  ```

- If you want to match a literal `=` symbol within a pattern that includes other special regex characters, you do not need to escape it:
  ```python
  import re

  pattern = r'a.*b'
  text = 'a=b'
  match = re.search(pattern, text)
  print(match)  # <re.Match object; span=(0, 3), match='a=b'>
  ```

In summary, you only need to escape the `=` symbol if you want to match it in a context where it has a special meaning in regex (such as in a quantifier like `*`, `+`, `?`, etc.). In most cases, you can use `=` without escaping it."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that Donald Trump has broken a record by playing golf more than any other president in a single year—over 70 times. This statistic, while highlighting Trump's personal habits, also serves as a critique of his lack of significant accomplishments. Kimmel suggests that those who claim Trump hasn't done anything substantial should instead focus on positive actions, such as signing up for health insurance during the Affordable Care Act's open enrollment period. By mentioning Trump's golfing record, Kimmel indirectly emphasizes that the president has spent a considerable amount of time on leisure activities rather than on policy-making or other presidential duties."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

Nestled in a small, picturesque village surrounded by rolling hills and lush greenery, it is a place that feels like a sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of the city.

As soon as I step through the front door, I am enveloped in the warm, welcoming atmosphere of the house. The scent of freshly baked cookies and warm tea fills the air, and the sound of laughter and chatter from the living room draws me in. The house is filled with the memories of countless family gatherings, where we would sit around the fireplace, sharing stories and enjoying each other's company.

The living room is the heart of the house, with its cozy armchairs and plush couches arranged around a large, crackling fireplace. The walls are adorned with family photos and artwork, and the windows offer a breathtaking view of the surrounding countryside. It is a place where I feel at ease, where I can relax and let my guard down.

But what truly makes this place special is the people who inhabit it. My grandmother, with her kind eyes and warm smile, greets me with a big hug and a plate of freshly baked cookies. Her husband, my grandfather, is always there with a joke or a story to share. And my aunts and uncles, with their infectious laughter and lively personalities, make me feel like part of the family.

In the kitchen, my grandmother's hands move with practiced ease as she bakes cookies or prepares a delicious meal. Her recipes are passed down through generations, and each dish is a testament to her love and care. As we sit down to eat, we share stories and catch up on each other's lives, feeling grateful for the time we have together.

Outside, the garden is a riot of color and fragrance, with flowers blooming in every shade of the rainbow. The scent of lavender and roses fills the air, and the sound of birds chirping and bees buzzing creates a peaceful ambiance. I love to spend time in the garden, tending to the plants and enjoying the tranquility of the outdoors.

What makes this place truly special, however, is the sense of community and connection that it fosters. It is a place where family and friends come together to share in the joys and challenges of life. It is a place where I feel loved and supported, and where I am reminded of the importance of family and"

If you're not sure, I can still provide a detailed guide for one of the projects from your list. For instance, let's go with the ""Rust Web Crawler"" project. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started:

### Rust Web Crawler Project

#### Prerequisites
- Rust installed on your system (you can install it using `rustup`)
- Basic understanding of Rust syntax and concepts

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Project
1. **Create a new Rust project:**
   ```sh
   cargo new web_crawler
   cd web_crawler
   ```

2. **Add dependencies:**
   Edit `Cargo.toml` to include the necessary dependencies:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   reqwest = { version = ""0.11"", features = [""json""] }
   serde = { version = ""1.0"", features = [""derive""] }
   serde_json = ""1.0""
   ```

#### Step 2: Write the Crawler
1. **Define a `Page` struct to store the content of a web page:**
   ```rust
   use serde::Deserialize;

   #[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
   struct Page {
       title: String,
       content: String,
   }
   ```

2. **Create a function to fetch and parse a web page:**
   ```rust
   use reqwest::Error;
   use serde_json::Value;

   async fn fetch_page(url: &str) -> Result<Page, Error> {
       let response = reqwest::get(url).await?;
       let content = response.text().await?;
       let page: Page = serde_json::from_str(&content)?;
       Ok(page)
   }
   ```

3. **Create a function to crawl a website:**
   ```rust
   use std::collections::HashSet;

   async fn crawl(url: &str, visited: &mut HashSet<String>) -> Result<(), Error> {
       if visited.contains(url) {
           return Ok(());
       }
       visited"

Sails are typically made of materials such as canvas, polyester, nylon, or other synthetic fabrics. These materials are visible and tangible. The force that propels a sailboat is not due to the sail being made of air, but rather the interaction between the wind (which is air in motion) and the sail.

Here are some key reasons why a sailboat moves:

1. **Wind and Air Pressure Differences**: The wind blowing over the sail creates different air pressure on either side of the sail. The side of the sail facing the wind has higher pressure, while the leeward (downwind) side has lower pressure.

2. **Bernoulli's Principle**: This principle states that as the speed of a fluid (in this case, air) increases, the pressure within the fluid decreases. The shape of the sail causes the air to move faster over the curved surface, creating lower pressure on the leeward side.

3. **Sail Shape and Angle**: The angle at which the sail is positioned relative to the wind (the wind angle) and the shape of the sail itself (its camber and draft) are crucial in maximizing the lift force that propels the boat forward.

4. **Keel and Ballast**: The keel and ballast of the boat help to keep the boat stable and prevent it from being pushed sideways by the wind, allowing it to move in the desired direction.

In summary, sails are not made of invisible air, but they harness the power of the wind to move a boat by creating differences in air pressure and utilizing the principles of fluid dynamics."

### Tips for Your Picnic:
- **Timing**: Early mornings or late afternoons can be particularly peaceful.
- **Supplies**: Bring a blanket, some snacks, and a bottle of water. You might also want to bring a small cooler if you plan to have cold drinks or food.
- **Respect the Environment**: Make sure to clean up after your picnic and follow any park rules to help preserve the natural beauty of the area.

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

[Q]: Question: ""What do the factories need to keep their charters?""  Context: ""In the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of Machilipatnam on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted King James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.""  Answer:

[Q]: Question: ""Which disease does not cause more death than lower respiratory infections, TB or pertussis?""  Context: ""The top three single agent/disease killers are HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. While the number of deaths due to nearly every disease have decreased, deaths due to HIV/AIDS have increased fourfold. Childhood diseases include pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles and tetanus. Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory and diarrheal deaths.

However, many experts and organizations consider climate change to be the most urgent threat to all life on Earth. Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Rising Global Temperatures**: The increase in global temperatures is leading to more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires. These events can have devastating effects on ecosystems and human populations.

2. **Sea Level Rise**: As temperatures rise, polar ice caps and glaciers melt, causing sea levels to rise. This can lead to coastal flooding, loss of habitat, and displacement of millions of people.

3. **Ocean Acidification**: Increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere leads to more CO2 being absorbed by the oceans, causing them to become more acidic. This can harm marine life, particularly organisms with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons.

4. **Biodiversity Loss**: Climate change, along with other factors like habitat destruction and pollution, is leading to a significant loss of biodiversity. This can have cascading effects on ecosystems and the services they provide, such as pollination, water purification, and carbon sequestration.

5. **Extreme Weather Events**: Climate change is linked to an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, typhoons, and heavy rainfall. These events can cause significant damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and human settlements.

While climate change is often cited as the most pressing issue, other threats like deforestation, pollution, overfishing, and pandemics also pose significant risks to life on Earth. Addressing these issues requires a multifaceted approach involving international cooperation, policy changes, and individual actions."

To address these challenges, various organizations, governments, and communities are implementing a range of conservation efforts. Here are some of the current efforts to preserve coral reefs in the Caribbean:

1. **Marine Protected Areas (MPAs):** Many countries in the Caribbean have established MPAs to protect coral reefs and the marine life that depends on them. These areas restrict activities such as fishing, anchoring, and pollution to allow coral reefs to recover and thrive.

2. **Reef Restoration:** Various organizations are working on coral restoration projects, which involve growing coral in nurseries and then transplanting them onto degraded reefs. This can help to rebuild damaged coral communities and increase biodiversity.

3. **Climate Change Mitigation:** Efforts are being made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change, which is a major threat to coral reefs. This includes initiatives to promote renewable energy, improve energy efficiency, and reduce carbon footprints.

4. **Pollution Control:** Reducing pollution, particularly from agricultural runoff and sewage, is crucial for the health of coral reefs. Programs are in place to improve wastewater treatment, reduce the use of harmful chemicals, and promote sustainable farming practices.

5. **Education and Awareness:** Raising awareness about the importance of coral reefs and the threats they face is essential for garnering public support and encouraging sustainable practices. Educational programs and community outreach initiatives are helping to build a culture of conservation.

6. **Research and Monitoring:** Ongoing research and monitoring efforts help to understand the health of coral reefs and the effectiveness of conservation measures. This information is used to inform management decisions and adapt strategies as needed.

7. **Sustainable Tourism:** Promoting sustainable tourism practices can help to reduce the impact of tourism on coral reefs. This includes educating tourists about responsible behavior, such as not touching or standing on coral, and supporting local conservation efforts.

8. **International Cooperation:** Given the transboundary nature of many coral reef ecosystems, international cooperation is essential. Organizations like the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Caribbean Environment Programme (CEP) are working to coordinate efforts across borders and promote regional conservation strategies.

These efforts, while important, are often challenging due to limited resources and political will. However, they represent a collective commitment to preserving the unique and valuable ecosystems of the Caribbean coral reefs."

   - Apply entity recognition techniques to identify named entities, such as people, organizations, and locations, and use them to enrich the sentiment analysis.

2. Feature Extraction:
   - Use advanced natural language processing techniques, such as word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText), to convert text into numerical representations.
   - Apply techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to weigh the importance of words in the text.
   - Utilize entity recognition and semantic analysis to extract meaningful features, such as named entities, relationships between entities, and sentiment-related words.
   - Consider using contextualized word embeddings, such as BERT or ELMo, which capture the context and meaning of words in a sentence.

3. Model Selection and Training:
   - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or neural networks, for sentiment classification.
   - Train the model on the preprocessed and feature-extracted data, using techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness.
   - Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and regularization techniques to improve performance.
   - Incorporate transfer learning by fine-tuning pre-trained models, such as BERT or RoBERTa, on the specific task of sentiment analysis.

4. Evaluation and Testing:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
   - Test the model on unseen data from various domains and languages to assess its generalizability.
   - Perform error analysis to identify common mistakes and improve the model's performance.

5. Deployment and Monitoring:
   - Deploy the model in a production environment, such as a web application or API.
   - Continuously monitor the model's performance and update it as needed to maintain accuracy and relevance.

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string into a short, shareable string in JavaScript, you can use a combination of base64 encoding and URL-safe encoding. Base64 encoding will convert the string into a format that can be safely used in URLs, and URL-safe encoding will further ensure that the string is suitable for URLs.

Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. **Base64 Encode the String**: Convert the string to a base64 encoded string.
2. **URL-Safe Encoding**: Replace certain characters in the base64 string to make it URL-safe.

Here's a complete example:

```javascript
function base64Encode(input) {
    return btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(input)));
}

function base64Decode(input) {
    return decodeURIComponent(escape(atob(input)));
}

// Example usage
const originalString = ""This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL"";

// Encode the string
const encodedString = base64Encode(originalString);
console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);

// Decode the string
const decodedString = base64Decode(encodedString);
console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);
```

### Explanation:

1. **base64Encode Function**:
   - `encodeURIComponent(input)`: Encodes the string to ensure it is safe for URLs.
   - `unescape(encodeURIComponent(input))`: Decodes the encoded string.
   - `btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(input)))`: Converts the decoded string to a base64 encoded string.

2. **base64Decode Function**:
   - `atob(encodedString)`: Converts the base64 encoded string back to a binary string.
   - `decodeURIComponent(escape(atob(encodedString)))`: Decodes the binary string back to the original string.

### Example Output:

Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node using heuristic search, we can use the A* search algorithm. A* search uses a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal, which helps in finding the optimal path efficiently.

Let's define the heuristic function \( h(n) \) as the Manhattan distance from the current node \( n \) to the goal node. The Manhattan distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[ h(n) = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \]

Given:
- Pac-Man's starting position: (1, 1)
- Goal position: (3, 3)

The heuristic values for each cell can be calculated as follows:
- \( h(1,1) = |1-3| + |1-3| = 4 \)
- \( h(1,2) = |1-3| + |2-3| = 3 \)
- \( h(1,3) = |1-3| + |3-3| = 2 \)
- \( h(1,4) = |1-3| + |4-3| = 3 \)
- \( h(1,5) = |1-3| + |5-3| = 4 \)
- \( h(2,1) = |2-3| + |1-3| = 3 \)
- \( h(2,2) = |2-3| + |2-3| = 2 \)
- \( h(2,3) = |2-3| + |3-3| = 1 \)
- \( h(2,4) = |2-3| + |4-3| = 2 \)

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz and achieve the ideal foam and bloom, follow these steps and tips:

### Ingredients:
- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz egg white
- 1 oz lemon juice
- 1 oz lime juice
- 1/2 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz orange flower water
- 1 oz heavy cream
- Soda water (Topo Chico is recommended)
- Ice cubes

### Equipment:
- Cocktail shaker
- Collins glass

### Instructions:

1. **Dry Shake:**
   - Add the gin, egg white, lemon juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your cocktail shaker.
   - Shake vigorously without adding ice for about 2 minutes. This helps to emulsify the egg white and incorporate air into the mixture, which is crucial for creating the foam.

2. **Add Ice and Shake Again:**
   - Add a small amount of ice (about 3 small cubes) to the shaker.
   - Shake again until the mixture is well-chilled or until the ice has mostly melted. This ensures the drink is cold and the ingredients are fully combined.

3. **Strain and Serve:**
   - Pour soda water into a Collins glass first.
   - Strain the cocktail over the soda water.
   - Optionally, you can use a fine mesh strainer to catch any egg white foam that might have separated.

### Tips for Achieving the Ideal Foam and Bloom:

1. **Vigorous Dry Shake:**
   - The key to achieving the perfect foam is the vigorous dry shake. This step is crucial as it incorporates air into the mixture, which is essential for creating the desired foam.

2. **Proper Egg White Emulsification:**
   - Ensure the egg white is fully emulsified with the other ingredients. This will help in creating a stable foam that rises to the top of the drink.

3. **Use Fresh Ingredients:**
   - Use fresh and high-quality ingredients, especially the gin and orange flower water. The quality of these ingredients can significantly impact the taste and texture of the drink.

4. **Adjust the Amount of Ice:**
   - Start with a small amount of ice and adjust as needed. Too much ice can dilute the drink too quickly, while too little ice might not chill the drink enough.

1. **Elena Martinez**:
   - **Background**: Elena is a 35-year-old environmental scientist working for a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting endangered species and their habitats. She is passionate, dedicated, and often seen as a voice for nature in her community.
   - **Motivation**: Elena's primary goal is to preserve biodiversity and ensure that future generations can enjoy the natural world. She believes that human activities are the primary threat to the environment and is committed to finding sustainable solutions.

2. **Carlos Rodriguez**:
   - **Background**: Carlos is a 40-year-old businessman and the CEO of a large construction company. He is known for his innovative approach to urban development and has a reputation for pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the construction industry.
   - **Motivation**: Carlos is driven by the desire to create modern, efficient, and sustainable cities. He believes that urban development can coexist with environmental conservation, but only if done correctly. He is willing to invest in green technologies and sustainable practices to achieve his goals.

**Conflict**:
Elena and Carlos are in conflict over a proposed development project in a region that is home to several endangered species. The project, which involves building a new residential area and commercial center, would require significant deforestation and habitat destruction. Elena sees this as a direct threat to the survival of the species in the area, while Carlos believes that the project can be designed to minimize environmental impact and even contribute to the local economy and sustainability.

Elena argues that the project should be halted until a more environmentally friendly alternative can be found, emphasizing the importance of preserving the natural habitat. Carlos, on the other hand, believes that the project can be a model for sustainable urban development and that it will bring economic benefits to the community. He proposes incorporating green spaces, renewable energy sources, and sustainable building practices into the project.

The conflict arises from their differing views on the balance between economic development and environmental conservation. Elena feels that Carlos's approach is too focused on short-term gains at the expense of long-term ecological health, while Carlos believes that Elena's approach is too idealistic and could hinder progress and economic growth.

This conflict highlights the tension between environmental protection and economic development, a common issue in many communities around the world."

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross.

I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","Certainly! Below is a sample implementation of a REST API using FastAPI and Pydantic to manage groups of users. The API will include endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting groups. The DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) are separated into read and write DTOs.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages
First, ensure you have FastAPI and Uvicorn installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

### Step 2: Define DTOs

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class GroupWriteDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: str

class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: str
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: str
```

### Step 3: Define the Group Model

```python
from typing import List

class Group:
    def __init__(self, uid: str, name: str, thumbnail_url: str, creation_date: str):
        self.uid = uid
        self.name = name

These differences can be influenced by various factors such as climate, availability of hosts, and local ecosystems. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Climate and Seasonality**: In regions with distinct seasons, Tabanus species may have different flight patterns. For example, they might be more active during warmer months when hosts are more readily available. In tropical regions, they may be more active year-round.

2. **Host Availability**: The abundance and distribution of potential hosts (such as horses, cattle, and other large mammals) can influence flight patterns. In areas with a high density of hosts, Tabanus may be more concentrated and have more predictable flight patterns.

3. **Elevation and Topography**: In mountainous regions, flight patterns can vary based on elevation. Tabanus species may be more common in lower elevations where temperatures are warmer and hosts are more abundant.

4. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Some Tabanus species have developed specific behaviors to cope with different environments. For example, some may be more active during the day in cooler regions to avoid the heat, while others may be more active at night in warmer regions.

5. **Migration Patterns**: Some Tabanus species may exhibit migration patterns, moving to different areas based on seasonal changes or availability of hosts. This can lead to differences in flight patterns between regions.

Overall, while there may be some general patterns, the specific flight behaviors of Tabanus can vary significantly depending on the local environment and ecological conditions."

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.

Student:","3

Explanation: Passage 3 mentions Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the husband of Joanna I of Naples and the son of King Charles I of Hungary. This passage provides the necessary context to determine how many kings Hungary had before Andrew's father, King Charles I. To find the answer, one would need to search for further information about the kings of Hungary preceding Charles I, using terms from Passage 3. Therefore, Passage 3 is the correct choice."
