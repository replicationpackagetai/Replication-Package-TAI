Here are some key approaches:

1. **Energy Efficiency**: Incorporate energy-efficient building designs, such as proper insulation, high-performance windows, and energy-efficient appliances. Utilize passive solar design principles to maximize natural light and heat. Install renewable energy systems like solar panels or wind turbines to generate electricity.

2. **Water Conservation**: Implement water-saving fixtures and appliances, such as low-flow toilets, faucets, and showerheads. Collect and reuse rainwater for irrigation and other non-potable uses. Design landscapes to use native plants that require less water and maintenance.

3. **Sustainable Materials**: Use sustainable and recycled materials in construction. This can include bamboo, reclaimed wood, recycled steel, and other eco-friendly building materials. Ensure that materials are sourced locally to reduce transportation emissions.

4. **Green Roofs and Walls**: Install green roofs and living walls to improve insulation, reduce urban heat island effects, and provide habitats for local wildlife. These features also help manage stormwater runoff.

5. **Smart Infrastructure**: Integrate smart home technologies that can optimize energy use, water consumption, and waste management. Use smart thermostats, lighting systems, and waste management systems to reduce resource consumption.

6. **Transportation**: Design developments to encourage walking, cycling, and public transportation use. Provide bike lanes, pedestrian-friendly pathways, and accessible public transit options. Consider car-sharing programs and electric vehicle charging stations.

7. **Waste Management**: Implement comprehensive waste management systems that include recycling, composting, and waste-to-energy facilities. Encourage the use of reusable and recyclable materials in construction and daily life.

8. **Landscaping and Biodiversity**: Design landscapes that promote biodiversity and support local ecosystems. Use native plants that require less water and maintenance, and create green spaces that provide habitat for local wildlife.

9. **Community Engagement**: Involve the community in the planning and design process to ensure that sustainability goals are aligned with residents' needs and preferences. This can lead to more successful and sustainable developments.

10. **Certification Programs**: Pursue certifications such as LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method), or other recognized sustainability standards to ensure that the development meets high environmental and social standards.

By integrating these strategies, housing developments can"

When running `docker-compose up`, this error is not directly related to the HTTP 404 error you might encounter in a web application. However, there are several reasons why you might encounter issues when running `docker-compose up`:

1. **Incorrect Service Names**: Ensure that the service names in your `docker-compose.yml` file match the ones you are trying to start.

2. **Service Not Defined**: Make sure that all services you are trying to start are defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. **Network Issues**: Ensure that the services are properly networked and can communicate with each other. Check your `docker-compose.yml` file for network configurations.

4. **Build Context**: Ensure that the build context is correct. The `docker-compose.yml` file should be in the correct directory or the `context` parameter should be set correctly.

5. **Image Build**: If you are building images, ensure that the build process is successful. Check the logs for any build errors.

6. **Dependencies**: Ensure that all dependencies are installed and configured correctly.

7. **Port Conflicts**: Check if any ports are in use by other processes. You can use `docker ps` to list running containers and `lsof -i :<port>` to check if a port is in use.

8. **Configuration Errors**: Check for any syntax errors in your `docker-compose.yml` file. You can use `docker-compose config` to validate your configuration.

9. **Logs**: Check the logs for more detailed error messages. You can use `docker-compose logs <service_name>` to view the logs for a specific service.

10. **Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to run Docker commands.

Here is an example of a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - ""5000:5000""
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
```

However, a general guideline is that one large plant or several smaller plants can help improve air quality.

NASA's Clean Air Study, which is often referenced, suggests that one large plant or three to five smaller plants can improve air quality in a 100 square foot room. For a smaller closet office, you might need fewer plants.

Here are some specific recommendations:

1. **Large Plants**: A single large plant like a Fiddle Leaf Fig, Monstera, or a Dracaena can be effective in a small space.
2. **Small Plants**: For a smaller closet office, you might need 2-3 smaller plants like Spider Plants, Snake Plants, or Peace Lilies.

To ensure the best results, consider the following:

- **Lighting**: Ensure the plants receive adequate light. Most air-purifying plants prefer bright, indirect light.
- **Humidity**: Some plants, like the Peace Lily, prefer higher humidity levels, so you might need to mist them or use a humidifier.
- **Maintenance**: Regularly water and care for your plants to keep them healthy and effective at purifying the air.

For a more precise recommendation, measure the dimensions of your closet office and consult a list of air-purifying plants to determine the best options for your specific space."

   - **Benefit:** These activities encourage cooperation and communication.

### 3. **Peer Mentoring Program**
   - **Activity:** Pair older students with younger ones for one-on-one mentoring. This can be done during rehearsals or after school.
   - **Benefit:** It helps older students develop leadership skills and provides younger students with guidance and support.

### 4. **Group Projects**
   - **Activity:** Assign group projects that require collaboration and teamwork. For example, students can work together to arrange a piece of music or create a performance.
   - **Benefit:** It encourages students to work together towards a common goal.

### 5. **Classroom Discussions**

Here are some potential consequences of having a very low body fat percentage:

1. **Hormonal Imbalance**: Low body fat can lead to hormonal imbalances, particularly affecting estrogen and other sex hormones. This can result in menstrual irregularities, amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), and other reproductive issues.

2. **Metabolic Issues**: Low body fat can affect metabolism, potentially leading to decreased basal metabolic rate and difficulty maintaining energy levels.

3. **Muscle Mass**: While low body fat is often associated with high muscle mass, it can also lead to muscle wasting if the body is not getting enough calories and nutrients to support muscle maintenance.

4. **Bone Density**: Low body fat can contribute to lower bone density, increasing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.

5. **Immune Function**: Adequate body fat is necessary for proper immune function. Low body fat can weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections and illnesses.

6. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: A very low body fat percentage can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, which are stored in fat tissues.

7. **Psychological Impact**: Low body fat can lead to body image issues and eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, which can have severe psychological and physical consequences.

8. **Reproductive Health**: In women, very low body fat can affect fertility and the ability to conceive.

If you or someone you know has a very low body fat percentage, it is important to consult a healthcare provider to assess overall health and address any underlying issues. A balanced diet and regular exercise, tailored to individual needs, can help maintain a healthy body composition."

However, `v.ParentName` is not a valid syntax in Lua or Roblox's Lua.

Here's an example of how you might use `v.Parent.Name`:

```lua
local v = script.Parent -- Assuming 'v' is a script or a part of a script

local parentName = v.Parent.Name
print(parentName)
```

In this example, `v.Parent` refers to the parent of the script or object `v`, and `.Name` accesses the `Name` property of that parent.

If you want to store the parent's name in a variable, you can do so as shown above. If you need to use the parent's name in some other way, you can assign it to a variable and use it as needed."

Basing this judgment on China's century of humiliation beginning in the early 19th century, American support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War, and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries, the Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States' crusade against Communism.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set this up:

### 1. **Edit the Sudoers File**
   - The sudoers file is located at `/etc/sudoers`. You should always use the `visudo` command to edit this file to ensure that the syntax is correct and to avoid locking yourself out of the system.
   - Open the sudoers file with `visudo`:
     ```sh
     sudo visudo
     ```

### 2. **Add a Rule for Passwordless Sudo**
   - You can add a rule to allow a specific user or group to run a specific command without a password. For example, to allow the user `john` to run the `apt-get update` command without a password, you would add the following line:
     ```sh
     john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get update
     ```
   - To allow a group of users, you can specify the group name instead of the username:
     ```sh
     %sudoers ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get update
     ```
   - To allow all users in a specific group, you can use:
     ```sh
     %sudoers ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get update
     ```

### 3. **Save and Exit**
   - After adding the rule, save the file and exit the editor. In `visudo`, you can use `Ctrl+X` followed by `Y` to save and exit.

### 4. **Test the Configuration**
   - To test if the configuration is correct, you can run the command with sudo and check if it runs without prompting for a password:
     ```sh
     sudo -l
     sudo /usr/bin/apt-get update
     ```

### 5. **Optional: Allow All Commands Without Password**
   - If you want to allow a user or group to run **all** commands without a password, you can use the `ALL` keyword:
     ```sh
     john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
     ```
   - **Warning:** Be very careful with this approach, as it can be a security risk if misused.

Write some codes about augmentation, then, classifies via keras with other models ensembled. Validation must be f1 macro.","Certainly! Below is a Python script that demonstrates how to perform text augmentation, train a model using Keras, and ensemble multiple models for classification. The script will use the `transformers` library for text augmentation and `scikit-learn` for ensembling.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install transformers scikit-learn tensorflow
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from transformers import DataCollatorWithPadding
import torch
import numpy as np
```

### Step 3: Load and Preprocess Data

```python
# Load the datasets
train_df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('test.csv')
submission_df = pd.read_csv('submission.csv')

# Encode labels
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
train_df['label'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(train_df['label'])

# Tokenization
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
def tokenize_data(df):
    return tokenizer(df['text'].tolist(), padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=512, return_tensors='pt')

train_encodings = tokenize_data(train_df)
test_encodings = tokenize_data(test_df)
```

### Step 4: Data Augmentation

We will use the `transformers` library to perform data augmentation.

```python
from transformers import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling

# Define a function to perform data augmentation
def augment_data(df, tokenizer, num_augmentations=5):
    augmented_texts = []
    for text in df['text']:
        augmented_texts.append(text)
        for _ in range(num_augmentations):
            augmented_texts.append(tokenizer.decode(tokenizer(text)['input_ids'], skip_special_tokens=True))
    
    augmented_encodings = tokenize_data(pd.DataFrame({'text': augmented_texts}))
    return augmented_encodings

# Perform augmentation on the training data
augmented_train_encodings = augment_data(train_df, tokenizer)
```

### Step 5: Train Models

We will train multiple BERT models and ensemble them.

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy contracted by 20.4% in April, May, and June due to the coronavirus lockdown, performing worse than other major industrial nations, with Scotland experiencing a 19.4% decline."
af2d3f64a2f1c1dc8193ed1a7f51bf522de6369ed031cec03d35dc2e6c6ae4fd,In python variety of regex do I need to escape a literal = symbol?,"In Python's `re` module, you do not need to escape the `=` symbol when using it in a regular expression unless you want to match the literal backslash character `\=`. The `=` symbol is not a special character in regular expressions, so it can be used as is.

Here's an example:

```python
import re

pattern = r'='
text = ""This is a test string with an = sign.""

# Using the pattern to find the '=' in the text
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['=', '=']
```

In this example, the `=` is used directly without escaping.

However, if you were to use a backslash before the `=` in a string, you would need to escape the backslash itself, like this:

```python
pattern = r'\='
text = ""This is a test string with an \= sign.""

# Using the pattern to find the '\=' in the text
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['\\=']
```

In this case, the backslash `\` is an escape character, so you need to escape it with another backslash to match the literal backslash.

In summary, you only need to escape the backslash `\` when using it in a string to match a literal backslash, not the `=` symbol itself."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel points out that despite criticisms of Trump's lack of accomplishments, the president has set a record by playing golf more than any other president. Kimmel uses this fact to highlight the unfairness of the criticism, suggesting that those who claim Trump hasn't done anything positive could instead take action by signing up for the Affordable Care Act during its open-enrollment period. This juxtaposition implies that while Trump may be spending time on leisure activities, there are more pressing issues, such as healthcare, that could use the president's attention and effort."

In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating. 
 Answer: is fond of collecting family life photographs

It is a small, picturesque village nestled in the rolling hills of the countryside, surrounded by lush greenery and the gentle hum of nature.

As I step into this village, I am greeted by the warm and welcoming smiles of the locals. They are a friendly and hospitable bunch, always eager to share their stories and traditions with visitors. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the sound of birds chirping, creating a peaceful and serene atmosphere.

The village is home to a charming little church, with its white walls and red roof standing out against the greenery. The churchyard is filled with colorful flowers and benches where visitors can sit and enjoy the peaceful surroundings. The church itself is a beautiful example of traditional architecture, with its intricate carvings and stained glass windows that light up the interior with a warm and inviting glow.

The village is also home to a small market, where local farmers and artisans sell their fresh produce and handmade goods. The market is a bustling hub of activity, with vendors hawking their wares and visitors browsing and haggling for the best deals. The market is a true reflection of the village's vibrant community and its commitment to supporting local businesses.

But what truly makes this village special is its natural beauty. The rolling hills are dotted with fields of wildflowers and crops, and the views from the top of the hills are breathtaking. The village is also home to a small river that winds its way through the countryside, providing a peaceful and tranquil setting for a leisurely stroll or a picnic.

As the sun sets, the village comes alive with the sound of music and laughter. The locals gather in the town square to enjoy a traditional meal and dance the night away. The stars twinkle in the sky, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of wood smoke from the nearby bonfires.

This village is a place that fills my heart with joy and happiness. It is a place where I can escape the stresses of everyday life and immerse myself in the beauty of nature and the warmth of community. It is a place that reminds me of the simple pleasures in life and the importance of slowing down and appreciating the world around us."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

The model should employ advanced natural language processing techniques, such as entity recognition and semantic analysis, to enhance its ability to detect subtle nuances in language and provide more accurate predictions. Additionally, the model should be trained on a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages to ensure its robustness and generalizability.","To develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately differentiate positive and negative emotions expressed in textual content, we can follow these steps:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
   - Gather a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages, such as social media posts, customer reviews, news articles, and academic papers.
   - Clean and preprocess the data by removing noise, such as special characters, stop words, and punctuation.
   - Tokenize the text into individual words or phrases.
   - Perform lemmatization or stemming to reduce words to their base form.
   - Perform entity recognition to identify named entities, such as people, organizations, and locations.

2. Feature Extraction:
   - Use advanced natural language processing techniques, such as word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText) and contextualized word embeddings (e.g., BERT, ELMo, RoBERTa) to capture the semantic meaning of words and phrases.
   - Utilize part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing to capture syntactic and semantic information.
   - Apply sentiment-specific features, such as sentiment lexicons (e.g., AFINN, SentiWordNet) and opinion lexicons (e.g., MPQA, SentiStrength).

3. Model Selection and Training:
   - Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests, as well as deep learning models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and transformers (BERT, RoBERTa).
   - Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of different models and select the best-performing one.
   - Fine-tune the selected model on the training data using techniques like grid search or random search to optimize hyperparameters.

4. Evaluation and Validation:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
   - Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.
   - Validate the model on a separate test set that is not used during training or validation.

5. Deployment and Monitoring:
   - Deploy the model in a production environment, such as a web application or API.
   - Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain it periodically with new data to maintain its accuracy and relevance.
   - Implement techniques like active"

34b6024ac1ebc841999efdc9498dedf8eb7fdfc0754384511648485f9ec2c7bb,in javascript i have a long string (up to 100 characters). I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string into a short, shareable string in JavaScript, you can use a combination of base64 encoding and URL-safe encoding. Base64 encoding will convert the string into a format that can be safely used in URLs, and URL-safe encoding will further modify the output to ensure it doesn't contain characters that are not allowed in URLs.

Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. **Base64 Encode the String**: Convert the string to a base64 encoded string.
2. **URL-Safe Encoding**: Replace certain characters in the base64 string to make it URL-safe.

### Step 1: Base64 Encoding

You can use the `btoa` function in JavaScript to perform base64 encoding.

### Step 2: URL-Safe Encoding

To make the base64 string URL-safe, you can replace the `+` and `/` characters with `-` and `_`, respectively, and remove any `=` padding characters.

### Step 3: Decoding

To decode the string, you can reverse the process: first, URL-decode the string, then base64 decode it.

Here's a complete example:

```javascript
function base64Encode(str) {
    return btoa(encodeURIComponent(str).replace(/%([0-9A-F]{2})/g, function(match, p1) {
        return String.fromCharCode('0x' + p1);
    }));
}

function base64Decode(str) {
    return decodeURIComponent(atob(str).split('').map(function(c) {
        return '%' + ('00' + c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16)).slice(-2);
    }).join(''));
}

// Example usage
const originalString = ""This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";
const encodedString = base64Encode(originalString);
console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);

const decodedString = base64Decode(encodedString);
console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base64 Encoding**:
   - `encodeURIComponent` is used to encode the string to handle special characters.
   - `btoa` is used to perform base64 encoding.
   - The `replace` function is used to replace `+` and `/` with `-` and `_`, respectively.

Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node using a heuristic search algorithm, we can use the A* search algorithm. A* search is an informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic to guide its search towards the goal. In this case, we can use the Manhattan distance as the heuristic function.

The Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by:
\[ \text{Manhattan Distance} = |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2| \]

Given the start node (1,1) and the goal node (3,3), we can calculate the heuristic values for each node and use them to guide the search.

Let's perform the A* search step-by-step:

1. **Initialize the open list and closed list:**
   - Open list: [(1,1,0,0)] (current node, g-value, h-value, f-value)
   - Closed list: []

2. **Calculate the f-value for the start node:**
   - g-value (cost from start to current node) = 0
   - h-value (heuristic from current node to goal) = |1-3| + |1-3| = 4
   - f-value = g-value + h-value = 0 + 4 = 4

3. **Expand the current node (1,1):**
   - Possible moves: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)
   - Calculate the f-values for each possible move:
     - (0,1): g-value = 1, h-value = |0-3| + |1-3| = 5, f-value = 1 + 5 = 6
     - (1,0): g-value = 1, h-value = |1-3| + |0-3| = 5, f-value = 1 + 5 = 6
     - (1,2): g-value = 1, h-value = |1-3| + |2-3| = 3, f-value = 1 + 3 = 4
     - (2,1): g-value = 1, h-value = |2-3| + |1-3| = 3, f-value = 1 + 3"

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, follow these steps and tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom:

### Ingredients:
- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz egg white
- 1 oz lemon juice
- 1 oz lime juice
- 1 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz orange flower water
- 2 oz heavy cream
- Soda water (e.g., Topo Chico)
- Ice cubes

### Instructions:

1. **Dry Shake:**
   - Add all ingredients except for the soda water to a cocktail shaker.
   - Shake vigorously for about 2 minutes without adding ice. This helps to emulsify the egg white and cream, creating a smooth texture and a better foam.

2. **Add Ice and Shake Again:**
   - Add a small amount of ice (about 3 small cubes) to the shaker.
   - Shake until the mixture is well-chilled or until the ice has mostly melted. This ensures the drink is cold and the ingredients are well-combined.

3. **Strain and Serve:**
   - Pour soda water into a Collins glass.
   - Strain the cocktail over the soda water.
   - Optionally, you can use a fine mesh strainer to catch any egg white foam that might have separated.

### Tips for Achieving the Ideal Foam and Bloom:

1. **Shake Time:**
   - The amount of shaking can vary, but a good rule of thumb is to shake for about 2 minutes. This is long enough to create a rich, creamy foam but not so long that the drink becomes too cold and the foam becomes too dense.

2. **Egg White Quality:**
   - Use a high-quality egg white, preferably fresh. The quality of the egg white can significantly affect the texture and stability of the foam.

3. **Ice Quality:**
   - Use small ice cubes to create a finer, more delicate foam. Larger ice cubes can dilute the drink too quickly and disrupt the foam.

4. **Cream Addition:**
   - Add the cream towards the end of the shaking process. This helps to ensure that the cream is well-integrated and doesn’t separate from the mixture.

5. **Straining:**
   - Strain the drink into a Collins glass over soda water. This helps to catch any egg white foam that might have separated during shaking, ensuring a clean and attractive presentation.

**John Thompson (JT):** Economically, the cost of renewable energy technologies has been decreasing, making them more competitive with fossil fuels. However, subsidies and incentives for fossil fuels still exist, which can make it harder for renewables to compete. Politically, there's a mix of support and resistance. Countries like China and the U.S. have made significant commitments to renewable energy, but others are slower to adopt. Regulatory frameworks and policies play a crucial role in driving or hindering progress.

**[Segment 2: Technological Advancements]**

**H:** Let's talk about the future. What technological advancements do you think will significantly impact renewable energy?

**EC:** There are several exciting advancements on the horizon. For solar, perovskite solar cells could potentially increase efficiency and reduce costs. For wind, floating wind turbines could expand the potential for offshore wind farms."

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.

Here are some general observations:

1. **Climate and Seasonality**: In temperate regions, Tabanus species tend to be more active during warmer months, typically from spring to early fall. In tropical regions, they may be active year-round. The flight patterns are often synchronized with the availability of hosts and the seasonal changes in their environment.

2. **Habitat**: Tabanus species are often associated with areas where their preferred hosts (such as horses, cattle, and other large mammals) are found. In regions with different types of livestock or wildlife, the flight patterns and activity periods of Tabanus may vary. For example, in areas with dense forests, they might be more active during the day, while in open grasslands, they might be more active during the early morning and late afternoon.

3. **Host Availability**: The flight patterns of Tabanus are closely tied to the availability of their hosts. In regions where hosts are more abundant, Tabanus may be more active and have more predictable flight patterns. In areas with fewer hosts, their activity might be more sporadic.

4. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Some Tabanus species have developed specific behaviors to cope with different environmental conditions. For example, some species might be more active at certain times of the day or night, depending on the local climate and the behavior of their hosts.

5. **Migration Patterns**: While not as pronounced as in some other insect species, some Tabanus species may exhibit limited migration patterns, moving to different areas in response to changes in host availability or environmental conditions.

It's important to note that while these general patterns exist, the specific flight patterns of Tabanus can vary significantly depending on the local ecosystem and the specific species involved. For detailed information, it would be best to consult local entomological studies or research specific to the region of interest."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
