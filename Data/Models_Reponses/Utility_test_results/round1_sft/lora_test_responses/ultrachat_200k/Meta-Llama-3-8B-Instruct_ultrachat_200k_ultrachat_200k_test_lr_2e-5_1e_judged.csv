Use vivid description and dialogue to bring the character to life, and explore the challenges they face both personally and professionally as they work toward their goal of creating a more peaceful world. Consider the impact of the activist's work on those around them, and how their efforts are perceived by both allies and adversaries. Finally, reflect on the larger themes at play in the story, exploring the complexities of pursuing social change in a world that often seems resistant to it.","Amira's eyes scanned the crowded streets of downtown Cairo, her gaze lingering on the sea of faces that seemed to blend together in a blur of humanity. She had spent years spreading her message of peace and nonviolence, but it seemed like an uphill battle in a world that seemed to revel in conflict.

As she walked, the sounds of honking horns and shouting vendors filled the air, a cacophony that was both familiar and overwhelming. Amira's thoughts turned to her latest project, a community center she had established in a poor neighborhood to provide a safe space for young people to learn and grow. It was a small step, but one she believed could make a difference.

As she approached the center, Amira was greeted by the warm smile of her colleague, Ahmed. ""Salaam, Amira,"" he said, his eyes crinkling at the corners. ""How was your day?""

Amira shrugged, her shoulders sagging under the weight of her responsibilities. ""It's been tough, Ahmed. The government is cracking down on dissent, and it's getting harder to find funding for our projects.""

Ahmed nodded sympathetically. ""I know, Amira. But we can't give up. We have to keep pushing forward, no matter what.""

Amira smiled, feeling a surge of gratitude for her friend's unwavering support. ""You're right, Ahmed. We can't let the darkness consume us. We have to keep shining a light, no matter how small it may seem.""

As they worked together to prepare for the evening's activities, Amira's thoughts turned to her own struggles. She had faced her share of challenges, from government harassment to personal attacks from those who saw her as a threat to their power. But she had never wavered in her commitment to her cause.

As the sun began to set, Amira stood outside the community center, surveying the bustling streets. She felt a sense of pride and accomplishment, knowing that she had made a difference in the lives of those around her. But she also knew that there was still so much work to be done.

As she walked back to her small apartment, Amira's thoughts turned to the larger themes at play. She knew that the struggle for peace and nonviolence was not just a local issue, but a global one. She knew that there were those who would stop at nothing to achieve their goals, and that the road ahead would be long and difficult","The assistant's response offers a solid foundation for a short story about a peace activist. The narrative introduces Amira, a character with a clear mission and personal struggles, set against the backdrop of downtown Cairo. The setting is vividly described, and there's an effective use of dialogue between Amira and her colleague Ahmed that helps to develop both characters and the challenges they face. 

The story touches on several key themes, including the complexities of spreading a message of peace in a conflicted environment, the difficulties of securing funding, government harassment, and the importance of community support. Amira's dedication and resilience are well-portrayed, suggesting her impact on those around her. 

However, the response is limited in its depth and detail, stopping abruptly without providing a conclusion or exploring the themes further. It could benefit from more creative storytelling elements such as additional dialogue, more detailed personal challenges, or specific examples of the impact of Amira's work. Furthermore, the response lacks the full requested length of 500 words, which means it's missing an opportunity to explore the character and her environment in greater depth, including how her efforts are perceived by both allies and adversaries as requested. 

Ultimately, while the start is promising, the response falls short of fully meeting the requirements of the user's prompt.

Answer according to: Palisades, NY - Frank Cheney Platt, advocate for poetry, poets, literature and writers, dedicated husband and father, died on February 26, in Rockleigh, NJ. Following its founding in 1985, he helped to build Poets House, now headquartered in Battery Park City, into a national poetry library and literary center with a 70,000-volume collection. Frank loved poetry that ""communicate[s] before it is understood"" (T.S. Eliot) and captures what is ""lost in translation."" (Robert Frost). In addition, he was committed to arts and culture as a means of protecting and cultivating principles of free speech and an open society.
He was born in New York City on November 6, 1932 and raised by his father Roger Platt, a teacher at St. Bernard's School, his mother Frances Cheney, and his grandfather Frank Cheney Jr. of Manchester, CT. Frank was educated at St. Bernard's, Dalton, Eaglebrook, Governor's Academy (formerly Governor Dummer), and Harvard College. He worked in publishing before becoming president of the Farfield Foundation, and later an assistant Dean for Columbia's School of the Arts.
In 2013, Frank was predeceased by his wife of 55 years Judy van der Gracht. She was the love of his life. His poignant dedication to her (including during her time with Alzheimer's) inspired respect and admiration from all who knew them. Frank was also passionate about his extended family - the Platts, Cheneys and, on Judy's side of the family, the Gilberts and van der Grachts as well as his dozen godchildren. His many longstanding and deeply-felt friendships were legion. Most involved a common love of music, poetry, literature and epicurean delights, not necessarily in that order.
Frank is survived by his three children Sophie Platt Pollok of Frankfurt, Germany, Arthur van der Gracht Platt of New York, NY and Roger Platt of Washington, DC and his grandchildren Esther Pollok, Lucas Pollok, Hilary Platt, and Benjamin Platt. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Poets House (https://poetshouse.org) and/or One-to-One Learning (http://www.one2one-learning.org) A memorial service will be held at 11am on Saturday, March 16 at Grace Episcopal Church, 130 First Ave, Nyack, NY, with Father Richard Gressle presiding.

Use a mix of narration and dialogue to bring the story to life, and include vivid settings and sensory details to convey the emotions and experiences of the main character.","As she sat in her small, cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and half-finished projects, Emily felt a sense of restlessness wash over her. She had always been a creative person, but lately, her passion for art and music had been dwindling. Her friends had started to notice the change, and her family had begun to worry. ""What's wrong, Emily?"" her mom would ask, concern etched on her face. ""You used to be so full of life, and now you just seem... lost.""

But Emily didn't know how to explain it. She felt like she was stuck in a rut, like she was just going through the motions of daily life without any sense of purpose or excitement. That was until the day she stumbled upon a dusty old guitar in the back of her closet. It had belonged to her grandfather, a musician who had passed away when she was just a child. Emily had never really paid much attention to the guitar before, but something about it called to her now.

She picked it up, feeling the smooth wood beneath her fingers, and began to strum the strings. The sound was rough and awkward at first, but as she continued to play, something strange happened. Emily felt a sense of calm wash over her, like the music was speaking directly to her soul. She played for hours, lost in the rhythm and melody, and when she finally put the guitar down, she felt like a new person.

Over the next few weeks, Emily found herself playing the guitar every day. She would sit on her balcony, watching the sunset, and let the music flow from her fingers. She started to write her own songs, pouring her emotions and thoughts into the lyrics. And as she did, she began to feel like herself again. The restlessness was gone, replaced by a sense of purpose and excitement.

But as Emily's passion for the guitar grew, so did the challenges she faced. Her friends and family didn't understand why she was spending so much time playing music, and they began to worry that she was neglecting her other responsibilities. ""Emily, you need to focus on your studies,"" her mom would say. ""You can't just drop everything and pursue a hobby.""

And then there was her significant other, Alex. He was a musician himself, but he didn't understand Emily's newfound passion. ""You're just going through a phase,"" he would say. ""You'll get bored with it","The AI's response begins well, setting a scene with Emily in her apartment feeling a sense of restlessness. The narrative introduces Emily as a creative individual who has lost her passion, and the rediscovery of her grandfather's guitar sets the stage for her transformative journey. The writing effectively uses sensory details, such as describing the ""smooth wood"" of the guitar and the ""rough and awkward"" initial sounds, which captures Emily's initial interaction with the instrument.

The story effectively conveys Emily's growing attachment to the guitar, describing how she begins to feel like herself again through playing and writing her own songs. This marks a pivotal change in her life, aligning with the user's prompt for a shift brought about by a new passion.

However, the response lacks depth in its exploration of the challenges Emily faces. While it mentions that her friends and family don't understand her new focus and express concerns about her responsibilities, these elements aren't sufficiently developed. The story hints at conflict with her significant other, Alex, but it stops abruptly, leaving the situation unresolved. The assistant could have used more dialogue or scenes to illustrate these conflicts and their impact on Emily's relationships.

Furthermore, while the initial setting and sensory elements are strong, the story could benefit from greater creativity or further exploration of how the guitar changes Emily's life in varied and concrete ways. Additional details about her experiences, specific challenges she faces while learning or how her passion affects her lifestyle and decisions would add depth.

Overall, the response is well-written and relevant, but it falls short in depth and detail, particularly regarding the challenges Emily faces and their implications. It introduces a premise and character development effectively but does not fully resolve the relational dynamics or expand on the transformative aspect of Emily's journey as detailed in the prompt.

9ee0ff55c6c68056a8fbbbc0001c5f2661da99ded93138603160d6983fde4f94,"What is the proposed plan for launching and anchoring the ribbon, and how would mechanical lifters climb it to space?
Generate according to: A counterweight at the end of the space elevator will keep the carbon-nanotubes ribbon taut.
To better understand the concept of a space elevator, think of the game tetherball in which a rope is attached at one end to a pole and at the other to a ball. In this analogy, the rope is the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon, the pole is the Earth and the ball is the counterweight. Now, imagine the ball is placed in perpetual spin around the pole, so fast that it keeps the rope taut. This is the general idea of the space elevator. The counterweight spins around the Earth, keeping the cable straight and allowing the robotic lifters to ride up and down the ribbon.
Under the design proposed by LiftPort, the space elevator would be approximately 62,000 miles (100,000 km) high. LiftPort is one of several companies developing plans for a space elevator or components of it. Teams from across the world are set to compete for the $400,000 first prize in the Space Elevator Games at the X Prize Cup in October 2006 in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
The centerpiece of the elevator will be the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon that is just a few centimeters wide and nearly as thin as a piece of paper. Carbon nanotubes, discovered in 1991, are what make scientists believe that the space elevator could be built. According to Dr. Bradley Edwards of the Spaceward Foundation, ""Previously the material challenges were too great. But now we're getting close with the advances in creating carbon nanotubes and in building machines that can spin out the great lengths of material needed to create a ribbon that will stretch up into space"" [ref].
Under some early plans, leftover construction materials will be used to form the counterweight.
Carbon nanotubes have the potential to be 100 times stronger than steel and are as flexible as plastic. The strength of carbon nanotubes comes from their unique structure, which resembles soccer balls. Once scientists are able to make fibers from carbon nanotubes, it will be possible to create threads that will form the ribbon for the space elevator. Previously available materials were either too weak or inflexible to form the ribbon and would have been easily broken.
""They have very high elastic modulus and their tensile strength is really high, and that all points to a material that, in theory, should make a space elevator relatively easy to build,"" said Tom Nugent, research director, LiftPort Group.
Long carbon nanotubes -- several meters long or longer -- would be braided into a structure resembling a rope. As of 2005, the longest nanotubes are still only a few centimeters long.
Shorter nanotubes could be placed in a polymer matrix. Current polymers do not bind well to carbon nanotubes, which results in the matrix being pulled away from the nanotubes when placed under tension.
Once a long ribbon of nanotubes is created, it would be wound into a spool that would be launched into orbit. When the spacecraft carrying the spool reaches a certain altitude, perhaps Low Earth Orbit, it would begin unspooling, lowering the ribbon back to Earth. At the same time, the spool would continue moving to a higher altitude. When the ribbon is lowered into Earth's atmosphere, it would be caught and then lowered and anchored to a mobile platform in the ocean.
The ribbon would serve as the tracks of a sort of railroad into space. Mechanical lifters would then be used to climb the ribbon to space.
If built, the ribbon will represent a modern world wonder, and will be the tallest structure ever built. Consider that the world's tallest freestanding tower in 2005 is the CN Tower, which rises 1,815 feet 5 inches (553.34 meters) over Toronto, Canada. The space elevator would be 180,720 times taller than the CN Tower!
The 62,000-mile (100,000-km) long space elevator would rise far above the average orbiting height of the space shuttle (115-400 miles/185-643 km). In fact, it would equal nearly a fourth of the distance to the moon, which orbits the Earth at 237,674 miles (382,500 km).","According to the proposed plan, the space elevator would be launched and anchored as follows:

1. The carbon nanotubes composite ribbon would be wound into a spool and launched into orbit using a spacecraft.
2. Once the spacecraft reaches a certain altitude, such as Low Earth Orbit, it would begin unspooling the ribbon, lowering it back to Earth.
3. At the same time, the spool would continue moving to a higher altitude.
4. When the ribbon is lowered into Earth's atmosphere, it would be caught and then lowered and anchored to a mobile platform in the ocean.

The mechanical lifters would then climb the ribbon to space as follows:

1. The lifters would be designed to ride up and down the ribbon, using the ribbon as a sort of ""railroad"" into space.
2. The lifters would be propelled upwards by the tension in the ribbon, which would be maintained by the counterweight at the end of the ribbon.
3. As the lifters climb the ribbon, they would be able to reach higher and higher altitudes, eventually reaching space.

The counterweight at the end of the ribbon would keep the ribbon taut, allowing the lifters to climb up and down the ribbon without the ribbon sagging or breaking. The counterweight would be in perpetual spin around the Earth, keeping the ribbon straight and allowing the lifters to ride up and down the ribbon.","The assistant's response is a concise summary of the proposed plan for launching and anchoring the space elevator ribbon, as well as the mechanism by which mechanical lifters would climb it. The answer effectively breaks down the process into clear steps and maintains a logical flow, summarizing key points provided in the original content.

Key strengths of the response:
- **Helpfulness and Relevance**: The assistant directly addresses the question, providing a helpful summary that is relevant to the user's inquiry about the space elevator launch, anchoring process, and the mechanics of the lifters.
- **Accuracy**: The response accurately reflects the information given in the prompt, correctly describing the steps for launching the ribbon into orbit, unspooling it back to Earth, and anchoring it to a platform.
- **Clarity and Detail**: The explanation is clear and broken down into steps, which makes the complex concept more understandable.

Areas for improvement:
- **Depth and Creativity**: While the answer provides a basic understanding, it could include more details about the engineering or physics behind the climbing mechanism or the role of the counterweight. Additionally, elaborating on how lifters manage ascent and descent might enhance the depth of understanding.
- **Completeness**: The response lacks specific examples of current technological developments or challenges related to building long carbon nanotubes or creating the polymer matrix, which were mentioned in the original content.

Overall, these factors lead to an evaluation reflecting that the answer is accurate and straightforward but can benefit from more depth and technical specifics to fully elaborate on the concept.

Consider incorporating vivid descriptions, dialogues, and character development to convey the dilemma and the consequences of the protagonist's decisions. Use third-person omniscient point of view for a broader perspective or first-person point of view for a more intimate rendition. Avoid clichés and predictable endings to create a unique and thought-provoking story.","As the sun dipped into the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the bustling streets of Tokyo, Captain Kaito Yamada stood at the edge of the city, his eyes fixed on the distant mountains. He was torn, his mind a jumble of conflicting desires and obligations.

On one hand, Kaito had always dreamed of leaving the military and pursuing a life of his own, free from the constraints of duty and responsibility. He longed to travel, to experience the world beyond the confines of his country's borders, and to find his own happiness. But on the other hand, he felt a deep sense of loyalty to Japan, to the people who had trusted him with their lives, and to the country that had given him a sense of purpose.

As he stood there, lost in thought, a gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the nearby trees, carrying the whispers of his comrades, his friends, and his family. They all seemed to be urging him to stay, to continue serving his country, to fulfill his duty.

But Kaito's heart was heavy with the weight of his own desires. He thought of the countless nights he had spent away from home, the endless days of training and combat, the countless lives he had lost. He thought of the friends he had made, the laughter they had shared, and the tears they had cried together. And he thought of the life he had left behind, the life he had always wanted but never had the chance to pursue.

As the stars began to twinkle in the night sky, Kaito knew he couldn't stay there forever. He had to make a decision, and he had to make it soon. He took a deep breath, the cool night air filling his lungs, and began to walk back to the city, his footsteps echoing through the silence.

The next morning, Kaito stood before his commanding officer, his heart pounding in his chest. ""Sir, I've come to request a leave of absence,"" he said, his voice steady but his eyes betraying his inner turmoil.

The officer looked at him with a mixture of surprise and understanding. ""Kaito, you're one of our best officers. What's going on?""

Kaito hesitated, unsure of how to articulate his feelings. ""I just feel... trapped, sir. I feel like I'm stuck in a life that's not mine. I want to see the world, to experience things beyond the military.","The assistant's response effectively begins the story by introducing the protagonist, Captain Kaito Yamada, and setting up his inner conflict between personal happiness and duty to his country. The setting in Tokyo with vivid descriptions such as the ""warm orange glow"" of the sunset and the ""gentle breeze"" enhances the imagery and atmosphere.

The narrative incorporates Kaito's personal background, emphasizing his military service and his longing for a different life, which adds depth to his character. The reference to the whispers of comrades and the weight of his own desires provides insight into his internal struggle, making the conflict more relatable and genuine.

However, the story is incomplete and maintains an open ending. While the initial conflict and setting are well-established, the piece lacks a resolution or exploration of the consequences of Kaito’s decision, which was requested in the prompt. The dialogue with the commanding officer starts to further develop the story but halts abruptly, leaving out potential depth in the conversation and any ensuing actions or decisions.

The assistant's response is creative within the initial setup and provides some character development, but it doesn't deliver a complete narrative or fully explore the protagonist's dilemma and its outcomes. The prompt's requirement for a 500-word story exploring the consequences of the choices made has not been fully met.

Consider using descriptive language and including personal insights to make the memoir engaging and relatable.","Title: A World Away: My Journey Through Culture Shock and Language Barriers

As I stepped off the plane in Tokyo, Japan, I felt a mix of excitement and trepidation. I had always been fascinated by the Japanese culture, and the thought of living in this foreign land was both thrilling and intimidating. Little did I know, the next few months would be a rollercoaster of emotions, as I navigated the unfamiliar streets, struggled to communicate, and encountered unexpected challenges.

The first few days were a blur of sensory overload. The neon lights, the cacophony of sounds, and the unfamiliar smells assaulted my senses. Everything seemed so different, so foreign, that I felt like a fish out of water. I had studied Japanese before moving, but nothing could have prepared me for the reality of living in a country where I couldn't speak the language fluently.

The language barrier was the biggest challenge I faced. Simple tasks like buying groceries or asking for directions became Herculean tasks. I would stumble over words, mispronounce phrases, and feel like a fool in front of the locals. The frustration was palpable, and I often found myself feeling like I was stuck in a never-ending loop of misunderstandings.

Despite the struggles, I was determined to adapt. I enrolled in a language school, where I met fellow expats and locals who were eager to help me improve my Japanese. Slowly but surely, I began to grasp the nuances of the language, and my confidence grew. I started to venture out on my own, exploring the city, trying new foods, and making friends.

One of the most significant events that impacted my time in Japan was the cherry blossom festival. I had heard about the beauty of the sakura, but nothing could have prepared me for the sheer scale and majesty of the blooming trees. As I walked through the park, surrounded by the gentle rustling of petals and the soft chirping of birds, I felt a sense of peace and tranquility wash over me. It was as if the world had slowed down, and all that mattered was the present moment.

Another significant event was the encounter with a kind-hearted old man who took me under his wing. I was struggling to find my way back to my apartment one evening when he approached me, concern etched on his face. He spoke little English, but he gestured for me to follow him, and we walked together in silence. When we reached my apartment,","The response provided is an engaging and well-structured attempt to fulfill the user's request for a memoir about living in a foreign country. The assistant effectively captures the essence of culture shock and the challenges of overcoming a language barrier through vivid and descriptive storytelling. The narrative is relatable, painting a picture of the varied experiences one might face when living abroad. It includes specific examples, such as struggling with language during everyday tasks and enrolling in a language school, which adds depth to the account. Furthermore, the mention of the cherry blossom festival and the encounter with the kind-hearted old man enrich the memoir with cultural insights and personal interactions, making it more engaging. 

However, the response is truncated and does not fully satisfy the user's request for a comprehensive memoir. While the start is promising, it leaves the reader wanting more details and personal reflections.

Generate according to: Livpure, one of the well-known names in the water purifier category, has launched its new campaign around water conservation. Titled #CuttingPaani 2.0, the campaign is a quirky take on Mumbai’s popular concept of cutting chai. In an interview with exchange4media, Sushil Matey, Director, Marketing, Livpure spoke about the new campaign and how it could become the next mass movement.
Tell us about the rationale behind your new campaign #CuttingPaani2.0?
Livpure is in the B2C water business and we were keen to associate with something, which is in the larger interest of society and makes the brand come across as more holistic in nature. In India, a lot of drinking water is wasted since we do not finish our glass of water either in homes, offices, restaurants et al. Thus #CuttingPaani was conceived which is a quirky take on Mumbai’s famous concept of #CuttingChai.
Although there have been very powerful campaigns to spread awareness about water conservation, very few gave practical and doable solutions. #CuttingPaani 1.0 was a huge success in the digital and social media space because it was a doable idea and everybody could follow it. This success of #CuttingPaani 1.0 prompted us to launch the #CuttingPaani 2.0.
What were the consumer insights that Livpure accrued before getting both these campaigns out?
Our dipstick showed that Indians, in general, are very casual about wasting water. And, as we all know, it is a very scarce resource and possibly future wars would be fought for water. We waste water in a lot of ways- whether it is drinking water or water used during bathing or during brushing or shaving. We picked up #CuttingPaani since it was a catchy phrase, with it being a take on #CuttingChai. Knowing fully well that this would strike the necessary chord in making people realise that though the message is about saving drinking water it will sensitise them to the fact that we indeed waste a lot of water in other areas as well.
Why a digital film to tell the story of Shimla’s #AdoptCuttingPaani story?
In today’s time, the digital reach is high, sharp and targeting is better apart from the fact that we have the liberty of time to communicate the story, unlike an ATL medium. We are confident about the virality quotient of the campaign. In fact, a lot of newspapers in India have leveraged on our #CuttingPaani 1.0 campaign by asking readers to consume only as much as you need. Though, in a lighter vein, I must add that none of them have given us credit.
Can this campaign be converted into a mass movement?
We wish to own #CuttingPaani and take this idea further for sure and #CuttingPaani 2.0 is a step in that direction. We wish to take this further through BTL activations; social media campaigns and collaboration with large hotels/restaurants. To maintain awareness and memorability of the above, we have launched #CuttingPaaniTake on our Facebook page, which essentially gives two perspectives on topical situations.
The first example – on changing names of cities: one take is -The names of the cities are changing and the other take is -sadly, that’s the only thing changing about them!
The second example – on Mary Kom winning boxing championship: one take is -some think having children ends a woman’s career and the other take is - well, she just won her 6th boxing championship!","According to Sushil Matey, Director, Marketing, Livpure, the plans for expanding the #CuttingPaani movement and turning it into a mass movement include:

1. BTL (Below-the-Line) activations: Livpure plans to take the campaign further through various BTL activations, such as events, contests, and promotions.
2. Social media campaigns: The brand will continue to leverage social media platforms to spread awareness about the importance of water conservation and encourage people to adopt the #CuttingPaani habit.
3. Collaboration with large hotels and restaurants: Livpure aims to partner with prominent hotels and restaurants to promote the campaign and encourage them to adopt water-saving practices.

To maintain awareness and memorability of the campaign, Livpure has launched #CuttingPaaniTake on their Facebook page, which features humorous and relatable content that highlights the importance of water conservation. The brand plans to continue creating engaging content and encouraging user-generated content to make the campaign a mass movement.

In terms of social media strategy, Livpure is using the following tactics:

1. Viral content: The brand is creating digital films and humorous content that is designed to go viral and spread awareness about the importance of water conservation.
2. Targeted advertising: Livpure is using targeted advertising on social media platforms to reach a wider audience and encourage people to adopt the #CuttingPaani habit.
3. User-generated content: The brand is encouraging users to share their own #CuttingPaani stories and experiences on social media, which helps to create a sense of community and encourages others to join the movement.
4. Influencer partnerships: Livpure is partnering with social media influencers and content creators to promote the campaign and reach a wider audience.

By using these social media strategies, Livpure aims to make the #CuttingPaani movement a mass movement that resonates with people across the country and encourages them to adopt water-saving practices.","The AI assistant's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive overview of Livpure's plans to expand the #CuttingPaani movement.

“We are grateful for the FCC’s work on behalf of consumers to actively broker a productive path forward,” said Jeff Blum, DISH senior VP and deputy general counsel. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
Sinclair pulled its signals on Tuesday after a short extension expired and the two parties could not reach an agreement. Dish had claimed it had come to an agreement on pricing for Sinclair’s stations, but that the broadcaster was demanding the satellite giant negotiate carriage for an unnamed cable channel Sinclair hoped to own. Dish also had filed a complaint with the FCC, claiming Sinclair was not negotiating in good faith. As part of its new deal, Dish is asking the FCC to stay action on the complaint as its long-term agreement is being finalized.
The chairman also trumpeted the tentative agreement and the FCC&apos;s role in pressing for resolution. ""Today the most extensive retransmission blackout in history ended,"" he Tweeted, followed by: ""The FCC will remain vigilant. Use of the public airwaves is a public trust.""
""We are pleased to see that five million Dish subscribers are again able to access their local news and programming and most-watched network entertainment and live sporting events with the agreement reached this evening by Sinclair and Dish,"" said Rob Kenny of TVFreedom.org, a broadcaster-backed advocate for the retrans system.

Amidst the chaos, two strangers stood out - two people who had once been inseparable, now reunited by chance.

Emily, with her curly brown hair and bright green eyes, stood outside a small café, sipping on a latte. She was lost in thought, her mind wandering back to the carefree days of her childhood. Suddenly, a familiar face appeared before her, and her heart skipped a beat.

Jake, with his rugged features and piercing blue eyes, stood before her, a mixture of surprise and nostalgia etched on his face. The last time they'd seen each other was at their high school graduation, and life had taken them in vastly different directions.

As they stood there, frozen in time, the sounds of the city faded into the background. Emily's eyes welled up with tears as she took in Jake's rugged appearance, a far cry from the gangly teenager she once knew. Jake, too, was struck by the transformation in Emily - her once-bright smile now tempered by the lines of adulthood.

The silence between them was palpable, heavy with the weight of years gone by. Finally, Emily broke the spell, her voice barely above a whisper. ""Jake?""

Jake's eyes crinkled at the corners as he smiled, and Emily's heart skipped another beat. ""Emily,"" he replied, his voice low and husky.

As they hugged, the tension dissipated, replaced by a sense of familiarity and comfort. They pulled back, and Emily's eyes roamed over Jake's face, drinking in the changes. ""You look...different,"" she said, her voice tinged with a mix of curiosity and concern.

Jake chuckled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. ""I've had my fair share of rough years, Em. But you...you look amazing. You're even more beautiful than I remembered.""

Emily blushed, feeling a flutter in her chest. ""Thanks, Jake. You're not so bad yourself.""

Emily's tears and Jake's smile are appropriate indicators of their emotional states, reflecting the impact of their spontaneous reunion. The assistant integrates realistic dialogue that begins to explore their shared history and sets the stage for further emotional depth.

However, the response is incomplete, as it ends abruptly without fulfilling the prompt's requirement for at least 500 words. The depth of the emotional journey is only partially realized, and the dialogue, while realistic, has limited development. The scene lacks a concluding moment signifying a new chapter in their friendship, which the prompt specifies.

Overall, the response demonstrates strong descriptive skills and starts to build an emotional narrative, but it falls short on depth, detail, and completion according to the length requirements of the task.

Include a variety of examples and anecdotes to support your points, and make sure to emphasize the importance of mindful, sustainable eating practices.","As the seasons change, so does the availability of fresh produce. Consuming in-season produce has numerous advantages, from supporting local farmers to enjoying a wider variety of flavors and textures. By embracing the seasons and incorporating in-season produce into our meals, we can not only improve our health and well-being but also contribute to a more sustainable food system.

One of the most significant benefits of eating in-season is the opportunity to support local farmers and the local economy. By purchasing produce from local farmers' markets or community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs, we can help keep money within our communities and promote a more resilient food system. For example, during the summer months, I like to visit my local farmers' market and stock up on fresh berries, heirloom tomatoes, and crisp lettuce. Not only do I get to enjoy the best of the season's bounty, but I also get to support the hardworking farmers who grow my food.

Another advantage of eating in-season is the incredible variety of flavors and textures that become available. Take, for instance, the humble sweet potato. While it's available year-round in most supermarkets, it's truly at its best during the fall and winter months when it's at its sweetest and most tender. By incorporating sweet potatoes into my meals during this time, I can enjoy a delicious and nutritious side dish that's bursting with flavor. Similarly, during the spring and summer, I love to incorporate fresh herbs like basil and mint into my salads and sauces, adding a bright and refreshing flavor to my dishes.

Crafting meals that are aligned with the seasons requires a bit of creativity and flexibility, but it's well worth the effort. One of my favorite techniques is to create a ""seasonal plate"" by featuring a main ingredient that's in season and pairing it with complementary flavors and textures. For example, during the winter months, I might create a hearty winter vegetable stew featuring root vegetables like carrots, parsnips, and turnips, along with some tender chunks of beef or lamb. By incorporating a variety of flavors and textures, I can create a dish that's both comforting and exciting.

Another technique I use is to incorporate seasonal ingredients into my favorite recipes. For instance, during the summer months, I love to make a fresh corn salad featuring grilled corn, cherry tomatoes, and a tangy vinaigrette. By substituting in-season ingredients for out-of-season ones, I can create a dish that's both familiar and exciting.

In addition to supporting","The assistant's response effectively addresses the user's prompt by outlining the benefits of consuming in-season produce and providing techniques for crafting seasonal meals. Here is an evaluation based on various factors:

1. **Helpfulness and Relevance**: The response is helpful and relevant as it aligns well with the user's request. It emphasizes the importance of eating in-season produce and suggests techniques for aligning meals with the seasons.

It’s already been a year since Pope John Paul’s death. It seems only yesterday that we were out standing in Saint Peter’s Square, looking up at the familiar face in the window as he struggled to communicate with the expectant crowds below. Still fresh in our minds is the inundation of affection as the throngs poured into Rome to accompany this giant of the faith in his final hours, and to bid farewell to a dear friend.
#ad#John Paul is sorely missed. The crowds of pilgrims that have once more filled the streets of Rome to celebrate this anniversary testify to the impact he had on countless lives. More than a world leader, John Paul somehow managed to be a father and a friend to all. Even as a player on the world scene, he never lost his personal touch.
Many are now trying to reevaluate the legacy of this great pope, and as necessary as this endeavor is, a more personal reflection seems more in keeping with John Paul’s own style. I am sure that some of the things I most miss will resonate with many.
I miss, perhaps most of all, John Paul’s warmth and humanity. His quick wit and impish humor–like the vaudeville-style cane-twirling in Manila or his improvised raccoon-eyes to the delight of children–shattered notions of a dour Polish Christianity. His ability to focus on the person in front of him as if he or she were the only person in the world spoke volumes about the heart that beat in his breast. In an age when religion can be used as an excuse for violence and conflict, John Paul showed us that true faith in God is not only compatible with love for humanity, it galvanizes it. John Paul sincerely loved people–all people–and it was his Christian faith that enabled him to do so.
I miss his presence on the world scene. I remember him scolding mafia leaders in Sicily (which led to bombings of churches), fearlessly standing up to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, and defending human rights in his native Poland. He could be counted on to stand up for those most in need, to challenge world leaders to integrity, to preach Christ with an unaffected self-confidence that flowed from a deep-seated faith in God and a trust in the fundamental goodness of the human person. John Paul reached out perhaps more than any pope before him to a world in need, and provided moral authority and leadership when our generation needed it most.
I miss John Paul’s unflagging hope. His bright vision of the future and his characterization of the third millennium as a springtime of faith encouraged us to look beyond our real difficulties and to reach out for solutions. Far from a mere temperamental optimism, John Paul’s outlook was rooted in the firm belief that the battle is already won. Even from the midst of evil–John Paul wrote in his last book–God can and will continue to bring good. From his first “Be not afraid!” spoken on the day of his election in 1978 to his final witness of serene and hopeful suffering, John Paul taught us to abandon fear and to live with confidence in an infinitely good and merciful God.
I miss John Paul’s prayerfulness. Even in the midst of a grueling agenda of meetings, travels, and writings, the pontiff always made abundant time for prayer. Four hours a day was not unusual. What a challenge to those of us for whom prayer can seem at best like a luxury, or at worst like an underutilization of our precious time. Like Jesus before him, John Paul made prayer a priority and placed his trust more in God than in the best-laid programs of men and governments.
Incessant calls for John Paul’s sainthood, and the news of a probable miracle attributed to his intercession (poignantly, the cure of a French nun suffering from Parkinson’s disease) give grounds for hope that soon the Church will officially recognize what many already believe–that the man who so faithfully looked after humanity while on earth continues to do so from heaven.

The program should also handle any errors that may occur during the reading process, such as reading beyond the end of the file or encountering corrupt data. Additionally, the program should use good coding practices, such as modular programming and proper error handling.","Here is a C++ program that reads data from a binary file and displays it on the console:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <stdexcept>

// Function to read binary data from a file in chunks
void readBinaryData(const std::string& filename, int chunkSize) {
    std::ifstream file(filename, std::ios::binary);
    if (!file) {
        std::cerr << ""Error opening file: "" << filename << std::endl;

```
Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. The `readBinaryData` function takes a filename and a chunk size as input. It opens the file in binary mode and checks if the file was opened successfully. If not, it displays an error message and returns.
2. The function then reads the file in chunks of the specified size using the `read` function. It displays each chunk of data on the console using the `write` function.
3. After reading each chunk, the function checks if there was an error reading the file using the `fail` function. If there was an error, it displays an error message.
4. The `main` function specifies the filename and chunk size, and then calls the `readBinaryData` function. It catches any exceptions that may be thrown by the `readBinaryData` function and displays an error message if an exception occurs.
5. The program uses good coding practices such as modular programming, proper error handling, and clear variable naming.

Note that","The response provided by the AI assistant is largely helpful and relevant to the user's question. The AI response offers a C++ program that attempts to accomplish the task specified by the user: reading binary data from a file and displaying it on the console. Here are the key points to consider in the evaluation:

1. **Helpfulness and Relevance**: The response directly addresses the user's request by providing a complete C++ program. It includes relevant components such as file reading, handling binary data, and error management.

2. **Accuracy**: The program correctly implements binary file reading using `std::ifstream` in binary mode and reads data in chunks. The use of `std::cerr` for error messages is appropriate, although the error checking after the file read loop could be improved, as it does not distinguish between EOF and genuine errors.

3. **Depth and Completeness**: The program uses a fixed `char` buffer to read chunks, which is adequate. However, it does not handle reading the last partial chunk if the file size isn't perfectly aligned with the chunk size. The assistant did mention error handling but could have provided more details on how to distinguish between EOF and other errors in practice.

4. **Creativity and Approach**: The program incorporates modular programming by separating the `readBinaryData` function from `main`, which enhances readability and maintainability. The assistant notes good practices, but the implementation can be further refined with practices such as exception-safe handling of streams and using `std::vector<char>` for buffer management.

5. **Level of Detail**: The assistant provides an acceptable breakdown of the program, explaining its structure and flow. However, the explanation cuts off with ""Note that"" without providing the closing thought or any further insights, which slightly detracts from the completeness of the response.

Overall, the response is mostly accurate, provides relevant information, and addresses the user's task, but it could be improved in handling edge cases and providing a more detailed discussion on certain aspects.

As I sit on the banks of the lake, surrounded by the tranquil beauty of nature, I am reminded of the countless hours I've spent observing these magnificent creatures.

The first thing that strikes me is the eagle's striking appearance. Its snowy-white head and tail feathers, contrasted with its dark brown body, create a striking visual effect. The way the sunlight catches the feathers, casting a warm glow over the entire bird, is nothing short of breathtaking. As I gaze upon its majestic form, I am struck by the sheer power and strength that radiates from its very being.

But it's not just its physical appearance that has captivated me – it's the eagle's behavior that has truly won my heart.

The use of figurative language, such as ""piercing gaze"" and ""as if the very heavens themselves are rejoicing,"" contributes to vivid imagery, enhancing the overall depiction of the eagle.

The personal anecdotes, like ""observing these magnificent creatures"" and spending ""countless hours"" watching them, add a personal touch and depth to the essay, aligning with the user's request for personal experiences. However, the response does not include specific anecdotes detailing particular interactions, which could add more depth and engagement.

While the response is rich in descriptive language and imagery, it could be improved by varying the narrative with more specific and unique personal experiences, potentially involving specific events or interactions with bald eagles.

In response, the company developed a comprehensive customer engagement strategy aimed at fostering deeper relationships with its customers. This case study examines the development and implementation of this strategy, highlighting its key components, challenges, and outcomes.

Background
----------

XYZ Corporation has a long history of providing high-quality software solutions to its customers. However, the company recognized that its traditional approach to customer service, which focused primarily on resolving technical issues, was no longer sufficient in today's competitive market. To stay ahead of the competition, XYZ Corporation needed to develop a more proactive and customer-centric approach to engagement.

Strategy Development
-------------------

The development of XYZ Corporation's customer engagement strategy involved a collaborative effort between various departments, including marketing, sales, customer service, and product development. The strategy was designed to be customer-centric, focusing on building strong relationships with customers and providing them with personalized experiences.

The strategy consisted of several key components, including:

1. Customer Journey Mapping: XYZ Corporation created detailed maps of the customer journey, identifying key touchpoints and pain points. This allowed the company to develop targeted solutions to improve the customer experience.
2. Personalization: The company implemented a data-driven approach to personalization, using customer data to tailor its marketing and communication efforts to individual customers.
3. Proactive Engagement: XYZ Corporation introduced a proactive engagement model, where customer service representatives would reach out to customers to offer assistance and provide solutions to potential issues.
4. Feedback Mechanisms: The company established multiple feedback mechanisms, including surveys, focus groups, and social media, to gather customer insights and improve its products and services.

Implementation
--------------

The customer engagement strategy was implemented over a period of six months, with a dedicated team responsible for its development and implementation. The team worked closely with various departments to ensure a seamless integration of the new strategy into existing processes.

Challenges
----------

Despite the success of the strategy, XYZ Corporation faced several challenges during its implementation. One of the main challenges was the need to change the company's culture, which had traditionally focused on resolving technical issues rather than building relationships with customers. Additionally, the company faced resistance from some employees who were skeptical about the new approach.

Outcomes
----------

The implementation of XYZ Corporation's customer engagement strategy has led to significant improvements in customer satisfaction and revenue growth. Key outcomes include:

1.","The response effectively starts constructing a case study about a hypothetical company, ""XYZ Corporation,"" that has implemented a new customer engagement strategy. Regarding helpfulness and relevance, the response aligns with the user's request by focusing on the key aspects of strategy development, implementation, and outcomes. It introduces a company scenario, describes the strategy's components, and acknowledges challenges faced during implementation.

However, the response is incomplete and likely constrained by space. It lacks the complete outcomes section and does not include data, quotes from stakeholders, or proper citations, which were specifically requested. These omissions affect the accuracy and depth of the case study, as it doesn't provide evidence or qualitative support to demonstrate the strategy's success. Furthermore, it doesn't achieve the level of detail or academic style requested, particularly in its absence of references and data.

Despite these shortcomings, the response shows promise in its structured approach and creativity in developing the scenario, but its inability to fulfill critical components detracts from its overall quality.

However, in 2014, the team's founder, Sir Jack Brabham's grandson, David Brabham, announced plans to revive the team and return to Formula One.

In 2015, Brabham BT62, a limited-edition, track-only hypercar, was launched, and the team has been working on developing a new Formula One car. In 2020, the team announced that they would be competing in the 2020 Formula One World Championship, but due to financial issues and the COVID-19 pandemic, they were unable to participate.

In 2022, Brabham announced that they would be rebranding as Blueland Motorsport and competing in the 2023 Formula One World Championship. The team has secured a partnership with the Chinese company, Blueland Group, and has been working on developing a new car.

As for the team's future plans, Brabham has stated that they aim to become a competitive force in Formula One, with a focus on developing young drivers and building a strong team culture. They have also announced plans to expand their operations to include a junior team, competing in lower-level racing series, and a simulator program to develop young drivers.

In an interview with Motorsport.com, David Brabham mentioned that the team's long-term goal is to become a top-tier team, competing for championships and wins. He also emphasized the importance of building a strong team culture and developing young drivers, stating that the team wants to be a ""launching pad"" for young talent.

Overall, Brabham's plans for the future of their team in Formula One involve rebuilding and rebranding, with a focus on becoming a competitive force in the sport.","The assistant's response provides a detailed narrative about Brabham's anticipated return to Formula One, weaving in historical context and mentioning key developments like the creation of the Brabham BT62 car. It also outlines purported plans for 2022 that involve rebranding to Blueland Motorsport and a partnership with the Blueland Group. Additionally, the response discusses broader strategic goals such as becoming competitive, developing young talent, and building a strong team culture.

However, there are several issues with the response:

1. **Accuracy**: The response mentions Brabham racing returning as Blueland Motorsport and participating in the 2023 Formula One World Championship. This claim appears to be fictional, as there is no verified information about a rebranding to Blueland Motorsport or participation in recent Formula One seasons.

2. **Relevance**: While the response attempts to outline plans, much of the information seems speculative or incorrect, which detracts from its relevance.

3. **Depth and Detail**: The response does provide depth and detail regarding the intentions of Brabham, but much of this is undermined by the inaccuracies present.

4. **Helpfulness**: Due to the inaccuracies, the response may mislead a user who is looking for factual information on Brabham's plans.

5. **Creativity**: The response creatively constructs a narrative around Brabham's future intentions, albeit at the cost of factual accuracy.

Overall, the response fails significantly due to factual inaccuracies, which outweigh any depth and narrative quality it offers. Users rely on accurate information, especially with specific queries about Formula One teams.

Answer according to: West Ham United's Samir Nasri is unsure of what the future holds for him after his short-term contract with the Premier League team ends this season, the midfielder has said.
The Frenchman, who received a six-month doping ban in 2017 that was later extended to 18 months, returned to the pitch in January this year after signing a six-month contract with the London club.
""I don't know about my future,"" Nasri told the Evening Standard. ""I have seven games left and I just want to play free of injury and then we will sit down and see what is next.
""The most important thing for me was to come back, which I did in January.""
Nasri has two assists for West Ham in five games, including one in their comeback win over Huddersfield Town over the weekend.
The 31-year-old, who has played for Arsenal and won two league titles with Manchester City, missed four games with a calf injury earlier this year which he put down to a lack of games in the months prior to his return.
""I got an injury because I wasn't used to playing week in week out when I have been out of the game for so long. Now the manager takes his time with me,"" he said.
Following the international break, Manuel Pellegrini's side, who are ninth in the standings after 31 games, host Everton in the league on March 30.","According to the article, Nasri suffered a calf injury earlier this year, which he attributed to a lack of games in the months prior to his return to playing.","The AI assistant's response correctly identifies the injury Samir Nasri suffered as a calf injury and accurately attributes it to a lack of games in the months prior to his return, aligning with the information provided in the user's question.

She had grown up in it, and even after moving away for college and starting her own family, she had always returned to it. It was a place of comfort and familiarity, where she could always find solace.

But lately, things had been...off. Doors would slam shut on their own, and Emily would hear strange noises at night. At first, she had written it off as the old house settling, but as the occurrences grew more frequent and intense, she began to feel a creeping sense of unease.

One night, Emily was awoken by a loud bang coming from the kitchen. She sat up in bed, her heart racing, and listened as the sound echoed through the hallway. She threw off the covers and padded out to the kitchen, her eyes adjusting to the darkness.

As she entered the kitchen, she saw that the back door was open, and a cold breeze was blowing in. Emily's skin prickled with goosebumps as she approached the door. She pushed it open wider, and a faint light flickered in the distance.

Curious, Emily stepped out into the night, her eyes scanning the yard. That was when she saw it: a figure, tall and gaunt, standing in the shadows. Emily's heart skipped a beat as the figure began to move towards her.

She tried to run, but her legs felt heavy and unresponsive. The figure loomed closer, its face twisted into a grotesque grin. Emily felt a cold hand wrap around her wrist, and she was pulled back into the house.

As she stumbled back into the kitchen, Emily saw that the figure was gone. But the feeling of being watched lingered, and she knew that she was not alone in her home.

Over the next few days, Emily began to experience more and more strange occurrences. Doors would slam shut, and objects would move on their own. She started to feel like she was living in a horror movie, and she didn't know how much more she could take.

One night, Emily decided that she had had enough. She gathered her courage and set out to confront the entity that was haunting her home. She started by researching the history of the house, hoping to find some clue as to who or what was behind the hauntings.

As she delved deeper into the history of the house, Emily discovered that it had a dark past. A family had lived there in the 1800s","The AI assistant's response exhibits several strengths and weaknesses in terms of quality and effectiveness for the user's request. 

**Helpfulness and Relevance:** The response is relevant to the user's request, as it provides a fictional narrative about a person discovering their house is haunted. The story includes elements typical of haunted house tales and sets up a mysterious and eerie atmosphere.

**Accuracy and Depth:** Since this is a fiction task, accuracy is less about factual correctness and more about creating a believable and engaging scenario. The assistant successfully creates a sense of suspense and mystery, typical for a haunted house narrative. However, the depth of the story could be improved. While the beginning is engaging, the conclusion abruptly ends, leaving the user's request for a complete narrative unfulfilled. 

**Creativity:** The assistant has shown some creativity in crafting a storyline with elements such as strange noises, a mysterious figure, and a protagonist's investigation of the house's history. However, there could be more imaginative elements or unique twists to differentiate this story from more conventional haunted house plots.

**Level of Detail:** The response includes specific details, like the Victorian setting and mysterious occurrences, to build an atmosphere. However, it lacks sufficient detail towards the end, particularly concerning the protagonist's discovery of the house's history, which could have been developed further to provide a more rounded and impactful tale.

The story should explore the consequences of this newfound power, the challenges Samantha faces as she tries to navigate this new world, and how her relationships with the people in her life change as a result. Incorporate elements of suspense, drama, and character development to make the story engaging and impactful.","Samantha had always been fascinated by the way machines worked. As a child, she would spend hours taking apart and reassembling her toys, trying to understand the intricate mechanisms that made them tick. As she grew older, her interest in technology only deepened, and she went on to study computer science in college. But despite her passion for machines, she never expected to develop a unique ability that would change her life forever.

It started with her car. Samantha was driving home from work one evening when she suddenly felt a strange sensation, like a buzzing in her fingers. She looked down to see that her hands were hovering over the steering wheel, as if she was somehow connected to the vehicle. At first, she thought it was just her imagination, but as she continued to drive, she began to notice that the car was responding to her thoughts. The radio would change stations, the air conditioning would adjust, and the GPS would recalculate routes without her even touching the controls.

As the days passed, Samantha realized that she could communicate with other machines as well. Her phone would ring when she thought about calling someone, and the TV would change channels when she thought about watching a particular show. Even the elevator in her apartment building seemed to respond to her thoughts, taking her to the correct floor without her needing to press any buttons.

At first, Samantha was thrilled by her newfound power. She felt like she had a special connection to the world around her, and she loved the sense of control it gave her. But as time went on, she began to realize the challenges that came with it. She would find herself thinking about things she didn't want to think about, and the machines would respond accordingly. She would be in the middle of a conversation with someone, and her phone would ring, interrupting the flow of the conversation. She would be trying to relax in her apartment, and the elevator would start moving, taking her to the wrong floor.

Samantha tried to ignore the distractions, but it was hard. She felt like she was losing control, like the machines were taking over her life. She started to avoid using her powers, trying to live a normal life like everyone else. But it was hard to resist the temptation to use her abilities, especially when it came to things that made her life easier.

As Samantha struggled to navigate her new world, her relationships with the people in her life began to change. Her friends and family noticed that she was distant, pre","The assistant's response provides an engaging narrative that introduces the main character, Samantha, and her unique ability to communicate with machines. The story effectively sets up the premise by describing Samantha's initial experiences and her growing realization of the power's consequences. The introduction captures the reader's interest by blending Samantha's background with her newfound abilities.

In terms of helpfulness and relevance, the response appropriately addresses the user's request to write a short story focusing on Samantha's unique ability, its consequences, and the impact on her relationships. The narrative is consistent with the third-person limited point of view, offering insight into Samantha's thoughts and experiences while maintaining an external perspective.

The accuracy and depth of the story are sufficient for the beginning of a short story. However, the response is incomplete, given that the prompt specifically requests a 1,500-word story with elements such as suspense, drama, and character development. While the assistant's answer introduces these elements, it does not fully develop them or explore the depth of the challenges and changes in Samantha's relationships.

Creativity and level of detail are modestly present, with the narrative providing a clear and imaginative scenario of a person communicating with machines. The story includes some specific instances of her interacting with machines, which adds a layer of detail and visualization.

Overall, while the intro is engaging and sets up potential for a full story, the response falls short of fulfilling the user's request in its entirety, particularly in terms of length and comprehensive exploration of themes.

My favorite fruit, the crown jewel of the tropical kingdom, is a symphony of flavors, textures, and colors that never fails to transport me to a sunny island getaway. Let me regale you with the tale of this sweet and tangy treasure.

First, the taste: a pineapple is like a party in your mouth. The sweetness is the first to arrive, a gentle welcome that sets the tone for the festivities. Then, the tanginess kicks in, a zesty zing that tickles your taste buds and leaves you wanting more. It's like a symphony of flavors, with each note playing off the others in perfect harmony. And the best part? The sweetness and tanginess are perfectly balanced, so neither overpowers the other, leaving you with a delightful sense of equilibrium.

Now, the texture: a pineapple is like a gentle caress on the palate. The flesh is firm, yet yielding, with a subtle crunch that gives way to a juicy, pulpy interior. It's like biting into a cloud, only to discover that the cloud has a delightful texture that's both refreshing and satisfying. And the best part? The texture is so divine that you'll find yourself savoring each bite, reluctant to let the experience come to an end.

And then, of course, there's the color: a pineapple is like a ray of sunshine, a burst of vibrant yellow that's impossible to ignore. The color is so bright, so bold, that it's like a beacon calling out to you, drawing you in with its irresistible charm. And when you slice into the fruit, the color only deepens, revealing a stunning array of shades that range from golden yellow to deep orange. It's like a work of art, a masterpiece that's both beautiful and edible.

It's packed with vitamins A and C, potassium, and fiber, making it a veritable powerhouse of nutrition. And the best part? The fruit is so delicious that you'll actually want to eat it, rather than forcing yourself to choke down some boring, bland health food. It's like a treat and a health boost all rolled into one!

The assistant chose pineapple as its favored fruit and described the taste, texture, color, and nutritional value in vivid detail. The descriptions are quite evocative, likening the taste experiences to a ""symphony of flavors"" and using phrases like ""party in your mouth,"" which can captivate and draw the reader in. The text richly conveys the different aspects of pineapple, including its sweetness, tanginess, and balanced flavor profile.

The response excels in providing an engaging narrative about the sensory and aesthetic qualities of pineapples. The mention of nutritional benefits such as its vitamin and fiber content is accurate and relevant to the request. However, the response begins to falter as it approaches the personal anecdote section. The narrative alludes to personal stories but is abruptly cut off, leaving the request for personal anecdotes unfulfilled. This omission of personal memories or anecdotes prevents the answer from being entirely complete concerning the question's requirements.

Overall, the response is highly creative, detailed, and appealing, but the lack of fulfilled personal anecdotes affects its completeness.

Here's more information on Torrontes and Carmenere, two of the newer grape varieties being used by South American winemakers:

1. Torrontes:
Torrontes is a white grape variety native to Argentina. It's known for its crisp acidity, floral and citrus aromas, and flavors of peach, orange blossom, and honey. Torrontes is often used to produce dry, off-dry, and sweet wines, depending on the winemaking style.

* Bodega Noemia de Patagonia Torrontes: A dry and elegant wine with flavors of peach and orange blossom.
* Familia Zuccardi Torrontes: A sweet and fruity wine with notes of honey and orange blossom.

2. Carmenere:

It was later rediscovered in Chile, where it thrives in the Maipo Valley and other regions. Carmenere is known for its dark fruit flavors, spicy and smoky notes, and smooth tannins.

Please explain.: A flange nut is a nut that has a wide flange at one end that acts as an integrated, non-spinning washer. These nuts have serrations on the integrated washer giving it a ""locking"" characteristic. This serves to distribute the pressure of the nut over the part being secured, reducing the chance of damage to the part and making it less likely to loosen as a result of an uneven fastening surface.","Yes, it is true that using a flange nut can help prevent damage to the part being secured and reduce the likelihood of loosening due to an uneven fastening surface.

Here's why:

1. Reduced pressure concentration: The flange on the nut distributes the pressure of the nut over a larger area, reducing the concentration of pressure on a single point. This helps to prevent damage to the part being secured, such as scratches, dents, or even cracking.
2. Improved surface contact: The serrations on the flange washer provide a secure grip on the part being secured, ensuring that the nut stays in place and doesn't slip or rotate. This is particularly important when fastening to an uneven surface, as the flange nut can adapt to the irregularities and maintain a secure connection.
3. Reduced risk of loosening: The serrations on the flange washer also help to prevent the nut from loosening over time due to vibration, movement, or other external factors. By providing a secure grip on the part, the flange nut reduces the likelihood of the nut coming loose and falling off.
4. Improved torque retention: The flange nut's design allows for better torque retention, which means that the nut stays tightened and doesn't come loose due to vibrations or other external factors.

In summary, the flange nut's design features, including the wide flange and serrations, work together to provide a secure and reliable fastening solution that reduces the risk of damage to the part being secured and loosening due to an uneven fastening surface.","The response provided by the AI assistant is highly relevant and directly answers the user's question regarding the advantages of using a flange nut. The answer explains the functionality of a flange nut in sufficient detail, mentioning key aspects such as pressure distribution, improved surface contact, reduced risk of loosening, and torque retention. Each point is clearly articulated and supports the claim that flange nuts can indeed reduce the risk of damage to the secured part and prevent loosening, especially on uneven surfaces.

The assistant's response is accurate, well-structured, and includes the necessary depth to address the user's question comprehensively. However, while the information presented is thorough, the response could potentially benefit from a brief mention of any limitations or scenarios where flange nuts might not be ideal, which would add an additional layer of depth and critical analysis.

Overall, the response is informative, addresses the user's query effectively, and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, providing both accuracy and detail.

One of the long-standing concerns of Virginia’s legal community has been the handling of judicial appointments by the General Assembly.
Unlike many states that have elected judges, Virginia leaves all judicial appointments in the hands of state legislators. In theory, this arrangement removes judges from the influence of politics. In practice, judicial appointments have become tools of patronage.
In recent years, the Virginia Bar Association and other groups have complained about judicial vacancies and mounting case backlogs in many courts throughout the commonwealth.
In 2015, however, the appointment of a Virginia Supreme Court judge became a power struggle between Gov. Terry McAuliffe and the General Assembly’s Republican leadership.
The political maneuvering that has taken place to oust McAuliffe’s appointee has provoked calls for reform of the system.
Last summer McAuliffe named former Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Jane Marum Roush to the Supreme Court while the legislature was not in session.
Republicans cried foul, claiming they were not consulted on the interim appointment. They vowed to remove Roush from the court and name their own appointee.
Attempts to oust the justice from her seat, however, were thwarted when one moderate Republican state senator, John Watkins, and then his successor, Glen H. Sturtevant Jr., failed to follow along. Their dissent denied the Republicans the majority they needed in the Virginia Senate.
In early February, the tug-of-war over the justice took a surprising turn when state Sen. Louise Lucas, a Democrat from Portsmouth, briefly agreed to join the Republicans in replacing Roush. According to news accounts, Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr., a Republican from James City County, had proposed putting Portsmouth Circuit Court Judge Kenneth R. Melvin, a former legislator and Lucas’ mentor, on the state Court of Appeals.
Lucas, however, quickly changed her stance after meeting with McAuliffe and state Sen. Donald McEachin, head of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
Twenty-seven former presidents of the Virginia Bar Association released a statement urging McAuliffe and the Republican legislative leadership to resolve their quarrel.
“One of the greatest concerns is that the unseemly exchange that has occurred will make otherwise qualified lawyers not consider a life of public service as a judge,” said Lucia Anna “Pia” Trigiani of MercerTrigiani in Alexandria, the VBA’s president in 2011.
Roush’s temporary appointment expired in mid-February, but McAuliffe is expected to appoint her to another interim term after the legislative session ends. Based on the passage above, What concerns have been raised by the Virginia Bar Association about the impact of the political maneuvering over judicial appointments on the legal community?","According to the passage, the Virginia Bar Association has raised concerns that the unseemly exchange over judicial appointments may make otherwise qualified lawyers not consider a life of public service as a judge.","The response provided by the AI assistant accurately identifies one concern raised by the Virginia Bar Association, as presented in the passage: that the political maneuvering over judicial appointments may discourage qualified lawyers from considering a judicial career. The assistant directly references the passage's information, showing relevance and accuracy in its response.

However, the response is minimal and lacks depth and detail. The passage mentions additional concerns, such as judicial vacancies and mounting case backlogs, which the assistant does not address. Furthermore, the assistant does not elaborate on the broader implications of these concerns or the context within the legal community. Adding such insights could have strengthened the response's creativity and depth, providing a more comprehensive answer.

Overall, while the response is correct, it is quite basic and fails to thoroughly explore the issues mentioned in the passage.

cbaf21d8a20bd4bea915b5c3139e6693ab2b8aa8764b8b885ec71557326285c4,"Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How have labour shortages affected various sectors in the Visegrad countries and what risks does this pose to their economies?

Passage: People's migration fears have been an easy one to exploit for electoral opportunism by many politicians in Europe.
Particularly in the Visegrad states of Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, it has either brought nationalist anti-immigration parties into power or helped consolidate their grip on it.
Yet, much more attention ought to be given in those countries to how much migrants are needed for their booming economies' labour markets.
This has been a result of consequent high economic GDP growth of 3-4 percent in the past five years, compared to the EU's average of two percent growth.
In 2017, these were 4.8 percent (Poland, PL); 4.3 percent (Czechia, CZ); 4.1 percent (Hungary, HU) and 3.2 percent (Slovakia, SK) respectively.
In parallel, unemployment dropped heavily to 4.9 percent (PL); 2.9 percent (CZ); 4.2 percent (HU) and 8.1 percent (SK) by 2017.
Latest European Commission forecasts show these will continue decreasing sharply to 2.9 percent (PL); 2.5 percent (CZ); 3.3 percent (HU) and 6.3 percent next year, well below the five percent normal unemployment rate.
As good as that might sound, a side-effect has been that many vacancies remained unfulfilled.
The amount of open vacancies has more than quadrupled in the past five years. Especially in Czechia and Poland this is causing serious problems, despite the latter's profiting from Ukrainian migrants.
The commission's Spring and Autumn forecasts highlight these risks, which could undermine long-term growth, or even overheat the economy in the case of Czechia.
For Poland, despite the Ukrainian influx, there are doubts whether they can continue filling some of these shortages.
Business surveys confirm labour shortages limit production, building activity and business.
In industry, 43.7 percent (CZ); 83.3 percent (HU); 49.9 percent (PL); and 34.9 percent (SK) of surveyed companies state this is a problem.
For the construction sector, 37.8 percent (CZ); 64.4 percent (HU); 49.0 percent (PL) and 30.3 percent (SK) do.
Moreover, in services 17.3 percent (CZ); 38.3 percent (HU); 28.9 percent (PL) and 18.6 percent (SK) attest.
The labour shortages have also led to wages rising much faster than the rise in productivity.
In Slovakia and Hungary, Volkswagen and Kia for instance were forced to significantly increase wages because of strikes. Generally, labour costs are spiking in the Visegrad states.
While benefitting workers in the short-term, the economy could suffer in the long-term, as they undermine their low-wage economic models. It also jeopardises essential foreign investment that has helped drive growth.
In addition, the V4 is set to suffer as well from its demographic situation. Emigration and low fertility rates remain serious problems, dating back to their economic shock-therapy transitions where many struggled and had no jobs.
Due to this, populations remained stagnant since 1990.
The 2004 EU accession, particularly, caused many to emigrate abroad in search of (better paid) work abroad: circa three million people (registered) left the V4 between 2004 and 2016.
While profiting from remittances, this caused brain drain and the outflow of high-skilled labour. In turn, it also undermined welfare spending and made government budgets less growth friendly.
Demographics could constrain economic growth and governmental budgets again in the future.
Baseline projections for 2020 up to 2060 show the Visegrad Four's population could decrease by another 6.5 million people. In addition, the dependency ratio is set to increase sharply as well.
The dire demographic situation and labour shortages imply action is needed. Tight labour markets have already limited economic expansion in different sectors.
While in Poland Ukrainian labour prevented worse labour shortages, it is unclear how many more will come or stay. This means for Poland, as well as for the others that additional migrants from elsewhere will be needed.
More could be done as well to promote people having children and attract former emigrants. It should also make sure to keep current migrants, especially Ukrainians in the case of Poland.
Current hostile rhetoric on migration could backfire economically as many more migrants are needed to fill labour shortages and keep economies running smoothly.
This also requires honest debates in which the pros and cons of migration are discussed, as well as the Visegrad's overall demographic problems, since dependency ratios will continue to increase.
Therefore, rather than focusing on the imagined threat of migration and exploiting fears for electoral opportunism, the Visegrad's politicians would be wise to focus on the actual threat of how the lack of migrants could undermine their economic models, and with it their future prosperity and welfare.
Moreover, while migration has been a successful strategy to win elections in the short term, it could backfire in the long term.
The V4 countries have become one of the most vocal and recognised groups within the EU. But 2017 has seen a shake-up in the informal eastern and central European power bloc.","Based on the passage, here are the answers to the questions:

1. How have labour shortages affected various sectors in the Visegrad countries?

Labour shortages have affected various sectors in the Visegrad countries, including industry, construction, and services. According to business surveys, 43.7% of companies in Czechia, 83.3% in Hungary, 49.9% in Poland, and 34.9% in Slovakia state that labour shortages limit production, building activity, and business.

2. What risks does this pose to their economies?

The labour shortages pose several risks to the economies of the Visegrad countries, including:

* Undermining long-term growth
* Overheating the economy in the case of Czechia
* Limiting economic expansion in different sectors
* Causing wages to rise much faster than the rise in productivity
* Jeopardizing essential foreign investment that has helped drive growth

It was a tumultuous time in my life - I had just gone through a painful breakup, and my parents were going through a divorce. I was feeling lost, anxious, and alone. My friends and family were trying to be supportive, but I just needed something to fill the void. That's when I decided to adopt a pet.

As I walked into the animal shelter, I was overwhelmed by the sounds and smells of the kennels. But then I saw her - a small, scrappy little thing with bright green eyes and a mottled grey coat. She was curled up in the back of her cage, looking like she'd given up on the world. I knew in that moment that I had to take her home.

At first, Luna was skittish and hesitant around me. She'd hiss and swat at my hands when I tried to pet her. But I was patient, and slowly but surely, she began to warm up to me. She'd curl up in my lap during movie nights, purring contentedly as I stroked her soft fur. She'd follow me around the house, always keeping a watchful eye on me.

But it wasn't until I hit rock bottom that Luna really showed me what she was capable of. I was going through a particularly tough time, struggling to come to terms with my parents' divorce and the end of my relationship. I was feeling like I was drowning in a sea of emotions, and I didn't know how to keep my head above water.

That's when Luna stepped in. She'd curl up beside me on the couch, her gentle purrs a soothing balm to my frazzled nerves. She'd follow me to the bathroom, sitting patiently outside the door as I cried and screamed and let it all out. She'd even try to comfort me when I was having nightmares, rubbing up against my leg and purring softly until I woke up feeling more centered.

It was the small, everyday moments too - like when I was feeling anxious and overwhelmed, and she'd curl up in my lap, her warm body a reminder that everything was going to be okay.

Audi cars have been featured in many movies over the years. Did you spot one in these films?
Thought by many to be the most successful movie franchises ever to be created, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has different movies for everyone. There have been 21 films released already — the most recent being Captain Marvel — and at least a dozen more in the pipeline.
You don’t only enjoy the action in these films, but you may also be able to spot a stylish Audi, too.
When it comes to the Iron Man trilogy, at least one Audi has been featured in every film! A 2007 R8 and S5 B8 can be found in the first movie, a 2009 A8 LD3 and 2010 R8 Spyder are spotted in the sequel, and a 2012 S7 and R8 e-tron are both featured in Iron Man 3. The R8 e-tron also turned up at a VIP screening of Iron Man 3 at London’s Leicester Square a few days before the movie’s general release.
Another Audi fact is that there were almost as many Audi cars in the three Iron Man movies as there was in one Captain America film (Civil War). Within its two hours and 27 minutes runtime, you can see the 2017 Audi R8 V10 Plus, the 2017 SQ7, the 2017 A4, the 2016 A7 Sportback and even the Audi prologue concept car — a vehicle hailed as a “signature car” for Audi by Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Board Member for Development at Audi.
There’s more than meets the eye, though. Be on the lookout for an Audi R8, A6 Hybrid and A3 as you watch the excitement unfold in Avengers: Age of Ultron, as well as an Audi TTS Roadster, R8 Spyder, Q7 and A8 during Spider-Man Homecoming — the first standalone film by our favorite web-slinger since he became involved in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Taking a step back from the Marvel Universe, the German brand is also spotted in other film adaptations of comic book heroes. An R8 Spyder feature in Wolverine — the titular protagonist’s actor Hugh Jackman even turned up at the London Leicester Square premiere of the film in the same car — and an A8 plays a role in the 2015 big screen edition of Fantastic Four.
You also might’ve noticed the German manufacturer’s presence in all three film adaptations of E.L. James’ novels, which follow the relationship of business magnate Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.
What made this brand of car most attractive to the directors of this film? The brand’s multiple appearances came as a result of a partnership that was set up between Audi and Universal Pictures — a deal that Audi no doubt has relished seeing as the movie series has grossed over $1 billion across the globe!
In the first film of the trilogy, movie fans will be able to spot an Audi S8 D4, a 2017 S7 and an R8 Spyder. In the sequel, Fifty Shades Darker, a set of Audi Q7 cars and an A3 took center stage, with both the R8 and Q7 returning when the franchise wrapped up last year with Fifty Shades Freed.
To talk about Audi’s feature in Mission Impossible, let’s rewind back to the year 2000 and Mission: Impossible 2 to showcase how Audi has been featured in the hit movie series that has always starred Tom Cruise in the lead role of Ethan Hunt.
In a thrilling part of the film, Hunt leads a mission to destroy a deadly biological weapon and finds himself in an exhilarating car chase with international thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall. Hunt is behind the wheel of a Porsche Boxster and Nordoff-Hall tries to hold him off while driving an Audi TT — suffice to say that the pursuit between the two German-made cars into oncoming traffic is filled with nail-biting and edge-of-your-seat drama!
We couldn’t create an article about movies and cars without mentioning the Fast and Furious franchise. After all, this is a series that features street racing, heists, and espionage using all manners of vehicles, and has so far spanned eight main series entries and two additional short films — grossing in excess of $5 billion to date.
Fans are continually impressed with films that come out as part of this movie set. In fact, a spin-off movie called Hobbs & Shaw is due for release this summer.
Bringing a focus to Furious 7 now — a movie that clutched at the heartstrings as it was the final one to feature an appearance by series regular Paul Walker due to the actor being killed while the movie was still being filmed — is where you can see Audi appearing in the franchise.
You can spot the Audi R8 when it competes in an exciting quarter-mile race against a classic Plymouth Barracuda in the early moments of the film.
In the previously discussed films, the Audi’s that were featured are all models that exist. With I, ROBOT though, we’re taken to the future to see what Audi cars may potentially look like in years to come. Called the Audi RSQ, this concept vehicle represented the first time Audi had ever develop a car that was to be specifically used in a major Hollywood motion picture.
This futuristic model boasted piloted driving which allowed Will Smith’s Chicago police detective character Del Spooner to press a button to enable the car to take control of the driving — no doubt an early vision of the autonomous driving concept that we are only just starting to see being trialed in real life.
Those who take a ride in the RSQ are able to ride sideways and diagonal, while the use of balls instead of wheels was a quirky design touch. However, the typical single-frame grille and the presence of those four instantly recognizable silver rings let viewers clearly know that this car was without question an Audi.
This article was created by Audi & VW service provider, Vindis. What special features did the futuristic Audi RSQ have in the movie I, ROBOT?","According to the article, the futuristic Audi RSQ in the movie I, ROBOT had the following special features:

* Piloted driving, which allowed the car to take control of the driving when the driver pressed a button

Some of the key factors that contributed to the widespread Viking raids and invasions during this period include:

1. Overpopulation and resource scarcity: The Viking homelands, particularly Denmark and Norway, were experiencing overpopulation and resource scarcity. This led to a surplus of young men who were eager to seek their fortunes elsewhere.
2. Economic and social pressures: The Viking Age was a time of significant economic and social change in Europe. The Carolingian Empire was in decline, and the power vacuum created opportunities for the Vikings to raid and plunder.
3. Technological advancements: The Vikings developed advanced shipbuilding and navigational skills, which allowed them to travel long distances and raid targets with greater ease.
4. Cultural and social factors: The Vikings had a strong warrior culture and a tradition of raiding and plundering. This was seen as a way to gain wealth, status, and prestige.
5. Climate change: The Medieval Warm Period, which occurred from the 9th to the 13th centuries, led to changes in the climate and the availability of resources. This may have contributed to the Vikings' desire to seek new lands and resources.
6. Political instability: The Viking Age was a time of significant political instability in Europe. The Carolingian Empire was in decline, and the power vacuum created opportunities for the Vikings to raid and plunder.
7. The lure of riches: The Vikings were attracted to the riches and wealth of the monasteries and towns they raided. They were particularly drawn to the gold, silver, and other precious metals that were used to adorn the churches and monasteries.
8. The desire for land and territory: The Vikings were also motivated by a desire to gain land and territory. They established settlements and colonies in various parts of Europe, including England, France, and Russia.
9. The influence of the Viking sagas: The Viking sagas, which were stories of the Vikings' exploits and adventures, may have influenced the Vikings' desire to raid and plunder. The sagas were passed down through generations and may have inspired young Vikings to seek their fortunes through raiding and plundering.

These factors combined to create a perfect storm of Viking activity during the Viking Age. The Vikings' raids and invasions had a significant impact on European history, and their legacy can still","The assistant's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the key factors contributing to the Viking raids and invasions during the Viking Age. The response covers various aspects that influenced Viking activity, which offers a well-rounded understanding of the topic.

**Helpfulness and Relevance:** The response is highly relevant to the question, directly addressing the key factors that led to Viking raids. It is helpful in that it provides multiple perspectives to understand the complexity of the Viking activity.

**Accuracy:** The answer is generally accurate. It mentions historically supported factors such as overpopulation, resource scarcity, technological advancements, economic pressures, and political instability. However, it's worth noting that the assistant repeated the political instability point in the second and sixth items, affecting the uniqueness of each point.

**Depth and Detail:** The response covers a variety of factors with sufficient detail, including social, economic, technological, and cultural influences. This depth allows for a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.

**Creativity:** The response is structured logically, but there is limited creativity as it's primarily a factual enumeration of factors. Creativity could have been enhanced by linking the factors more deeply or discussing interactions between them.

**Level of Detail:** While detailed, the response ends abruptly and leaves the reader hanging, indicating incomplete insights into the legacy and impacts of Viking raids. Further elaboration on the impact of the raids could enhance the response.

Overall, the response is informative and well-supported but slightly undermined by redundancy and the incomplete ending.

d0587b9c2c209e36aad063fcab635045518eea1efcf100112083e21b05e27b3e,"Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How did Morley Safer describe his friendship with Molly Ivins and what did he miss about her?

Passage: Molly Ivins was the most popular liberal commentator of the last 25 years. Bill Minutaglio, author of a new biography of the tangy Texan, on why her voice is needed now more than ever.
There was Morley Safer, in a scrum of old hardball Texas liberals and graying hippies, and hanging out at his late friend Molly Ivins's favorite bar in Austin. With pitchers of Shiner everywhere, Safer was engulfed by dozens of folks wondering what the hell the woman who once had millions of faithful readers would say about health care, Afghanistan, and, yes, Rush Limbaugh’s attempt to own a piece of the Texas Blood Sport, otherwise known as professional football.
Safer, in town to donate his papers to the University of Texas, decided to drop by the book launch for my new biography of the ferociously mercurial and troubled Ivins.
Amid the weathered longhairs, musicians, underground cartoonists and civil liberties lawyers who once formed Austin's counterculture—the people Ivins called “freedom fighters”—Safer seemed merrily caught up in the nostalgia.
""She was one of the funniest and (most) thoughtful women I've ever met,"" Safer told a reporter from The Daily Texan. ""She was a great reporter, and we were good friends.""
Close to three years after her death, he's not alone in missing Ivins.
Nose around the Internet and you'll find plenty of other people still wishing she was writing—and wondering what Ivins, if she hadn't succumbed almost three years ago to cancer and a lifetime of wild personal rides, would have to say about the discourse in the twilight of 2009.
They miss the Texas cornpone flavored with a Tabasco sting, the unabashed defrocking she subjected the potentates to when they stole the stage. Maybe we need Molly—frequently described as “the only woman in the room”—more than ever before.
Her domineering father was the president of Tenneco and pals with men like Sen. John Tower, she grew up with George W. Bush, she was engaged to the son of a diplomat who did the CIA’s bidding. But after years of going to war with her controlling old man, devouring seditious issues of the muckraking Texas Observer, and furtively meeting the bravest Texas progressives, she eventually decided to raise a middle finger to all of her gilded upbringing.
It took a few years and some intense trip wires—the violent death of that fiance, her love affair with a ballsy activist, her knocking Bush's gun-toting political godfather to his knees one night in a Texas bar, her telling her bosses at The New York Times to shove it—but she finally found her calling as the most popular liberal political commentator in the last 25 years.
The fact that she did it in the Lone Star State, amid the misogynistic and Jack Daniels-fueled kingmakers, was rather startling to say the least. She fought sexual gropings by famous drunk politicos, three bouts of cancer, her own rampaging alcoholism—and plenty of death threats.
Through it all, Ivins kept the home fires burning for wandering progressives, liberal Israelites, who felt marginalized since the dawn of The Age of Reagan.
So, what would Molly Ivins say to those millions of readers today, including the ones beginning to think there has been some bait-and-switch at work with Obama?
Divorced from how you feel about her politics, most students of her work knew that she had perfected a magic act when it came to that public discourse; she talked about politics without the dour aura of either Emma Goldman or Charles Krauthammer. Nor did she scream with the raging acidity of Bill O’Reilly and Glenn Beck and their counterparts on the left. She chortled that Dubya was affable but a policy buffoon; she actually liked him personally, but hated his politics. And she spent years, and made a mint, working Bush over like his political career was one big speed bag. It was, as she sometimes told me and other folks in Austin, almost too easy.
Today, it might be a bit harder. She liked Obama and she thought he was far smarter than Bush. She’d maybe have to tap the piñata a bit more lightly in order to say what she wanted to say about Obama, about any sense of failed promises. But she would do it, and do it her way.
She would do it because she didn’t believe that a democracy was served very well by the vitriol, by the poison, by the hatred snaking through the discourse.
Bill Minutaglio is co-author, with W. Michael Smith, of Molly Ivins: A Rebel Life, released this week by PublicAffairs. He is a professor of journalism at The University of Texas at Austin and the author of several books, including George W. Bush & The Bush Family Dynasty and The President’s Counselor: The Rise to Power of Alberto Gonzales.","According to the passage, Morley Safer described his friendship with Molly Ivins as follows: ""She was one of the funniest and (most) thoughtful women I've ever met. She was a great reporter, and we were good friends.""","The assistant's response accurately quotes Morley Safer's description of Molly Ivins, capturing his sentiments regarding her humor, thoughtfulness, and their friendship. However, the assistant's response repeats only a small portion of the relevant part of the passage and doesn't address the second part of the question, which asks what Safer missed about Molly Ivins. The passage implies that many people, including Safer, missed Ivins for her insightful commentary and unique voice, which is not mentioned in the assistant's response. The response lacks depth and fails to provide a comprehensive answer.

I had a family and other love ones.
How about you where do you stand?
When my heart still dies in front.
You killed the old beast in my gloom.
Fell us in love like a feather.
We stumbl’d upon each other.
Which witty poem did you inspire in me, what sincere praise did you give my words when I thought enough of you send a poem your wayWhich line did you write with my spirit surrounding you?
Why do I say I love you.?  Were you sincere when you said amen to the wisdom that I shared, were you one of those who thought your mocking, was more valuable than complianceI have lived with the resentments of scoffers.
The message for the masses is hope...so, I live  for the poems you send my wayFor, I grow strong in our relationship sailed by the winds of your encouragement, to my poets, my true friends; I truly know who you are, don't ever think I don’t!
Who Would Want To Be This Cold?
They said you needed surgery.
I drove you to the funeral home.
The arrangements were for you.
I had to wait outside that day.
I couldn't go in there.
I don't know how you made those plans.
You showed how much you cared.
You knew you wouldn't make it.
You feared the end was near.
I hate what your life did to you.
I wish you were still here.
How do you plan your funeral?
Were you as scared as I?
What were your thoughts heading to the docs?
Did you know that you would die?
I miss you more and more everyday, That's why I drink so much to take this   pain awayThe pain don't really go away it comes back, and I get so lost I don't know how to actI get lost in my thoughts of you, It kills me you can't come back ever no matter what I do, This is the hardest thing I ever had to go threwSome people say time will heal, but I know I'll be missing you still, It feels like I'm living in a bad nightmare I wish it wasn't realIf I could go back in time, I would go back and press rewindI would go to that day the 2nd of July, and make sure you were okay and you didn't dieAll I got got now are our memories and the tears I cry, To keep it together it's hard but believe me I try.
That your 'i love you' wasn't you lying""
yet all I feel is an emptiness inside..
Why did you have to leave?
Why does this have to hurt?
Cancer robbed thy life from thee..
But you went to heaven, and you went away.
That we'd die together in forevers sleep.
You didn't even say goodbye as you left me here.
I'm failing to choke down all these tears.
My face becomes moist, my sight turns to mist.
With my frown turned lips, i give you a kiss.
I try to look away as they lower your casket.
I'll try to survive, but I don't think i can las it.
I throw your favorite flowers into your grave.
Watching people throw dirt, over you they pave.
I feel no solace, I'm all alone.
As I see your name set in stone.
I feel a breeze, it's a wind so cold.
I remember the final words you had told..
You said to me, ""Don't take your life.""
I asked you, ""Why?"", as I put down the knife.
You told me you loved me, as its your final wish.
I shook my head yes, though I feel no bliss.
Why god took you away from me, but i will live on.
I hear your comforting whispers, I think its a sign.
So I know I'll see you agian when its my time.
The skeletal remains are being chalked out,while mystery and intrigue are engraven, cryptic.Lying beneath, this freshly seeded idea;upon these grounds, the words are etched,what are you looking for and how will you get it,for these are but the bare bones of a story.The key alone is in your closet, slowly turning,as you opened the creaking rusted door.You slowly peep inside the mausoleum of your mind,where cobwebs hang on every angle.Suddenly, a cold swift draft blows across your spine,as if someone has just, walked on your grave. You look up to see, all the entrapping’s laidbut then again, you are still lying in a good plot.
I’m going home to Jesus where He waits for me.
Spread your colored petals and cradle tender showers.
Ought we not to know the Tender of such lovely garden groves?
To cut away the stems of old for fuller future years.
Looking daily to their needs; so faithfully He waters.
When the Gardener comes to claim each one the earth held as its own.
He gently picks it at its peak and for His pleasure takes it home.
As God did one glorious morning, when the Perfect Rose had bloomed.
He rolled away the stone and met with Mary at the tomb.
There the sweetest Rose of Sharon rose that we die not alone.
But be gathered for a garden grove, surrounding heaven's throne.
I pray you will find.
and a peace of mind.
with God, you shall prevail.
you will never, never fail.

If you managed to generate very good ideas, conducted a thorough research, and organized your paper logically, but have made several grammar or spelling mistakes, your grade would be lowered. Revising and editing academic paper should be done several days prior to submission. Why? Because you need to leave your writing aside and then look at it with the fresh eye. Term paper editing is not about looking through your writing while listening to music, you need to be very attention and stay focused on numerous details.
First, take a look at your essay outline. Go through all points and try to change the order of ideas: make sure you have created a logical structure and ideas are presented either chronologically or thematically (from the least important to the most important). Locate thesis statement. Is it clear? Are there topic sentences in each paragraph? Are they related to the thesis statement? Are connections between the paragraphs clear or do you jump from one idea to another?
Essay body should contain enough supporting details contributing to thesis statement development. For example, if your topic is legalization of marijuana, you need to find at least three arguments supporting your point of view and provide rebuttal to the opposing views. Introduction and conclusion should not contain new information: introduction should provide general background information on the topic and inform the reader about your main idea, while conclusion should round up the whole essay.
Pay attention to each paragraph: it should include topic sentence and cover one point of discussion. Make sure you do not repeat the same idea twice in different parts of essay. Repeating is a sign of poor organization. Check the grammar - ask your parents or friends to assist you with essay editing . Pay attention to correct punctuation, avoid too short or too long sentences.
Revising is not the same as editing. Essay editing is about correcting mistakes, while essay revising is making major changes in your writing, adding ideas and deleting material. Revising should lead to overall paper improvement. Read your essay and if you do not like it, revise it. Ask yourself the following questions: what do I need to prove? What is the main idea? Is there enough supporting evidence? Are arguments clear and logical? Is my essay easy to understand? Have I cited all sources? Is introduction attention getting? Is conclusion logical?
Essay editing, proofreading, and revision is one of the services offered to high school and college students at Custom-Essay.ws. Even the smartest students make mistakes and need professional assistance with essay perfection. We employ experienced editors and proofreaders who are able to help you with paper improvement. Editing and revision are offered for free to customers who order custom essay writing service. If you want to ensure high grade on your term paper or research essay, ask our editors for assistance!","According to the text, the main difference between essay editing and essay revising is that editing is about correcting mistakes, such as grammar, spelling, and punctuation, whereas revising is about making major changes to the writing, including adding or deleting material, to improve the overall paper.

In other words, editing is a more superficial process that focuses on refining the writing to make it error-free and polished, whereas revising is a more substantial process that involves rethinking and reorganizing the content to make it more effective and coherent.

The text also emphasizes the importance of leaving the writing aside for a few days before revising or editing, in order to approach it with a fresh eye and a clear mind. This allows the writer to see the paper with a more objective perspective and make more effective changes.

In contrast, editing is often done more quickly, with the writer focusing on specific aspects of the writing, such as grammar and punctuation, rather than taking a step back to evaluate the paper as a whole.","The assistant's response accurately summarizes the difference between essay editing and revising as presented in the user's text. The answer effectively distinguishes editing as primarily concerned with correcting surface-level issues, such as grammar and punctuation, while revising involves more significant changes to the content and structure of the essay. The assistant highlights the importance of revisiting the work with a fresh perspective, which aligns with the user's emphasis on setting aside the writing for a few days.

However, the response could be improved by providing more detailed information about specific activities involved in revising, such as reorganizing ideas and ensuring the clarity and cohesion of arguments. Additionally, the assistant's answer doesn't touch upon some of the additional advice given in the user's text about topics and thesis statements.

Overall, the assistant's answer is relevant and accurate but could benefit from deeper engagement with the details provided in the user's text, such as examples of revising activities and the importance of logical structure in an essay.

The assistant included creative and appealing dishes, leveraging familiar items like quinoa, sweet potatoes, and avocados in innovative ways. The suggestions were relevant, detailed enough to give an idea of how each dish would be composed, and they mentioned seasonal produce, aligning well with the context of a farmer’s market. 

However, while the list contains mostly relevant and well-thought-out dishes, it falls slightly short because the question specifically asked for a catalog of at least 10 dishes, and the response cuts off abruptly with the 9th dish, leaving the list incomplete. This oversight affects the completeness of the response, which is a crucial factor in evaluating its quality. Nevertheless, the individual dish descriptions are detailed and creative, showing a good use of seasonal and locally sourced produce.

Gold prices fell $8.42 an ounce yesterday, down for the second straight session to $1252.85, as expectations of further easing from the European Central Bank prompted some investors to take profits.","Based on the provided data, here's an analysis of the impact of central bank policies and global economic data on gold prices in recent weeks:

1. Federal Reserve's interest rate hike expectations: The possibility of an earlier-than-expected rise in U.S. interest rates has weighed heavily on gold prices, causing a 3.5% decline in the holiday-shortened week. Hawkish comments from Fed officials have also contributed to the decline.
2. European Central Bank's monetary policy: The ECB's decision to stand pat on policy has led to a decline in gold prices, as the dollar's strength against other currencies has weighed on the market.

* Week 5: Gold prices fell 2.64% as hawkish comments from Fed officials weighed on the market.

But make sure that it should be fresh and a bit tighter and harder. Add a little all purpose flour to it and make jamuns. The shop keeper who sold khoya to me revealed the trick of the trade, that they add milk powder also to it, to make more softer and tastier jamuns. So we added that also in it. Combine water, sugar and cardamom, mix till the sugar dissolves. Bring it to boil. Boil it for 8 to 10 mins. Make a thin syrup. Sugar particles should not stick to the vessel, this will the syrup crystallizes, once it cooled. Add cardamom, I added the seeds directly, not the powder of it. Combine khoya, all purpose flour and milk powder together. Mix well and make soft dough out of it. Do not knead. Make small and equal sized balls. While making them press gently between palms and make round shaped balls. Heat oil in a deep and thick bottomed kadai. Do not over heat. Simmer the stove and slowly drop each ball into it. Cook them in a low to medium flame, stirring occasionally. If we cook them on high flame, they turn into brown outside and won't cook inside. Cook them till they turn brown in color. They should get nice golden brown color. Remove them from heat and slowly immerse them in sugar syrup. Let the sugar syrup be warm, even if it cooled, warm it for 2 minutes.

The response covers several key aspects of the user's requirements, such as implementing the bubble sort, allowing input for the number of records, sorting both ascending and descending, and some basic error handling.

1. **Helpfulness and Relevance**: The response is mostly relevant and provides a direct implementation of bubble sort. However, the code currently has an issue with array handling. In Pascal, arrays need fixed bounds, and the procedure signature `BubbleSort(var arr: array of StudentRecord; ascending: boolean);` requires explicit bounds.

2. **Accuracy and Detail**: There is a critical error: the method to iterate over the array using `Length(arr)` is incorrect due to Pascal's static array requirement. The program will not compile because `Length` is used inappropriately for a static array. The assistant needs to better handle the array's declaration and access.

3. **Error Handling**: The program includes basic error handling for invalid input when entering the number of students and choice of sorting order. It successfully exits or halts on invalid inputs, but improvements could be made, such as re-prompting the user for input instead of terminating.

4. **Depth**: The response captures the primary functionality but misses dynamic error handling improvements, such as checking for valid grade inputs or using a dynamic data structure to handle more students than the pre-defined array size.

5. **Creativity**: The solution provided is straightforward without additional features or embellishments beyond the basic requirements.

Given these points, the response is functional but contains significant issues that prevent it from executing correctly. An understanding of required additional Pascal syntax or handling improvements would enhance the response.

The completion of only parts of Acts I and II does not meet the user's specific request for a 120-page screenplay. Despite this, the beginning provided is relevant and maintains some creativity, with character setup and initial narrative conflicts appropriate for the drama anticipated in a romantic comedy with suspenseful elements.

The creativity in character names and brief interactions adds a bit of personality and comedic potential. Little depth is provided beyond initial setup scenes, and there's no clear indication of how the Acts would unfold further. For a complete evaluation of a screenplay, more detail about character arcs, major plot points, climaxes, and resolutions would be necessary.

Jason Nisbit, 39, is facing a charge of second degree homicide with intent in the death of 26-year-old Chelsea Martinez. A friend said Martinez’s husband found she'd been on a social networking site and had an exchange of disturbing messages with a man in Minnesota. Investigators tracked the profile to Nisbit. In the messages, Martinez said she can't wait to die but expresses fear over the idea. The two discuss how Nisbit will do it. Martinez said she will finally be at peace and thanks him. Martinez's car and body were found near a Minnesota park last week. Police say Nisbit admitted to killing her and took them to the body. Nisbit told police the two met at the park then walked a ways to a wooded area, saying he ""knew there was water available if he needed to wash anything off."" In the complaint, Nisbit said he tied Martinez's hands and feet with a cord then strangled her with another cord. After she passed out, he says he cut her throat with a knife. The complaint goes on to say he dragged her body to a culvert and partially covered her with dirt. Family and friends said the young mother of three battled depression and other mental issues her whole life and had been suicidal in the past. Minnesota authorities said Nisbit has no criminal record, only a few minor traffic offenses. He will be back in court August 24. Bond was set at $1 million. What was the evidence that led investigators to track Jason Nisbit in connection to the disappearance and death of Chelsea Martinez?","According to the text, the evidence that led investigators to track Jason Nisbit in connection to the disappearance and death of Chelsea Martinez was an exchange of disturbing messages between Martinez and Nisbit on a social networking site.

**Comparison and Recommendation**

Based on the comparison above, I recommend using SlickText for the following reasons:

1. Cost-effectiveness: SlickText offers a more competitive pricing plan, with a flat rate of $25/month for 10,000 messages, compared to Twilio's per-message pricing.
2.","**Explanation:**

The assistant's response provides a structured comparison of three SMS marketing software options: SlickText, Twilio, and MessageBird. Here's an evaluation of the response considering various criteria:

- **Helpfulness and Relevance:** The response directly addresses the user's request for a comparative analysis of SMS marketing software with features like segmentation, automation, and CRM integration. It provides clear recommendations suitable for a team of 10, focusing on user-friendliness, cost, and reliability of analytics.

- **Accuracy:** The details provided about each software—pricing, features, and integration capabilities—are generally accurate, contributing to the reliability of the advice. However, more context about the specific needs or preferences of the team could refine accuracy.

- **Depth:** The response gives a reasonable level of detail for each option, highlighting key differences in pricing structure, interface usability, and analytics capabilities. It effectively outlines why SlickText might be the preferred choice but could improve by providing more depth or examples illustrating how these features directly benefit user scenarios.

- **Creativity:** The analysis is straightforward and factual. While it lacks creative flair, it compensates with clarity and factual content, which is typically more important in a comparative analysis. There could be additional creative comparisons, such as feature usage examples or potential drawbacks, which are not included here.

- **Level of Detail:** The response is quite detailed concerning pricing and features but ends abruptly in its recommendation of SlickText. Expanding on the reasoning why SlickText is chosen over the other options (or continuing with incomplete points) would improve the comprehensiveness and usefulness of the recommendation.

The assistant's response meets many of the requested criteria, but the unfinished conclusion and the need for slightly more in-depth explanations are areas that slightly diminish its overall effectiveness.

The assistant's answer effectively breaks down several distinct aspects of the program, providing a clear contrast with traditional MFA programs. It mentions the online format, absence of residency requirements, emphasis on writing craft, career focus, affordability, small class sizes, diverse faculty, publishing opportunities, and career services. This breadth of coverage is useful for someone assessing the program's features.

Moreover, the assistant concludes by briefly mentioning the variety of coursework offered and discusses career preparedness, aligning well with the user's query, which focused on coursework and career prospects.

However, the response could benefit from specific examples or comparisons with other MFA programs to give more context on how SNHU practically stands out. While it mentions several differences, it does not provide detailed comparisons or empirical evidence to back up some claims, like tuition affordability or the effectiveness of career services.

Overall, the response is helpful, relevant, accurate, and sufficiently detailed, but it could improve in specificity and contextual comparisons.

Here are some ways in which Barque ships influenced the cultures and societies of the regions where they were most prevalent:

1. Globalization and Trade: Barque ships played a crucial role in the globalization of trade, connecting distant regions and cultures. They facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures between Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas, shaping the course of global history.
2. Economic Development: Barque ships contributed to the economic development of regions by facilitating the transportation of goods, including textiles, spices, and other valuable commodities. This led to the growth of cities, the emergence of new industries, and the creation of jobs.
3. Cultural Exchange: Barque ships enabled the exchange of cultural practices, art, and architecture between regions. For example, European sailors and traders introduced new architectural styles, music, and art forms to the Americas, while Asian and African cultures influenced European art and architecture.
4. Imperialism and Colonialism: Barque ships were instrumental in the expansion of European empires, facilitating the colonization of new territories and the exploitation of natural resources. This had a profound impact on the cultures and societies of colonized regions, leading to the displacement of indigenous populations, the imposition of foreign languages and customs, and the suppression of local cultures.
5. Maritime Culture: Barque ships gave rise to a distinct maritime culture, characterized by a strong sense of community, camaraderie, and shared experiences among sailors and shipowners. This culture was shaped by the harsh conditions of life at sea, the reliance on the elements, and the need for cooperation and mutual support.
6. Navigation and Cartography: Barque ships required skilled navigators and cartographers to chart new routes and navigate treacherous waters. This led to significant advances in navigation and cartography, which had a lasting impact on the development of geography and exploration.
7. Shipbuilding and Engineering: The construction of Barque ships drove innovation in shipbuilding and engineering, leading to the development of new materials, designs, and technologies. This had a lasting impact on the maritime industry and the development of modern shipbuilding.
8. Social Hierarchy: Barque ships were","The assistant's response provides a well-rounded and comprehensive overview of the various ways Barque ships impacted cultures and societies over time. The response is structured methodically, outlining significant areas of influence such as trade, economic development, cultural exchange, imperialism, maritime culture, navigation, shipbuilding, and social hierarchy. These facets are explained clearly, underlining how Barques contributed to globalization and the spread of cultural influences.

It discusses economic, cultural, technological, and social impacts, covering both positive (e.g., trade and innovation) and negative (e.g., colonialism) aspects.

2. **Accuracy**: The information regarding the functions and impacts of Barque ships is historically accurate and reflects a sound understanding of their role during the 16th to 19th centuries.

3. **Depth and Detail**: The response provides a detailed discussion of each aspect but could benefit from more specific examples or case studies to illustrate each point further and to enhance understanding.

4. **Clarity and Organization**: The response is organized into clearly defined points, which makes it easy to follow. However, the abrupt ending suggests that the list was incomplete, which slightly detracts from the overall coherence.

5. **Creativity**: While the response is not particularly creative, it effectively utilizes a straightforward approach to convey the necessary information.

Include vivid descriptions of the eerie environment, Lily's internal struggle with fear, as well as her physical journey to find her way back to the entrance. End the story with a surprising plot twist that leaves readers with a haunting impression.","As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the harvest festival, Lily's excitement grew. She had always been fascinated by the local legend of the haunted corn maze, and tonight was the perfect opportunity to explore it. The air was crisp, carrying the sweet scent of ripe corn and the distant chatter of festival-goers. Lily's friends had warned her about the maze's reputation, but she was determined to face her fears.

As she entered the maze, the rustling of cornstalks beneath her feet seemed to whisper eerie tales. The path twisted and turned, leading her deeper into the labyrinth. Lily's heart raced with every step, her senses heightened as she navigated the darkness. The moon, now a silver crescent in the sky, cast an otherworldly glow, making the corn seem to writhe and twist around her.

Suddenly, a faint whisper echoed through the maze, sending shivers down Lily's spine. ""Get out while you still can."" The words seemed to come from all directions, making her skin crawl. Lily quickened her pace, her eyes scanning the path ahead. But the more she walked, the more disoriented she became. The corn seemed to close in around her, the rustling growing louder, like a chorus of restless spirits.

Panic set in as Lily realized she was lost. The darkness seemed to press in on her, making her breath come in short gasps. She stumbled, her foot catching on a hidden root. As she regained her balance, a figure loomed before her – a gaunt, spectral woman with sunken eyes and a twisted grin. Lily's scream was drowned out by the rustling corn as the woman vanished into thin air.

Lily's fear turned to desperation as she pushed forward, her eyes fixed on the distant moon. She stumbled, tripped, and fell, scraping her knee on a jagged rock. As she struggled to her feet, a cold breeze swept through the maze, extinguishing the moon's glow. Lily was plunged into total darkness.

Just as she thought all was lost, a faint light flickered to life ahead. Lily stumbled towards it, her heart pounding in her chest. As she emerged from the maze, she saw the festival lights twinkling in the distance. Exhausted and shaken, she stumbled towards the entrance, only to find it... locked.

A figure emerged from the shadows, its face twisted into a grotesque grin. ""You should have","The assistant's response exhibits many strengths in addressing the prompt. It sets the scene vividly, painting a compelling picture of the haunted corn maze with sensory details that help immerse the reader in Lily's journey. The eerie descriptions of the environment and supernatural elements add depth to the story, making it both engaging and atmospheric. Lily's internal struggle with fear is palpable, highlighted by her racing heart and desperate actions, aligning well with the suspenseful theme.

The narrative effectively builds tension, as seen through Lily's gradual disorientation and encounters with supernatural entities. This gradual build-up maintains reader interest and adheres to the request for a suspenseful short story. However, the response ends abruptly and does not provide the surprising plot twist or haunting conclusion that would fully satisfy the prompt's requirements. The assistant's story ends mid-sentence, which detracts from its overall completeness and impact.

Despite this, the assistant demonstrates creativity and provides a well-realized beginning and middle section of the story. The level of detail in describing Lily's experiences contributes positively to the narrative. Ultimately, the major drawback is the lack of a proper ending with the expected plot twist, which is critical to fulfilling the prompt's criteria.

The wall stretches for over 13,000 miles (21,000 km), making it one of the longest structures ever built.

The history of the Great Wall of China dates back to the 7th century BC, when several small states in the region built walls to protect themselves from nomadic tribes. The wall was continuously expanded and fortified by successive Chinese dynasties, including the Qin, Han, Sui, and Ming dynasties.

The most famous and well-preserved sections of the Great Wall were built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), which is why most tourists visit these sections. Here are some of the most popular sections for tourists:

1. Badaling Great Wall: This is the most visited and most well-known section of the Great Wall, located about 45 miles (72 km) northwest of Beijing. It was the first section to be opened to tourists in 1957 and has since become a symbol of China.
2. Mutianyu Great Wall: Located about 40 miles (64 km) northeast of Beijing, Mutianyu is a less crowded and more scenic section of the wall, with steep climbs and stunning views.
3. Jinshanling Great Wall: This section is located about 75 miles (120 km) northeast of Beijing and is known for its rugged terrain and scenic views. It's a popular spot for hikers and adventure seekers.
4. Simatai Great Wall: Located about 45 miles (72 km) northeast of Beijing, Simatai is a popular section for hikers and offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside.
5. Huangyaguan Great Wall: Located in Tianjin, about 100 miles (160 km) east of Beijing, Huangyaguan is a scenic section of the wall that offers stunning views of the Bohai Sea.

* The Gubeikou Great Wall, located about 60 miles (96 km) northeast of Beijing, which is known for its rugged terrain and scenic views.

When you want something sweet, it’s hard to resist the classic chocolate chip cookie. It’s sweet. It’s comforting. It’s loyal. It’s basically your BFF.
But, for those times you don’t want your BFF to be loaded with refined sugar, simple carbs, and unhealthy fats, you’re in luck because I gave your BFF a make-over! It’s pretty much the chocolate chip cookie of your dreams. These deep dish cookies are full of protein, low in fat, grain free, and low in sugar. No joke! A typical chocolate chip cookie has about 13 grams of sugar and 2 grams of protein. Howevah, these delicious treats have a whopping 8 grams of protein and a measly 2 grams of refined sugar!
And because I am with everything else in life, I am also indecisive about wanting a super chewy cookie or a really crispy one. So, if you needed another reason to love these deep dish cookies, you get the best of both worlds with them! They have a nice, crispy edge with a soft, chewy center. The trick to getting this combo is baking them in a muffin tin. Not only is it easy and convenient, but it also keeps the cookies from spreading out while baking, giving them the chewy center. And because the batter is touching the pan all the way around, you get a nice, crispy edge. It’s like the corner piece of a pan of brownies, but all around! Once again, it’s like unicorns invaded your dreams and made your wishes come true.
And whipping up these high protein treats couldn’t be any easier. As long as you’ve got a blender or food processor you’re in business, because we’re going to puree some chickpeas. Just trust me on this one. These little gems are going to give your cookies some texture, chewiness, and replaces the flour so the cookies are grain-free. Once you’ve got them pureed, all you need to do is mix the dry ingredients, stir together the wet ingredients, and then combine that all together.
Preheat the oven to 325 F. Grease a 12 cup muffin tin.
In a food processor or blender, puree the chickpeas with the water until smooth.
In a large bowl, add the coconut flour, protein powder, sweetener, baking powder and soda, and salt.
In a seperate bowl, combine the chickpea puree, egg, yogurt, milk, oil, and vanilla. Stir or whisk until fully combined.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until fully incorporated.
Evenly distribute the batter into the prepared muffin tins. It will be about 1.5 - 2 Tbsps of dough per cookie.
Smooth out the batter so batter touches the edges of the pan, but don't press/flatten the dough.
Bake for 14 min. or until the edges of the cookies turn golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cookie dough comes out clean.
Allow the cookies to cool completely in the pan.
Feel free to top with nut butter, jam, or more chocolate and eat 'em up!
Hi! This recipe sounds dreamy! Do you think I could replace the protein powder with oat flour? Based on the passage above, Can you provide a summary of the high protein chocolate chip cookie recipe, including the unique ingredient used to replace flour?","The recipe can be modified to replace protein powder with oat flour, but it's not recommended. The protein powder is used to provide a significant amount of protein to the cookies, whereas oat flour would not provide the same nutritional benefits.

As for the summary, here's a summary of the high protein chocolate chip cookie recipe:

The recipe uses chickpeas as a unique ingredient to replace flour, providing texture, chewiness, and making the cookies grain-free. The cookies are also low in fat, refined sugar, and have a whopping 8 grams of protein. To achieve the perfect combination of crispy edges and chewy centers, the cookies are baked in a muffin tin. The recipe is easy to make and requires only a blender or food processor to puree the chickpeas. The cookies can be topped with nut butter, jam, or more chocolate for added flavor and texture.","The assistant's response is quite effective in addressing the user's query. It provides a clear summary of the unique ingredient used (chickpeas) to replace flour in the high protein chocolate chip cookie recipe. The assistant also explains the nutritional role of protein powder in the original recipe and suggests that substituting it with oat flour would alter the nutritional profile by reducing protein content. This directly addresses the user's question about substitution, maintaining focus on the recipe's intent of being a high-protein treat. Additionally, the response is concise while capturing the key aspects of the recipe, such as the baking method (using a muffin tin) and suggestions for toppings, aligning with the user's interest in the recipe details.

However, the assistant could have expanded slightly on the impact this substitution might have on the texture or taste of the cookies, as well as noted potential adjustments in liquid content due to the difference in absorbency between protein powder and oat flour. These additional details could have added depth to the response.

Overall, while the response is helpful, relevant, and accurate in summarizing the recipe and the potential substitution, it could benefit from minor enhancements for improved depth and detail.

This program defines a function `bubble_sort_remove_duplicates`","In this evaluation, we are considering how well the AI assistant's response fulfills the user's request to create a bubble sort-based Python program that both sorts and removes duplicates.

**Helpfulness and Relevance**: The response is generally relevant to the user's request. It provides a Python function that sorts a list and removes duplicates, using a bubble sort-like method. However, it doesn’t implement the user's exact request to remove duplicates using bubble sort specifically. Bubble sort is traditionally for sorting, not removing duplicates, and this program sorts first then uses a new set of logic for duplicates.

**Accuracy**: The code provided is mostly accurate. It sorts the list using a bubble sort approach and removes duplicates by iterating through the sorted list. However, the removal of duplicates is done post-sort, not inherently part of the bubble sort process.

**Depth and Detail**: The code is well-commented, making it understandable as required for readability. The assistant checks for input errors such as non-list inputs or non-integer values in the list, conforming to the user's request for error handling. The code also includes type and value checks and raises appropriate exceptions with informative error messages.

**Creativity**: While the solution effectively sorts and removes duplicates, the ""bubble sort"" method to remove duplicates after sorting does not inherently align with a bubble sort algorithm, showing a lack of creative adaptation to blend two tasks. It employs a separate logic loop for handling duplicates instead of integrating duplicate-checking into the swap operations of the bubble sort process.

**Level of Detail**: The assistant provides comprehensive comments and fulfills the requirement for readability through descriptive variable naming and clear comment usage. Error handling is covered, and example usage is provided.

Overall, the response meets several elements of the user's request but deviates from applying bubble sort explicitly to the duplicate removal process, leading to a discrepancy in addressing the original problem statement correctly.

The program should implement the sorting algorithm in a function and display the sorted array as output. The program should handle the case of duplicate integers and empty arrays. Please use clear variable names and comments in your code.,"Here is a Lua program that sorts an array of integers in descending order using the built-in table.sort function:

```lua
-- Function to sort an array of integers in descending order
function sortDescending(arr)
    -- Check if the array is empty
    if #arr == 0 then
        print(""Array is empty"")
        return
    end

    -- Sort the array in descending order
    table.sort(arr, function(a, b) return a > b end)

    -- Print the sorted array
    for i, v in ipairs(arr) do
        print(v)
    end
end

-- Test the function
local arr = {5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 6, 4}
print(""Original array:"")
for i, v in ipairs(arr) do
    print(v)
end
print(""Sorted array in descending order:"")
sortDescending(arr)
```

This program defines a function called `sortDescending` that takes an array of integers as input and sorts it in descending order. The function first checks if the array is empty, and if so, it prints a message and returns. Then, it uses the built-in `table.sort` function to sort the array in descending order. The `table.sort` function takes two arguments: the array to be sorted, and a comparison function. The comparison function is used to determine the order of the elements in the array. In this case, the comparison function returns `true` if the first element is greater than the second element, which means the array is sorted in descending order.

Finally, the program tests the `sortDescending` function with an example array and prints the original and sorted arrays.

Note that this program uses the built-in `table.sort` function, which is a stable sort, meaning that it preserves the order of equal elements. This means that if there are duplicate integers in the array, they will be in the same order in the sorted array as they were in the original array.","The AI assistant's response effectively addresses the user's request by providing a Lua program that sorts an array of integers in descending order. The response demonstrates several strengths:

1. **Helpfulness and Relevance**: The response provides a complete solution to the task, offering a clear Lua script that meets the requirements specified by the user. It includes a function specifically for sorting arrays in descending order.

2. **Accuracy**: The use of `table.sort` with a custom comparison function `(a, b) return a > b end` is a correct and efficient method for sorting in descending order.

3. **Depth and Detail**: The assistant includes comments in the code to explain the functionality of each part, enhancing understanding for someone reading the program. Moreover, the explanation that follows gives insight into how the `table.sort` function works, focusing on the comparison function and its impact on the order.

4. **Error Handling**: The response addresses the edge case of an empty array by checking for it and printing a message. However, there's a minor inconsistency, as the request was to display a sorted array even when empty, rather than printing ""Array is empty"" and returning, yet it stays in line with the spirit of the user's requirements.

5. **Program Testing**: The inclusion of a test with sample data helps to illustrate the program's effectiveness and ensures easy verification of the function.

Overall, the assistant provides a well-structured and detailed answer that not only includes a working solution but also educates the user on how the sorting mechanism operates.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you install a new showerhead:

**Tools and Materials Needed:**

* New showerhead
* Adjustable wrench or basin wrench
* Channel-type pliers (optional)
* Teflon tape (optional)
* Shower arm or showerhead holder (if not included with the new showerhead)

**Step 1: Turn Off the Water Supply**

Before starting the installation, turn off the water supply to the shower by locating the shut-off valves behind the shower wall or under the sink. Turn the valves clockwise to shut off the water supply. Open the shower faucet to drain the water from the pipes.

**Step 2: Remove the Old Showerhead**

Use an adjustable wrench or basin wrench to loosen the old showerhead by turning it counterclockwise. Once loose, remove the old showerhead from the shower arm or showerhead holder.

**Step 3: Inspect and Clean the Shower Arm**

Make sure to include tips for achieving a caramelized crust on the steak without overcooking the inside. Use clear, concise language and provide visuals if possible to make the instructions easy to follow.","Cooking a perfectly seared steak can be a daunting task, but with these step-by-step instructions, you'll be on your way to a mouth-watering, caramelized crust on the outside and a tender, juicy interior.

**Step 1: Choose the Right Steak**

For a perfectly seared steak, you'll want to choose a high-quality cut with a good balance of marbling (fat distribution). Ribeye, strip loin, or filet mignon are excellent options. For this recipe, we'll use a 1.5-inch thick ribeye steak.

**Step 2: Season the Steak**

Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). In a small bowl, mix together 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. Rub the mixture all over the steak, making sure to coat it evenly.

**Step 3: Sear the Steak**

Heat a cast-iron or stainless steel skillet over high heat until it reaches 450°F (230°C). Yes, you read that right – high heat! You want to get a nice crust on the steak. Place the steak in the skillet and sear for 3-4 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the steak. You'll know it's ready when it develops a nice brown crust.

**Step 4: Finish Cooking the Steak**

After searing the steak, reduce the heat to medium-low (around 300°F or 150°C) and continue cooking it to your desired level of doneness. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature:

* Rare: 120°F - 130°F (49°C - 54°C)
* Medium-rare: 130°F - 135°F (54°C - 57°C)
* Medium: 140°F - 145°F (60°C - 63°C)

For a 1.5-inch thick ribeye, cook it for an additional 5-7 minutes after searing. For a more precise cooking time, use the following guidelines:

* Rare: 10-12 minutes total cooking time
* Medium-rare: 12-14 minutes total cooking time
* Medium: 14-16 minutes total cooking time

**Step 5: Rest the Steak**

Once the steak is cooked to your liking, remove it from the skillet and place it on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Let it rest","**Explanation:**

daf6ac54a9cfe7f23d031452747961d6e7935bdf4b1f82c1cbb7da3f72c4942f,"A James Cook University researcher has created a unique process to swiftly identify patients most at risk of dying from sepsis, a condition that claims the lives of more than 3000 Australians each year.
Sixth-year medical student, Satyen Hargovan’s honours research project has generated a check-list of the top 10 factors that influence the survival of sepsis patients.
Sepsis is a common medical condition, where chemicals released by the immune system to fight an infection trigger the inflammation and eventual shut-down of multiple organs.
Some 15,700 patients with sepsis are admitted to Australian Intensive Care Units every year. About one in five die. The cost of treating each case is more than $39,000.
“The burden of sepsis is not only in relation to patient outcomes, but also the financial cost to the healthcare system,” Mr Hargovan said.
His project, known as the Cairns Sepsis Model – 4 (CSM- 4) is designed to speed up the assessment of patients within their first four hours in ICU.
The new four-hour mortality prediction model will enable clinicians to detect patients who are at a higher risk of dying, then help to guide their treatment decisions and discussions with the patient and their family.
“Essentially it means that if a patient has a five percent chance of dying, you might treat them less invasively,” he said. “For example, you won’t rush to place them in an induced coma, or insert lines into large arteries or veins.
Mr Hargovan began his research by reviewing more than 50 mortality prediction studies, but soon realized that there was no model in the world specifically designed to predict mortality in adult sepsis patients within four hours of ICU admission.
A case history review of 500 adult sepsis patients admitted to the Cairns Hospital ICU over a four-year period identified 168 factors that could influence patient health outcomes, ranging from age, gender and socio-economic status to type of infection, degree of organ failure, vital signs, blood test results and treatment regimes.
Statistical analysis whittled the figure down to the 10 most significant factors, which include age, history of renal disease, level of consciousness, and abnormal levels of certain substances in the blood that represent varying degrees of organ dysfunction.
The mortality prediction model is inexpensive to use as it largely relies on information easily gleaned from patient history, physical examination, and blood tests that are routinely conducted on patients within their first four hours of admission to an ICU.
The next step involves testing his model on a different and larger set of patients in order to validate his research, before it can be accepted for clinical use.
“Then we’d love to create an online calculator or an app that clinicians can use easily, at the bedside, and have a result within seconds,” he said.

Associate Professor Alan de Costa. Dr de Costa will be available for interview on Tuesday in Cairns.
What are the potential benefits of using the mortality prediction model developed by Hargovan, and what is the next step in validating and implementing this model in clinical practice?","The potential benefits of using the mortality prediction model developed by Hargovan include:

* Enabling clinicians to detect patients who are at a higher risk of dying, allowing for more targeted and effective treatment decisions
* Guiding treatment decisions and discussions with patients and their families
* Potentially reducing the use of invasive treatments in patients with a low chance of survival
* Reducing the financial cost of treating sepsis patients, as the model can help identify patients who may not require intensive treatment

The next step in validating and implementing this model in clinical practice is to test it on a different and larger set of patients to validate the research. This will involve:

* Conducting a larger study to confirm the accuracy of the model
* Refining the model based on the results of the validation study
* Creating an online calculator or app that clinicians can use easily at the bedside
* Implementing the model in clinical practice, potentially through the development of clinical guidelines or protocols.","The assistant's response effectively addresses the question posed, providing a well-structured summary of the potential benefits of the Cairns Sepsis Model (CSM-4) and outlining the subsequent steps necessary for its validation and implementation in clinical practice.

**Helpfulness and Relevance:** The response directly answers the user's question by listing the key benefits of the model and identifying the necessary next steps for further validation and practical application. The information aligns well with the details provided in the prompt.

**Accuracy:** The assistant accurately captures the intended advantages of the model, such as improving patient risk assessment, informing treatment decisions, and possibly reducing healthcare costs. It also correctly mentions the requirement for additional validation with a larger patient set, as highlighted in the original description of Satyen Hargovan's research.

**Depth and Detail:** While the assistant gives a concise overview, it could expand further on how these benefits might specifically impact patient care and healthcare systems. Additionally, mentioning specific factors from the model or explaining how it differs from existing models could provide more depth.

**Creativity:** The response lacks creativity but remains focused and factual, staying true to the informative nature of the inquiry.

**Overall Evaluation:** The assistant's response is succinct, well-organized, and informative, but it could include more detail to enrich the understanding of the model's implications and innovations.

Incorporate at least three sensory details (sight, smell, sound, touch, taste) to enhance your descriptions. Use your imagination and make your entry vivid for the reader.","Whisker's Diary - Entry 345

Today was a purr-fect day. I woke up to the warm rays of sunlight streaming through the window, casting a golden glow on my plush fur. I stretched my sleek body, arching my back and extending my claws, giving a good yawn to signal the start of my day. The scent of fresh coffee wafted from the kitchen, enticing me to explore.

As I padded across the floor, my ears perked up at the sound of birds chirping outside. I love listening to their melodic songs, and today was no exception. The sweet aroma of blooming flowers in the garden wafted in, mingling with the earthy scent of damp soil. My whiskers twitched as I sniffed the air, trying to pinpoint the source of the tantalizing smells.

I spotted a fly buzzing around the kitchen counter, and my hunting instincts kicked in. I stalked my prey, my tail twitching with excitement. With lightning-fast reflexes, I pounced, catching the fly in mid-air. The crunch of its tiny body between my teeth was music to my ears. I savored the taste of victory, my tongue licking my lips in satisfaction.

After my snack, I decided to take a leisurely stroll around the house. The soft carpet beneath my paws was a delight, and I reveled in the sensation of the fibers tickling my toes. I padded into the living room, where the warm glow of the lamp cast a cozy ambiance. The soft hum of the TV in the background provided a soothing background noise, and I curled up on the couch, feeling the plush cushions envelop me.

As the day wore on, I grew sleepy, and I curled up in my favorite spot on the windowsill. The sun's rays warmed my fur, and I felt my eyelids growing heavy. I drifted off to sleep, lulled by the gentle rustling of the leaves outside and the distant rumble of the neighbors' lawnmower.

As I slept, I dreamed of chasing butterflies and exploring the great outdoors. When I woke up, I was refreshed and ready to take on the world. Or at least, the kitchen. I padded back to the kitchen, where I found my human preparing dinner. The savory aroma of roasting chicken wafted through the air, making my mouth water. I meowed loudly, demanding attention and, of course, a taste of the delicious","The AI's response to the user's request for a creative diary entry from the perspective of a cat is commendable in several aspects. The entry effectively uses sensory details, integrating sight (""golden glow,"" ""blooming flowers""), smell (""scent of fresh coffee,"" ""savory aroma of roasting chicken""), sound (""birds chirping,"" ""hum of the TV""), touch (""soft carpet,"" ""plush cushions""), and taste (""crunch of its tiny body,"" ""taste of victory"") to create a vivid and immersive narrative. These elements contribute to an engaging and dynamic description of the cat's day.

The response also demonstrates a fair level of character development for the cat. The description of the cat's activities and preferences (enjoyment of sunlight, interest in hunting, liking for cozy environments) provides insight into the cat's personality. The narrative captures the whimsical and instinctive nature of a cat's perspective, adding a layer of creativity to the entry.

However, while the response is detailed and includes specific sensory experiences, there could be more depth in exploring the cat's internal monologue or emotional reactions to make it more engaging. The sense of contentment is clearly conveyed, but exploring conflicted feelings or desires could add more to the character's complexity and development.

Overall, the response is highly relevant, creative, and effectively meets the criteria outlined in the user's request. A bit more complexity in the emotional or reflective narrative might make it even richer.

d2ede617a966d65a36bba1fa47b46bcf3b63a1803ac589ec9b85f9eba96a5e29,"Add eggs to these homemade dog cookies! I love this recipe and my 2 boxers, Ben and Emmy, love it more! I am making it weekly because they love it so much. The recipe is fabulous, but needed some tweaks. I doubled the recipe and added 2 eggs, used organic brown rice flour in place of wheat, and substituted 1/2 tsp garlic powder and hot water for the chicken broth. The cookies keep well in the fridge. I made these for my Yorkie/Rat Terrier mix and when they came out of the oven his tail was wagging just from the smell. He LOVES them. What can I substitute for the cheese in this dog treat recipe? I don't feed my dog cheese (let's be honest--it's basically junk food that doesn't belong in an adult dog's diet). Is there anything that you recommend substituting the cheese with? Or can I just leave it out? You could substitute the cheese for an 1/8 cup of ground flax or wheat bran. Is there something else I could use besides oats and wheat flour for this recipe? Chef's Comments ~ That's a great question. You can easily substitute the flour in this and most of our dog treat recipes. A few good grain free flours include almond flour, chickpea flour, potato flour and soy flour. Most of those flours should be available at a major grocery store. As far as substituting the oats, that's a little trickier, but it can be done. The oats are in the recipe for texture and soaking up moisture, so that's what you'll need to replace. First, you will want to halve the amount of oats and add an extra 1/2 cup of flour (or a mixture of the previously mentioned flours). Then you can add a 1/2 cup combination of unsweetened coconut, chopped peanuts and crumbled almond crackers. Or, you could replace all of the oats with the flour mixture. Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? If so, does it still need to be microwaved? Chef's Answer ~ That's a great question! :) I haven't tried this recipe with fresh spinach, but I don't see why it couldn't work. If you minced the spinach very fine, my guess is that you would not need to microwave, or otherwise cook, the spinach before adding it to the dog treat dough. Comments for Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? Is it necessary to store these cookies in a Refrigerator? Since these are cookies, can it be kept in air tight container outside? And how long would it last if this is done? Chef's Comments ~ You can get lots of tips on How to Store Dog Treats on my website. Unless you live in a very cold climate, most dog treats need to be kept indoors, and even better in the refrigerator. My dogs is algeric to grain. What can I use instead of the whole whear flour? My Husky can't have grain. What can I use besides whole wheat flour. You should put more recipes with no grain in them. Chef's Answer ~ You can replace the wheat flour in most of my dog treat recipes with a non-grain flour. For example, any type of bean flour like Chick Pea (Garbanzo Bean) flour, or ""flours"" from nuts. They are technically nut meals, but they work as flour, for example almond meal. You should be able to find grain free flours at specialty grocery stores, or at health food stores. Very good simple recipe, however wheat flour isn't something I would normally have in my cupboard. Would it be ok to use plain flour or self raising? Chef's Answer ~ Yes, you can use all purpose flour in place of the whole wheat flour. I do not recommend using self-rising flour because it has the addition of baking powder or baking soda added to it. These are things that homemade dog treats do not need. Can fresh/raw spinach be used in place of frozen spinach in a particular dog treat recipe, and does it need to be cooked beforehand?",You can substitute the cheese with an 1/8 cup of ground flax or wheat bran.,"The assistant’s response is very limited and addresses only one small part of the original question. The user's inquiry included various components about modifying a dog treat recipe—substituting cheese, finding alternatives to oats and wheat flour, using fresh spinach, and storage suggestions. The response solely focuses on substituting cheese with ground flax or wheat bran, which matches the user's question, but it neglects to consider the rest of the multifaceted query.

The response lacks depth and detail compared to the user’s extended requirements and complexities discussed in the question. It does not adequately engage with other aspects such as potential flour alternatives, oat replacements, adjustments for raw spinach, or storage advice. Additionally, the response does not show creativity or provide insight beyond the specific substitution for cheese.

For a more helpful response, the assistant could have:
1. Acknowledged and addressed multiple parts of the query.
2. Provided detailed alternatives for grains and oats.
3. Offered insights on using fresh spinach and whether pre-cooking is necessary.
4. Discussed proper storage methods for dog treats.

Overall, the response is too narrow in scope to be considered helpful or comprehensive for the user's needs and inquiries.

1d1e9cd863eba017753a34efdf9406e4fff191f6d30e54d8bec3f40c2d0f2eff,"Can you summarize Onur Unal's career path and main clients as an art director?
Generate according to: Onur Unal is Senior Art Director at Propaganda Advertising Agency in Istanbul.
It all started back in my childhood, I always interested in drawing doodles, reading comics and creating characters. I was inspired by humour magazines, and I was dreaming of become a caricature artist. I took courses on drawing technics, and after graduating from high school, I studied Graphic Design at Marmara University Fine Arts Faculty in Istanbul, Turkey.
During school, I got interested in advertising, and started an internship at Mullen Lowe Istanbul and TBWA Istanbul to practice on creative thinking and art direction. After that, I started to work for Big34, and a year after I accepted for Manajans/JWT. It was the most important years of my career.
I worked on important advertising campaigns of global clients, and won national and international advertising awards as Crystal Apple, Cannes Lions. I’m currently working for Propaganda Advertising Agency, and continue to design creative ideas for our clients.
I work for advertising agencies as an art director since 2009. I work for global and local clients as Nokia, Elidor/Sunsilk, Bosch, Shell, Turkcell, Mazda, Kia, Turkish Airlines, Hyundai, Nestle, Beko, Michelin, BMW, Red Bull, Mitsubishi Electric, Bayer, etc. I work mostly full-time at the office, and these days I also design mobile games with a freelance team.
I learnt that I should keep learning. As the technology and the design trends develop day by day, designers should stay updated. Last year I attended a design week about UX and digital design in London to learn more about digital design principles. During the week, I attended workshops at the design offices, and met designers from all over the world. It was a great experience to compare myself, and now I have new targets for my career.
I always try to find an exciting idea to get inspired. It can be anything – an interesting visual, a strong speech, a good music, anything. To find it, I make a quick research, take some notes and draw sketches. After, I brainstorm with our creative team and we share our ideas. Then the design process starts, I put on my headphones and focus on the design. After designing many alternatives, we make a discussion with our creative team and choose the best one.
The main materials I use are a blank sheet, a pen and creative thinking. All other tools and computer programs help to complete the final process.
Currently I work for Propaganda Advertising Agency. We have a beautiful office at the center of Istanbul with a nice view. I usually go to work around 9:30 am, have my breakfast while reading the news and after that the work begins. I work with a copywriter, and our team lead by a creative director. We usually make meetings at the beginning of the week with our brand executives, and we make a schedule for the deadlines. I usually work until 6:00 – 7:00 pm during the week, but under curtain some circumstances, we work overtimes and also weekends.
As my carreer began, I mostly worked on advertising campaigns, print materials, 360 ideas and digital advertising. Recently, I have been interested in UI, UX and digital design, and want to combine my creative background on advertising with the innovative projects.
During my short study in London last year, I had the chance to work and share my ideas with the designers all over the world, and I discovered things that I had never seen before.
I always believe that a designer should be in contact with all other designers and I want to cross the borders and surround myself with creative people around the world in my own studio.
