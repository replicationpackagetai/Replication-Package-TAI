It is a hearty and flavorful soup made with pork ribs, various vegetables, and a rich broth. Here's a simple recipe to make Bak Kut Teh at home:

Ingredients:

* 2 pounds pork ribs
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 inches ginger, sliced
* 2 stalks lemongrass, bruised
* 2 kaffir lime leaves
* 2 cups water
* 2 cups pork or chicken stock
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons oyster sauce (optional)
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon ground white pepper
* 2 tablespoons chopped scallions, for garnish
* 2 tablespoons fried shallots, for garnish

Instructions:

1. In a large pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the garlic, ginger, lemongrass, and kaffir lime leaves. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
2. Add the pork ribs and cook until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the water, stock, soy sauce, oyster sauce (if using), sugar, and white pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, or until the pork is tender.
4. Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool slightly. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean pot, discarding the solids.
5. Bring the broth to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes.
6. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.
7. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with scallions and fried shallots. Serve hot.

Note: You can also add other ingredients to the soup, such as mushrooms, bok choy, or noodles, to make it more substantial. Additionally, you can use pork bones or pork neck bones instead of ribs for a richer broth."

Here are some common reasons why you might encounter a 404 error when running `docker-compose up`:

1. Docker Compose file not found: Make sure that you are in the correct directory where your Docker Compose file is located. The file should be named `docker-compose.yml` or `docker-compose.yaml`. If the file is not in the current directory, you can specify the path to the file using the `-f` or `--file` option, for example: `docker-compose -f /path/to/docker-compose.yml up`.
2. Docker image not found: The Docker image specified in the Docker Compose file might not exist or might not be available in your Docker registry. Check the Docker image name and tag in your Docker Compose file to ensure that it is correct. You can also try to pull the image manually using `docker pull` command before running `docker-compose up`.
3. Docker Compose version issue: Make sure that you are using a compatible version of Docker Compose. You can check the version of Docker Compose by running `docker-compose --version`. If you are using an older version, you might need to upgrade to the latest version.
4. Docker daemon not running: The Docker daemon should be running in the background for Docker Compose to work. You can check if the Docker daemon is running by running `docker info` command. If the daemon is not running, you can start it by running `dockerd` command.
5. Network issue: Sometimes, a network issue can cause a 404 error when running `docker-compose up`. Try restarting your Docker daemon or checking your network connection.

If none of these solutions work, you can try to troubleshoot the issue by checking the Docker Compose logs for more information about the error. You can do this by running `docker-compose up --verbose` command, which will provide more detailed logs about the error."

While plants can certainly help purify the air, the number of plants you need will depend on several factors, such as the size of your space, the type of plants you choose, and the level of air pollution in your area.

Here are some general guidelines to consider:

* A small space (less than 100 square feet): 1-2 plants
* A medium space (100-200 square feet): 2-3 plants
* A large space (200-400 square feet): 3-5 plants

It's also important to choose plants that are known to be effective at purifying the air. Some popular options include:

* Spider plants
* Peace lilies
* Snake plants
* Dracaena
* Philodendron

Remember to research the specific needs of each plant, including lighting, watering, and temperature requirements, to ensure they thrive in your closet office.

Additionally, consider using an air purifier to supplement the air-purifying effects of your plants. These devices can help remove pollutants and allergens from the air, creating a healthier environment for you to work in.

I hope this information helps you get started on creating a clean and healthy workspace!"

canvas.addEventListener('touchend', function(event) {

```

This program creates a canvas element and sets its dimensions to 400x400 pixels. It then sets up event listeners for mouse and touch events, allowing users to draw on the canvas by moving their mouse or finger across the screen. The drawing is stored in the canvas's context, which is updated with each mouse or touch event.

To use this program, simply add the following HTML code to your page:

```html
<canvas id=""canvas""></canvas>
```

This will create a canvas element with the ID ""canvas"" that can be used to draw on. You can then use the JavaScript program above to enable drawing on the canvas."

        <input type=""submit"" value=""Upload"">
    </form>
    <?php

```

This code checks if the form has been submitted, and if so, it gets the uploaded file and checks if it's an image. If it is, it moves the file to the uploads directory and displays a success message. If the file is not an image, it displays an error message. If the form hasn't been submitted, it displays the form.

Please note that this is a basic example and you should add more error checking and security measures to your code."

Moreover, could you share a Ruby script capable of producing a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table?","To create a comprehensive comparison chart in HTML table format between traditional education and online education, you can use Ruby code to generate the table. Here's a sample Ruby script that creates a table with the specified columns and data:
```ruby
# Define the table headers
headers = [""Aspect"", ""Traditional Education"", ""Online Education""]

# Define the table data
data = [
  [""Cost"", ""High"", ""Low""],
  [""Flexibility"", ""Limited"", ""High""],
  [""Interaction"", ""Face-to-face"", ""Asynchronous""],
  [""Resources"", ""Limited"", ""Access to global resources""],
  [""Learning Outcomes"", ""Variable"", ""Variable""]
]

# Create the table
table = ""<table>""
table += ""<tr>""
headers.each do |header|
  table += ""<th>#{header}</th>""
end
table += ""</tr>""
data.each do |row|
  table += ""<tr>""
  row.each do |cell|
    table += ""<td>#{cell}</td>""
  end
  table += ""</tr>""
end
table += ""</table>""

# Print the table
puts table
```
This script defines the table headers and data, and then creates the table using HTML tags. The table has five rows, each representing an aspect of education, and two columns, one for traditional education and one for online education. The data is filled in based on the specified values.

To create a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table, you can use a Ruby library such as `gnuplot` or `ruby-plot`. Here's a sample Ruby script that uses `gnuplot` to create a bar graph:
```ruby
# Define the data for the graph
data = [
  [""Traditional Education"", 3],
  [""Online Education"", 2]
]

# Define the graph settings
settings = {
  ""title"" => ""Comparison of Traditional and Online Education"",
  ""x-axis"" => ""Education Model"",
  ""y-axis"" => ""Score"",
  ""bar_width"" => 0.5
}

# Create the graph
gnuplot = Gnuplot.new
gnuplot.set_title(settings[""title""])
gnuplot.set_x_axis(settings[""x-axis""])

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]

The third list has -26, -3, 32, 1 as even numbers so the third output is 0. The fourth list has -3, 20, -14, -38 for odd integers so the fourth output is 0. The fifth list has -20, -26, -30, -46, -49 for odd integers so the fifth output is 0. The sixth list has -19, 28, -39 for odd integers so the sixth output is 0. The seventh list has 43, 8 for odd integers so the seventh output is 0. The eighth list has -44, -16, 29 for odd integers so the eighth output is 0. The ninth list has -50, -5, 30, -49 for odd integers so the ninth output is 0. The tenth list has -11, 3, 27, 34, -45 for odd integers so the tenth output is 0. The eleventh list has 23, -44, -39 for odd integers so the eleventh output is 0. The twelfth list has 10, 39, 39 for odd integers so the twelfth output is 0."

This can lead to a range of health problems, including malnutrition, fatigue, and decreased immune function. In extreme cases, it can also lead to organ damage and even death. It's important to note that a body fat percentage of 16% is considered very low and is not a healthy or sustainable goal for most women. It's important to focus on maintaining a healthy weight and body composition through a balanced diet and regular exercise, rather than trying to achieve an extreme body fat percentage."

20. What's is the sum of the squares of all factors of 210?","To solve this problem, we need to find all the factors of 210 and then calculate the sum of their squares. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Find all the factors of 210:

Factors of 210: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, 210

2. Calculate the sum of the squares of all factors:

Sum of squares of factors = (1^2) + (2^2) + (3^2) + (5^2) + (6^2) + (7^2) + (10^2) + (14^2) + (15^2) + (21^2) + (30^2) + (35^2) + (42^2) + (70^2) + (105^2) + (210^2)

Here are the bullet points and table you requested:

**Perfect Market Elements and Healthcare Market Failures**

* **Perfect Competition**: Multiple firms producing a homogeneous product, free entry and exit, and perfect information.
	+ Example: Perfect competition in the healthcare market would mean multiple hospitals and clinics offering the same services, with no barriers to entry or exit, and complete transparency about prices and quality.
	+ Healthcare market failure: The healthcare market fails to achieve perfect competition due to barriers to entry, such as high capital costs and regulatory hurdles, which limit the number of providers and create monopolies.
* **Monopoly**: A single firm producing a homogeneous product, barriers to entry, and imperfect information.
	+ Example: A single hospital or clinic dominating the market and setting prices without competition.
	+ Healthcare market failure: The healthcare market fails to achieve monopoly due to the presence of multiple providers, which creates competition and drives prices down.

However, the `ParentName` property is not a standard property in Luau. If you need to get the name of the parent object, you can use the `Name` property of the parent object.

Here's an example:
```lua
local obj = Instance.new(""Part"")
obj.Parent = game.Workspace
print(obj.Parent.Name) -- prints the name of the parent object
```
In this example, `obj.Parent` returns the parent object of `obj`, which is `game.Workspace`. The `Name` property of `game.Workspace` is then printed to the console.

Note that the `ParentName` property is not a standard property in Luau, so you cannot use it directly. However, you can use the `Parent` property to access the parent object and then use the `Name` property to get the name of the parent object."

This is achieved by creating a special file called ""sudoers"" in the /etc directory, which contains a list of users and commands that can be executed without a password.

To use passwordless sudo in Linux, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the /etc directory.
2. Create a new file called ""sudoers"" using the command ""sudo nano /etc/sudoers"".
3. Add the following lines to the file:
```
# Allow members of the wheel group to execute any command
%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
4. Save the file and exit the editor.
5. Add the user you want to grant passwordless sudo access to the wheel group using the command ""sudo usermod -aG wheel <username>"".
6. Log out and log back in to apply the changes.

Now, when you run a command with the ""sudo"" prefix, you will not be prompted for a password. For example:
```
sudo apt-get update
```
Note that this feature should be used with caution, as it allows users to execute any command with superuser privileges without a password. It is recommended to only grant passwordless sudo access to trusted users and to regularly review the sudoers file to ensure that it is secure."

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy shrank by 20.4% in the second quarter of 2020, with the construction sector experiencing the largest fall at 41.5%. The country's GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown, which began at the end of March."

The ""="" symbol is not a special character in regular expressions, so it can be used as a literal character without any special treatment.

However, if you want to match the ""="" symbol as a literal character in a regular expression, you can use the ""\="" escape sequence. This will match the ""="" symbol as a literal character, rather than as a special character.

For example, the regular expression ""\="" will match the ""="" symbol as a literal character, while the regular expression ""="" will match any character that is equal to the ""="" symbol.

It's worth noting that the ""="" symbol is not a special character in regular expressions, so you don't need to escape it unless you want to match it as a literal character."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel recently made a statement about Donald Trump playing golf more than any other president and connected it to his critique of Trump's accomplishments.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

The cabin is surrounded by tall trees that stretch towards the sky, their leaves rustling softly in the gentle breeze. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the sound of birds singing their morning songs.

The cabin itself is made of natural wood, with a rustic charm that invites you to come in and stay a while. The door creaks as you open it, revealing a warm and inviting interior. The walls are adorned with colorful tapestries and the fireplace crackles with a warm, golden light.

The cabin is filled with all the comforts of home, from plush couches to a fully-equipped kitchen. But it's the little touches that make it truly special. There's a bookshelf filled with favorite novels, a guitar leaning against the wall, and a collection of photographs that tell the story of the cabin's history.

The cabin is a place where you can escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life and find peace and tranquility. It's a place where you can relax and unwind, surrounded by nature's beauty and the warmth of a crackling fire. It's a place that makes me happy, and I'm grateful to have it as a part of my life."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

The most important issue threatening all life on earth is climate change. Climate change is a global problem that is caused by the increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide, which is released through human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and land-use changes. This increase in greenhouse gases traps heat in the atmosphere, leading to rising temperatures and altering the Earth's climate.

Climate change has severe consequences, including more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and storms, as well as rising sea levels and melting of glaciers and polar ice caps. It also has significant impacts on ecosystems, biodiversity, and human health, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the poor, the elderly, and children.

It's important to note that climate change is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive and collaborative approach to address. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, protecting and restoring natural ecosystems, and promoting sustainable land-use practices.

The model should employ advanced natural language processing techniques, such as entity recognition and semantic analysis, to enhance its ability to detect subtle nuances in language and provide more accurate predictions. Additionally, the model should be trained on a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages to ensure its robustness and generalizability.","To develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately differentiate positive and negative emotions expressed in textual content, you can follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages. This will help the model learn to recognize patterns and nuances in different contexts and languages. You can use publicly available datasets like IMDB, Yelp, or Twitter, or create your own dataset by collecting text samples from various sources.

2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data by removing punctuation, converting all text to lowercase, and tokenizing the text into individual words or phrases. You can also remove stop words, which are common words like ""the,"" ""and,"" ""a,"" etc. that do not carry much meaning in the context of sentiment analysis.

3. **Entity Recognition**: Use entity recognition techniques to identify specific entities like people, organizations, locations, and dates in the text. This can help the model understand the context and sentiment behind the text. You can use libraries like spaCy or Stanford CoreNLP for entity recognition.

4. **Semantic Analysis**: Use semantic analysis techniques to understand the meaning and relationships between words in the text. This can help the model identify subtle nuances in language and provide more accurate predictions. You can use libraries like Word2Vec or GloVe for semantic analysis.

5. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model on the preprocessed and analyzed data. You can use a supervised learning approach, where the model is trained on labeled data (i.e., text with corresponding sentiment labels). You can use a deep learning approach, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a convolutional neural network (CNN), or a traditional machine learning approach, such as a support vector machine (SVM) or a random forest.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model on a test dataset. You can use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance. You can also use techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.

7. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model in a production environment, where it can be used to analyze new text data and provide sentiment predictions. You can use a web application, a mobile app, or a command-line interface to deploy the model.

Here's a sample code in Python using the spaCy library for entity recognition and the Word2Vec library for semantic analysis:

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"You can use the Base64 encoding algorithm to encode your string. Here's an example of how you can do it in JavaScript:

```javascript
const originalString = ""This is a long string that needs to be encoded."";
const encodedString = btoa(originalString);

console.log(encodedString);
```

In this example, the `btoa()` function is used to encode the string into a Base64 encoded string. The `btoa()` function is a built-in JavaScript function that converts a string into a Base64 encoded string.

To decode the string, you can use the `atob()` function:

```javascript
const decodedString = atob(encodedString);

console.log(decodedString);
```

The `atob()` function is the reverse of the `btoa()` function. It takes a Base64 encoded string and converts it back into a regular string.

Here's the full code:

```javascript
const originalString = ""This is a long string that needs to be encoded."";
const encodedString = btoa(originalString);
const decodedString = atob(encodedString);

console.log(""Original String:"", originalString);
console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);
console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);
```

This code will output the original string, the encoded string, and the decoded string."

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node using Heuristic search, we can use the A* algorithm. The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding algorithm that combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy search.

First, we need to define the heuristic function. The heuristic function should estimate the distance from the current node to the goal node. In this case, we can use the Manhattan distance as the heuristic function, which is the sum of the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates between the current node and the goal node.

Next, we need to define the cost function. The cost function should estimate the cost of moving from the current node to the goal node. In this case, we can use the cost of moving one cell as the cost function.

Now, we can implement the A* algorithm. We start at the starting node (1,1) and explore the neighbors of each node in the order of their estimated total cost (heuristic function + cost function). We keep track of the node with the lowest estimated total cost and move to that node. We repeat this process until we reach the goal node.

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.

Tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink:

* Dry shake first: This helps to emulsify the egg white and creates a better texture.
* Add cream last: This helps to prevent the cream from getting too cold and prevents the drink from becoming too thick.
* Strain into a glass from up high: This helps to create a nice, even layer of foam on top of the drink.
* Use smaller ice cubes: This helps to create smaller bubbles and a more even texture.

Who they are and why they are in conflict.,"Character 1: Alex, a successful businesswoman in her late 30s, who has built her career on her intelligence, determination, and strong work ethic. She is a perfectionist and has a strong sense of responsibility, which often leads her to take on too much and neglect her own well-being.

Character 2: Jamie, a free-spirited artist in his mid-30s, who has always followed his heart and pursued his passions, even if it means taking risks and facing uncertainty. He is a creative and spontaneous person who values freedom and autonomy above all else.

The conflict between Alex and Jamie arises from their fundamentally different approaches to life. Alex sees Jamie's carefree nature as irresponsible and reckless, while Jamie views Alex's rigid adherence to routine and structure as stifling and unfulfilling. They both believe that their way of living is the only way to achieve true happiness and fulfillment, and they are unwilling to compromise or understand each other's perspectives.

As a result, their relationship becomes strained, and they begin to drift apart. Alex feels frustrated and disappointed by Jamie's lack of ambition and responsibility, while Jamie feels suffocated by Alex's constant need for control and order. They both struggle to find common ground and understand each other's needs and desires, leading to a deepening sense of conflict and disconnection.

Despite their differences, both Alex and Jamie are good people who genuinely care about each other. They are both searching for a deeper connection and a sense of purpose in their lives, but their conflicting values and approaches to life make it difficult for them to find common ground and move forward together."

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","Congham Hall Hotel stands out from other hotels in the area due to its unique ambiance and dining options.

Tabanus is a genus of flies that includes over 1,000 species, and their flight patterns can vary depending on the species, climate, and geography of the region.

Some species of Tabanus are migratory, while others are non-migratory. Migratory Tabanus species tend to fly long distances between their breeding and feeding grounds, while non-migratory species tend to stay within a smaller area.

In general, Tabanus flies tend to fly at lower altitudes than other insects, typically between 10-100 meters above the ground. They are attracted to warm, sunny areas and tend to fly in a zigzag pattern as they search for food.

In different regions, the flight patterns of Tabanus can vary depending on the local climate and geography. For example, in tropical regions, Tabanus flies tend to be more active during the day and tend to fly higher altitudes than in temperate regions. In arctic regions, Tabanus flies tend to be more active during the summer months and tend to fly lower altitudes than in temperate regions.

It's worth noting that the flight patterns of Tabanus can also vary depending on the time of year and the availability of food. For example, during times of drought or food scarcity, Tabanus flies may be more active during the day and may fly higher altitudes in search of food.

Overall, the flight patterns of Tabanus can vary depending on a variety of factors, including the species, climate, and geography of the region."

Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex.

 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
