When you encounter a 404 error while running `docker-compose up`, it could be due to several reasons. Here are some common causes and troubleshooting steps:

1. **Incorrect Service Name**:
   - Ensure that the service name you are trying to start exists in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     services:
       web:
         image: nginx
     ```

2. **Incorrect Command**:
   - Double-check the command you are using. The correct command is `docker-compose up` (without any service name unless you want to start only a specific service).
   - Example:
     ```sh
     docker-compose up
     ```

3. **File Path**:
   - Ensure that the `docker-compose.yml` file is in the correct directory or provide the full path to the file.
   - Example:
     ```sh
     docker-compose -f /path/to/docker-compose.yml up
     ```

4. **Service Configuration**:
   - Check the configuration of the service in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Ensure that the service is properly defined and that there are no typos or missing required fields.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     services:
       web:
         image: nginx
         ports:
           - ""80:80""
     ```

5. **Network Issues**:
   - Ensure that the service is running and accessible. Sometimes, the service might not be running or might not be exposed correctly.
   - You can use `docker ps` to check if the containers are running.

6. **Logs**:
   - Check the logs for more detailed information about what might be going wrong.
   - Example:
     ```sh
     docker-compose up --no-start -d && docker-compose ps
     docker-compose logs
     ```

7. **Dependencies**:
   - Ensure that all dependencies required by the service are properly defined and available.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     services:
       web:
         image: nginx
         depends_on:
           db:
             condition: service_healthy
         ports:
           - ""80:80""
       db:
         image: postgres
     ```

8. **Permissions**:
   - Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to run Docker commands.

This metaphor conveys the author's sense of isolation and desolation. The image of a ""ruined fort"" suggests a sense of decay, abandonment, and loss. The word ""inaccessible"" further emphasizes the author's feeling of being cut off from others or from a better state of being. Overall, this opening line sets a tone of melancholy and frustration, hinting at the author's emotional state of feeling trapped and disconnected."

Here are some guidelines to help you determine how many plants you need:

1. **Space Size**: Measure the square footage of your closet office. A general rule of thumb is to have one large plant or several small plants for every 100 square feet (9.3 square meters) of space.

2. **Types of Plants**: Some plants are more effective at removing certain pollutants. Commonly recommended plants include:
   - **Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)**: Good for removing formaldehyde and xylene.
   - **Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)**: Effective at removing formaldehyde, xylene, and trichloroethylene.
   - **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)**: Good for removing benzene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, xylene, and ammonia.
   - **Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica)**: Effective at removing formaldehyde.

3. **Air Quality Concerns**: If you have specific air quality concerns, such as high levels of formaldehyde or benzene, you may need more plants or specific types of plants.

4. **Lighting**: Consider the lighting conditions in your closet office. Some plants require more light than others. If your closet office is dark, you may need more plants or plants that can thrive in low light conditions.

5. **Maintenance**: Ensure you can maintain the plants properly. Overwatering or neglect can lead to plant death, which can be counterproductive.

### Example Calculation
- If your closet office is 100 square feet (9.3 square meters), you would need about 1 large plant or several small plants.
- If it's 200 square feet (18.6 square meters), you would need 2 large plants or more small plants.

### Practical Tips
- **Multiple Small Plants**: If you have limited space, consider using multiple small plants rather than one large one.
- **Air Purifiers**: While plants are beneficial, they may not be sufficient for all air quality issues. Consider using an air purifier as well.
- **Regular Maintenance**: Keep the plants healthy and clean to ensure they continue to perform their air-purifying functions.

Below is a simple JavaScript program that allows users to draw on an HTML5 canvas. This example includes basic functionalities such as drawing lines, rectangles, and clearing the canvas.

### HTML
First, create an HTML file with a canvas element and some buttons to control the drawing.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
    <meta charset=""UTF-8"">
    <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"">

        }
        button {
            margin: 5px;
        }
    </style>

```

### JavaScript (drawing.js)
Next, create a JavaScript file to handle the drawing logic.

```javascript
let isDrawing = false;
let canvas = document.getElementById('drawingCanvas');
let ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

// Function to start drawing
function startDrawing() {
    isDrawing = true;
    canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', draw);
    canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', start);
}

// Function to stop drawing
function stopDrawing() {
    isDrawing = false;
    canvas.removeEventListener('mousemove', draw);
    canvas.removeEventListener('mousedown', start);
}

// Function to clear the canvas
function clearCanvas() {
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
}

// Function to start drawing on mouse down
function start(event) {
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.moveTo(event.offsetX, event.offsetY);
}

// Function to draw on mouse move
function draw(event) {
    if (!isDrawing) return;
    ctx.lineTo(event.offsetX, event.offsetY);
    ctx.stroke();
}

// Initial setup
canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', start);

1. **Hormonal Imbalance**: Low body fat can disrupt hormonal balance, particularly affecting estrogen levels. This can lead to menstrual irregularities or cessation of menstruation (amenorrhea).

2. **Metabolic Issues**: A very low body fat percentage can affect metabolism, potentially leading to fatigue, decreased energy levels, and difficulty maintaining body temperature.

3. **Bone Health**: Low body fat can contribute to a decrease in bone density, increasing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.

4. **Reproductive Health**: Low body fat can interfere with the normal functioning of the reproductive system, potentially leading to fertility issues.

5. **Mental Health**: Nutritional deficiencies and hormonal imbalances can affect mood and mental health, potentially leading to anxiety, depression, or other psychological issues.

6. **Immune Function**: A low body fat percentage can weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections and illnesses.

7. **Muscle Mass**: While low body fat is generally desirable for aesthetic reasons, very low body fat can lead to muscle wasting, which can affect overall strength and physical performance.

If you or someone you know has a very low body fat percentage, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider to address any underlying issues and ensure overall health and well-being."

However, `v.ParentName` is not a valid property in Lua or Luau.

If you want to access the `Parent` property of an object and then get the `Name` of that parent, you would do it like this:

```lua
local parentName = v.Parent.Name
```

Here's a breakdown of what this does:
- `v.Parent` accesses the `Parent` property of the object `v`.
- `.Name` accesses the `Name` property of the parent object.

Make sure that `v` has a `Parent` property, and that `Parent` has a `Name` property. If `v` does not have a parent, `v.Parent` will be `nil`, and attempting to access `.Name` on `nil` will result in an error.

If you need to handle the case where `v` might not have a parent, you can add a check:

```lua
local parentName = v.Parent and v.Parent.Name or ""No Parent""
```

This will assign `""No Parent""` to `parentName` if `v.Parent` is `nil`."

Here's how you can set it up:

### 1. **Edit the sudoers File**
   The `sudoers` file controls who can run what commands as what users. You should always edit this file with the `visudo` command to avoid syntax errors that could prevent sudo from working at all.

   ```bash
   sudo visudo
   ```

### 2. **Add the User to the `sudo` Group (Optional)**
   If you want to allow a user to run all commands without a password, you can add them to the `sudo` group. This is a more secure approach than adding them to the `wheel` group, which is often used in Debian-based systems.

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>
   ```

   Alternatively, you can add the user to the `wheel` group (common in Red Hat-based systems):

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG wheel <username>
   ```

### 3. **Configure Passwordless Sudo for a Specific User and Command**
   You can configure sudo to allow a specific user to run a specific command without a password. For example, to allow the user `john` to run the `apt-get update` command without a password:

   ```bash
   john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get update
   ```

   This line means that the user `john` can run the `apt-get update` command as any user (indicated by `ALL`) without being prompted for a password.

### 4. **Configure Passwordless Sudo for All Commands**
   If you want to allow a user to run all commands without a password, you can use the `ALL` keyword:

   ```bash
   john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

   This line means that the user `john` can run any command as any user without being prompted for a password.

### 5. **Save and Exit**
   After making the necessary changes, save the file and exit the editor. In `visudo`, you can usually do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, and finally `Enter`.

### 6. **Test the Configuration**
   You can test the configuration"

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy contracted by 20.4% in April, May, and June due to the coronavirus lockdown, performing worse than other major industrial nations, with Scotland experiencing a 19.4% decline."

Here are a few scenarios to consider:

1. **Literal `=`**: If you want to match the `=` symbol literally, you do not need to escape it. For example:
    ```python
    import re

    pattern = r'='
    text = 'a=b'
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    print(match)  # <re.Match object; span=(1, 2), match='='>
    ```

2. **Special Characters**: If `=` is part of a special regex pattern, you might need to escape it. For example, `+*?` are special characters in regex and need to be escaped if you want to match them literally:
    ```python
    import re

    pattern = r'\+='
    text = 'a+=b'
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    print(match)  # <re.Match object; span=(1, 3), match='+='>
    ```

3. **Character Classes**: If `=` is part of a character class, it does not need to be escaped:
    ```python
    import re

    pattern = r'[=]'
    text = 'a=b'
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    print(match)  # <re.Match object; span=(1, 2), match='='>
    ```

4. **Quantifiers**: If `=` is part of a quantifier pattern, it needs to be escaped:
    ```python
    import re

    pattern = r'\+='
    text = 'a+=b'
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    print(match)  # <re.Match object; span=(1, 3), match='+='>
    ```

In summary, the `=` symbol does not need to be escaped when you want to match it literally. However, if it is part of a special regex pattern, you should escape it to match it as a literal character."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that Donald Trump has broken a presidential record by playing golf more than 70 times during his first year in office. This statistic serves as a backdrop for Kimmel's critique of Trump's accomplishments, suggesting that while Trump has spent significant time on leisure activities, he has not achieved much in terms of policy. Kimmel implies that Trump's focus on golf is at odds with the expectations for a president to address important issues, such as healthcare reform, which Kimmel himself has been critical of but sees potential in."

The blanks are always at the end of the question, and can be filled with more than one word or phrase.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

It's a quaint little park nestled in the heart of the city, surrounded by towering skyscrapers and bustling streets. Despite its proximity to the urban chaos, this park is a peaceful oasis, a sanctuary from the noise and stress of everyday life.

As I step into the park, the first thing that strikes me is the lush greenery that surrounds me. The trees are tall and majestic, their branches reaching out to embrace the sky. The leaves rustle gently in the breeze, creating a soothing melody that calms my mind and soothes my soul. The grass is soft and inviting, and I can't resist the urge to sink my toes into it, feeling the cool earth beneath my feet.

But what truly makes this park special is the water feature at its center. A small pond, surrounded by a stone walkway, is home to a variety of fish and frogs. The water is crystal clear, and I can see the fish swimming gracefully beneath the surface. The sound of the water trickling over the rocks is a constant background hum, adding to the peaceful atmosphere of the park.

As I wander through the park, I notice the variety of people who come to enjoy its beauty. Families are picnicking on the grass, couples are walking hand in hand, and children are playing on the playground equipment. Everyone seems to be in a good mood, and the air is filled with laughter and joy.

But what I love most about this park is the sense of community that it fosters. People from all walks of life come together here, sharing a common love for nature and each other. Strangers strike up conversations, and friendships are formed. It's a place where people can come to escape the pressures of the world and find a sense of peace and contentment.

As I leave the park, I feel a sense of gratitude for the beauty and tranquility that it offers. It's a reminder that even in the midst of chaos and uncertainty, there are still places of peace and joy to be found. And for that, I am forever grateful."

   - Create a queue for each company in the Azure Storage Account.
   - For example, create a queue named `SenderQueue` and another named `ReceiverQueue`.

3. **Sender Company Setup**:
   - **Data Preparation**: Prepare the data to be sent in a format that can be easily stored in a queue (e.g., JSON, XML).
   - **Queue Client**: Use Azure SDKs (e.g., Azure Storage SDK for .NET, Python, etc.) to create a queue client.
   - **Send Data**: Send the data to the `ReceiverQueue` using the queue client.
     ```python
     from azure.storage.queue import QueueClient

     queue_client = QueueClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=""your_connection_string"", queue_name=""ReceiverQueue"")
     message = ""Your data here""
     queue_client.send_message(message)
     ```

4. **Receiver Company Setup**:
   - **Queue Client**: Use Azure SDKs to create a queue client for the `SenderQueue`.
   - **Receive Data**: Receive the data from the `SenderQueue` and process it.
     ```python
     from azure.storage.queue import QueueClient

     queue_client = QueueClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=""your_connection_string"", queue_name=""SenderQueue"")
     received_message = queue_client.receive_message()
     print(received_message.content)

Sails are typically made of materials such as canvas, nylon, or polyester, which are visible and tangible. However, the force that propels a sailboat is indeed invisible, as it is generated by the wind, which is a form of air movement. Here are some key points to clarify this:

1. **Sail Material**: Sails are constructed from visible, physical materials like fabric, which can be seen and touched.

2. **Wind**: The wind, which causes the sail to move, is a form of air movement. Air itself is invisible.

3. **Force of Wind**: The force exerted by the wind on the sail is invisible. This force is what propels the sailboat.

4. **Sail Shape and Design**: The shape and design of the sail are crucial in capturing and directing the wind's force. However, the sail itself is not made of air.

In summary, sails are physical objects made of visible materials, but the wind and the force it exerts on the sail are invisible."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.""  Answer:

We can use publicly available datasets like IMDB movie reviews, Yelp reviews, Twitter sentiment analysis, and Amazon product reviews. We can also collect our own data by scraping online reviews or conducting surveys.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by removing stop words, punctuations, and special characters. We can also perform stemming and lemmatization to reduce words to their root form. We can also perform entity recognition to identify named entities like people, organizations, and locations.

3. Feature Extraction: Extract features from the text using techniques like bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings. We can also use advanced techniques like named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing to extract semantic features.

4. Model Selection: Select a suitable machine learning algorithm for sentiment analysis. We can use supervised learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests. We can also use deep learning algorithms like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

5. Model Training: Train the model on the preprocessed and feature-extracted data. We can use cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data. We can also use techniques like grid search and random search to tune the hyperparameters of the model.

6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We can also use confusion matrices to visualize the model's performance.

7. Model Deployment: Deploy the model in a production environment where it can be used to analyze new text data. We can use APIs to integrate the model with other applications.

8. Model Maintenance: Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain it periodically with new data to ensure that it remains accurate and up-to-date.

By following these steps, we can develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately differentiate positive and negative emotions expressed in textual content. The model can be used in various applications like customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and market research."

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string into a short, shareable string in JavaScript, you can use a combination of base64 encoding and URL-safe encoding. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Base64 Encoding**: Convert the string to a base64 encoded string.
2. **URL-Safe Encoding**: Replace any characters that are not URL-safe (e.g., `/` and `+`) with characters that are URL-safe (e.g., `-` and `_`).

Here's a complete example:

```javascript
function encodeString(input) {
    // Step 1: Base64 encode the input string
    const base64Encoded = btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(input)));
    
    // Step 2: URL-safe encode the base64 string
    const urlSafeEncoded = base64Encoded.replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_').replace(/=/g, '');
    
    return urlSafeEncoded;
}

function decodeString(encoded) {
    // Step 1: URL-safe decode the encoded string
    const urlSafeDecoded = encoded.replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/');
    
    // Step 2: Base64 decode the URL-safe string
    const base64Decoded = atob(escape(decodeURIComponent(urlSafeDecoded)));
    
    return base64Decoded;
}

// Example usage
const originalString = ""This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";
const encodedString = encodeString(originalString);
console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);

const decodedString = decodeString(encodedString);
console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base64 Encoding**:
   - `encodeURIComponent(input)` encodes the string to handle special characters.
   - `unescape()` is used to decode the encoded string back to its original form.
   - `btoa()` converts the string to a base64 encoded string.

2. **URL-Safe Encoding**:
   - Replace `+` with `-` and `/` with `_` to make the string URL-safe.
   - Remove any trailing `=` characters, which are padding characters in base64 encoding.

3. **Base64 Decoding**:
   - Replace `-` with `+` and `_` with `/` to revert the URL-safe encoding.
   - `escape"

Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node using a heuristic search algorithm, we can use the A* search algorithm. A* search uses a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal, which in this case is the Manhattan distance (also known as taxicab or city block distance).

The heuristic function \( h(n) \) for a node \( n \) is the Manhattan distance from \( n \) to the goal node. The cost function \( f(n) \) is the sum of the cost from the start node to \( n \) (g(n)) and the heuristic estimate from \( n \) to the goal (h(n)):

\[ f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \]

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz and achieve the ideal foam and bloom, follow these steps and tips:

### Ingredients:
- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz egg white
- 1 oz lemon juice
- 1 oz lime juice
- 1 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz orange flower water
- 1 oz cream
- Soda water (Topo Chico is recommended)
- Ice cubes (small, about 3-4)

### Equipment:
- Cocktail shaker
- Strainer
- Collins glass

### Instructions:

1. **Dry Shake:**
   - Add the gin, egg white, lemon juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your cocktail shaker.
   - Shake vigorously without adding ice for about 2 minutes. This helps to emulsify the egg white and incorporate air into the mixture, which is crucial for creating the foam.

2. **Add Ice and Shake Again:**
   - Add a small amount of ice (about 3-4 small cubes) to the shaker.
   - Shake again until the mixture is well-chilled or until the ice has mostly melted. This ensures the drink is cold and the ingredients are fully combined.

3. **Strain and Serve:**
   - Pour the soda water into a Collins glass first.
   - Strain the cocktail over the soda water.
   - The meringue should separate from the liquid, and the foam should rise to the top. If it doesn't, don't worry; the drink will still taste great.

### Tips for Achieving the Ideal Foam and Bloom:

1. **Shake Vigorously:**
   - The key to a good Ramos Gin Fizz is the vigorous shaking. The longer you shake, the more air you incorporate, which helps create the foam. Some bartenders recommend shaking for 5 to 35 minutes, but 2 minutes is a good starting point.

2. **Use Small Ice Cubes:**
   - Using smaller ice cubes can help create smaller bubbles, which can contribute to a finer foam. This is especially important for achieving the ideal bloom.

3. **Emulsify the Egg White:**
   - The egg white is a crucial component for creating the foam. Make sure to shake it vigorously to emulsify it properly. This will help create a stable foam that rises to the top of the drink.

4. **Use the Right"

We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross.

A group has the following properties: uid, name, thumbnail\_url, creation\_date
This API must be written in Python, using FastAPI and pydantic for DTO.
DTO names must end with ""DTO"".
I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","Certainly! Below is an example of a REST API using FastAPI and Pydantic to manage groups of users. The API will include separate DTOs for read and write operations.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages
First, make sure you have FastAPI and Uvicorn installed. You can install them using pip:

```sh
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

### Step 2: Define DTOs

We will define two DTOs: one for creating or updating groups (`GroupWriteDTO`) and another for reading groups (`GroupReadDTO`).

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class GroupWriteDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: str

class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: int
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: str
```

### Step 3: Define the Group Model

We will define a simple in-memory model to store the groups. In a real-world application, you would likely use a database.

```python
groups = []
```

### Step 4: Define the API Endpoints

Now, we will define the API endpoints using FastAPI.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends
from typing import List, Optional
from datetime import datetime

app = FastAPI()

# In-memory storage for groups
groups = []

# Dependency to get the current date
def get_current_date() -> str:
    return datetime.now().strftime(""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"")

# Endpoint to create a new group
@app.post(""/groups/"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
def create_group(group: GroupWriteDTO, current_date: str = Depends(get_current_date)):
    new_group = group.dict()
    new_group[""uid""] = len(groups) + 1
    new_group[""creation_date""] = current_date
    groups.append(new_group)
    return new_group

# Endpoint to get a group by UID
@app.get(""/groups/{group_id}"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
def read_group(group_id: int):
    group = next((g for g in groups if g[""uid""] == group_id), None)

These differences can be influenced by various factors, including climate, availability of hosts, and local ecosystems. Here are some general observations:

1. **Climate and Seasonality**: In regions with distinct seasons, Tabanus species may have different flight patterns. For example, in temperate regions, they might be more active during the warmer months, while in tropical regions, they could be active year-round.

2. **Host Availability**: The abundance and distribution of hosts (such as horses, cattle, and other animals) can influence flight patterns. In areas with a high density of hosts, Tabanus may be more concentrated in those areas, leading to more frequent flights in those regions.

3. **Elevation**: In mountainous regions, flight patterns can vary with elevation. Higher elevations might have cooler temperatures, which could affect the activity levels of Tabanus.

4. **Vegetation and Habitat**: The type of vegetation and habitat can also impact flight patterns. For instance, Tabanus might be more active in open fields or near water bodies where hosts are more likely to congregate.

5. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Some Tabanus species have evolved specific behaviors to cope with different environmental conditions. For example, some species might be more active during the day in some regions and more active at night in others.

While these general trends exist, it's important to note that specific flight patterns and behaviors can vary significantly between different species of Tabanus and even between populations within the same species. For detailed information, it would be best to consult local entomological studies or research specific to the region of interest."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
