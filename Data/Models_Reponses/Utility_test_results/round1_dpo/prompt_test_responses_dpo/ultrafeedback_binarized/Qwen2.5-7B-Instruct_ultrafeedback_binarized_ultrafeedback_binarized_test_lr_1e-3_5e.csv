Here are some key approaches:

1. **Energy Efficiency**: Incorporate energy-efficient design principles such as passive solar design, which maximizes natural light and heat gain in winter and minimizes it in summer. Use high-performance windows, insulation, and efficient HVAC systems to reduce energy consumption.

2. **Renewable Energy Sources**: Integrate renewable energy technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, or geothermal systems to generate electricity and heat. This can significantly reduce reliance on non-renewable energy sources.

3. **Water Conservation**: Implement water-saving measures such as low-flow fixtures, rainwater harvesting systems, and greywater recycling systems. Design landscapes that require minimal irrigation and use native plants that are adapted to the local climate.

4. **Sustainable Materials**: Use sustainable building materials that have a low environmental impact, such as recycled, reclaimed, or locally sourced materials. Consider the entire lifecycle of materials, from extraction to disposal.

5. **Green Roofs and Walls**: Install green roofs and living walls to improve insulation, reduce urban heat island effects, and enhance biodiversity. These features can also help manage stormwater runoff.

6. **Smart Home Technology**: Incorporate smart home technology to optimize energy use, monitor and control heating, cooling, and lighting systems, and manage water usage.

7. **Compact Design**: Plan developments with a compact design to reduce the need for long commutes and promote walkability and cycling. This can also help preserve natural habitats and reduce the urban heat island effect.

8. **Community Spaces**: Create community spaces that encourage social interaction and reduce the need for car travel. These spaces can include parks, community gardens, and shared amenities.

9. **Waste Management**: Implement waste reduction strategies such as composting, recycling programs, and the use of durable, reusable materials. Design buildings and landscapes to minimize waste generation.

10. **Transportation Options**: Provide a range of transportation options, including public transit, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly paths. Encourage the use of electric vehicles and car-sharing programs.

11. **Biodiversity and Habitat Preservation**: Design developments that preserve and enhance local ecosystems. This can include creating green corridors, protecting existing vegetation, and incorporating native plant species.

12. **Certification Programs**: Aim for certification from recognized sustainability programs such as LEED ("

When you encounter a 404 error while running `docker-compose up`, it's usually not directly related to the HTTP 404 error you might see in a web browser. Instead, it could be due to several issues related to your Docker Compose setup. Here are some common reasons and troubleshooting steps:

1. **Incorrect Service Name**:
   - Ensure that the service name you are trying to start with `docker-compose up` is correct and matches the service names defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

2. **Service Not Defined**:
   - Verify that the service you are trying to start actually exists in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. **Network Issues**:
   - Ensure that the service is running and accessible. You can use `docker ps` to check if the containers are running.

4. **Port Mappings**:
   - If you are trying to access a service via a port, ensure that the port mapping is correctly defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file and that the service is listening on the correct port.

5. **Service Dependencies**:
   - If your service depends on other services, ensure that those services are running before you start the dependent service.

6. **Logs**:
   - Check the logs of the service to see if there are any errors or issues. You can use `docker-compose logs <service_name>` to view the logs.

7. **File Path**:
   - Ensure that the `docker-compose.yml` file is in the correct directory and that the path is specified correctly if you are using a different file.

8. **Service Configuration**:
   - Check the configuration of the service in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Ensure that the service is configured correctly and that there are no typos or syntax errors.

Here is an example of a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - ""80:80""
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
```

To start the services, you would run:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

The author's emotional state appears to be one of isolation, frustration, and possibly anger. The use of the metaphor of an ""inaccessible fort"" suggests a sense of being trapped or disconnected from others or society. This could indicate feelings of alienation or a desire for connection that is unfulfilled. The overall tone of the passage hints at a critical and reflective mood, possibly stemming from a sense of disillusionment or dissatisfaction with the current political or social situation."

NASA's Clean Air Study, which is often referenced, suggests that one large plant or three to five smaller plants can improve air quality in a 100 square foot room. However, a closet office is likely smaller than this, so you would need fewer plants.

Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Size of the Closet**: Measure the closet to determine its square footage. A small closet might be around 50-100 square feet, while a larger one could be 150-200 square feet.

2. **Types of Plants**: Some plants are more effective at removing certain pollutants. For example, snake plants (Sansevieria) and spider plants (Chlorophytum comosum) are known for their air-purifying abilities. Larger plants like fiddle leaf figs (Ficus lyrata) or peace lilies (Spathiphyllum) can also be effective.

3. **Number of Plants**: For a small closet (50-100 square feet), you might need 1-2 large plants or 3-5 smaller plants. For a larger closet (150-200 square feet), you might need 2-3 large plants or 5-7 smaller plants.

4. **Air Quality Concerns**: If you have specific air quality concerns (e.g., high levels of formaldehyde, benzene, or other pollutants), you may need more plants or specific types of plants known to address those pollutants.

Here’s a simple example:
- A small closet (75 square feet) might benefit from 2-3 smaller plants like spider plants or 1-2 larger plants like snake plants.

Remember, while plants can help improve air quality, they are not a substitute for proper ventilation. Ensure your closet has adequate airflow to maximize the benefits of the plants."

Body fat percentage is important for overall health, as it affects hormone levels, metabolism, and energy levels. Here are some potential consequences of having a very low body fat percentage:

1. **Hormonal Imbalance**: Low body fat can lead to hormonal imbalances, particularly affecting estrogen levels. This can result in menstrual irregularities or amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), which can have long-term reproductive health implications.

2. **Metabolic Issues**: A very low body fat percentage can affect metabolism, potentially leading to fatigue, weakness, and difficulty maintaining body temperature.

3. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Low body fat can be associated with inadequate nutrient intake, which can lead to deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals.

4. **Bone Health**: Low body fat can contribute to lower bone density, increasing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.

5. **Mental Health**: Significant weight loss and low body fat can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and body image issues.

6. **Physical Performance**: For athletes, very low body fat can impair physical performance and endurance.

If a woman's body fat percentage is consistently below 16%, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the underlying causes and to develop a plan to address any potential health concerns. This may include dietary adjustments, increased caloric intake, and possibly medical intervention to address any hormonal or metabolic issues."

20. What's is the sum of the squares of all factors of 210?","To find the sum of the squares of all factors of 210, we first need to determine its prime factorization and then use properties of divisors and their squares.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 210
\[ 210 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \]

### Step 2: List All Factors
The factors of 210 can be found by considering all combinations of its prime factors:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, 210 \]

### Step 3: Sum of Squares of Factors
To find the sum of the squares of all factors, we use the property that if \( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} \), then the sum of the squares of the divisors of \( n \) is given by:
\[ \sigma_2(n) = (1 + p_1^2 + p_1^4 + \cdots + p_1^{2e_1})(1 + p_2^2 + p_2^4 + \cdots + p_2^{2e_2}) \cdots (1 + p_k^2 + p_k^4 + \cdots + p_k^{2e_k}) \]

For \( n = 210 = 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 \), we have:
\[ \sigma_2(210) = (1 + 2^2)(1 + 3^2)(1 + 5^2)(1 + 7^2) \]

### Step 4: Calculate Each Term
\[ 1 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 \]
\[ 1 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10 \]
\[ 1 + 5^2 = 1 + 25 = 26 \]
\[ 1 + 7^2 = 1 + 49 = 50 \]"

However, in Roblox, which uses Lua (often referred to as ""Luau"" for the next generation of Roblox Lua), the syntax is slightly different.

In Roblox's Luau, you can use `v.Parent.Name` to access the `Name` property of the `Parent` of a variable `v`. Here's an example:

```lua
local v = script.Parent -- Assuming script is a part of a Roblox model
print(v.Parent.Name) -- This will print the name of the parent of v
```

So, yes, you can use `v.Parent.Name` in Luau (Roblox's Lua dialect) to access the `Name` property of the `Parent` of `v`."

","Let's analyze the given statement and the conclusion:

Given statement: ""A man with a mustache and blue garment sitting on a sidewalk and playing a stringed instrument.""
Conclusion: ""A man with a creepy mustache is outside playing guitar.""

1. The mustache is described as ""creepy"" in the conclusion, but the original statement only mentions that the man has a mustache. There's no information to suggest the mustache is creepy.
2. The original statement mentions a ""blue garment,"" but the conclusion specifies a ""blue"" (without article) garment, which could be interpreted as a contradiction.
3. The original statement says the man is playing a ""stringed instrument,"" but the conclusion specifies a ""guitar."" While a guitar is a stringed instrument, not all stringed instruments are guitars.

However, it's important to use this feature with caution, as it can potentially expose your system to security risks if not managed properly.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up passwordless sudo for a specific user or command:

### 1. Open the sudoers file
The sudoers file is the configuration file for sudo. You need to edit this file with the `visudo` command to ensure that the changes are made safely.

```bash
sudo visudo
```

### 2. Add the passwordless sudo rule
You can add a rule to allow a specific user to run all commands without a password, or you can specify a particular command.

#### For a specific user to run all commands without a password:
Add the following line to the sudoers file, replacing `username` with the actual username:

```bash
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

#### For a specific user to run a specific command without a password:
Add the following line to the sudoers file, replacing `username` and `command` with the actual username and command:

```bash
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/command
```

### 3. Save and exit
After adding the rule, save the file and exit the editor. In `visudo`, you can usually do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` to confirm, and `Enter` to save.

### 4. Test the configuration
You can test the configuration by logging in as the specified user and running a command with sudo. If the configuration is correct, the command should run without prompting for a password.

```bash
sudo /path/to/command
```

### Important Considerations
- **Security**: Be cautious when granting passwordless sudo access. It's generally better to limit the commands that can be run without a password.
- **Logging**: Ensure that you have proper logging in place to monitor sudo activities.
- **Auditing**: Regularly review the sudo logs to ensure that the passwordless sudo access is being used as intended.

By following these steps, you can set up passwordless sudo in Linux for specific users or commands, making it easier to automate tasks while maintaining some level of security."

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy contracted by 20.4% in April, May, and June due to the coronavirus lockdown, performing worse than other major industrial nations, with Scotland experiencing a slighter smaller decline of 19.4%."
af2d3f64a2f1c1dc8193ed1a7f51bf522de6369ed031cec03d35dc2e6c6ae4fd,In python variety of regex do I need to escape a literal = symbol?,"In Python's `re` module, you do not need to escape the `=` symbol with a backslash (`\`) when using it as a literal character in a regular expression. The `=` symbol is not a special character in regex, so it can be used directly without escaping.

Here's an example:

```python
import re

pattern = r'='
text = 'a=b'

match = re.search(pattern, text)
if match:
    print(""Match found!"")
else:
    print(""No match found."")
```

In this example, the `=` symbol is used as a literal character in the regex pattern, and it does not need to be escaped.

However, if you were to use `=` as part of a special regex pattern (like in a look-ahead or look-behind assertion), it would not be necessary to escape it, but it would be treated as a literal `=`.

If you ever find that you need to escape a character in a regex pattern, you can do so by preceding it with a backslash (`\`). For example, if you wanted to match the `=` symbol itself, you could write:

```python
pattern = r'\='
```

But in the case of `=`, it is not necessary to escape it."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel highlighted that Donald Trump has broken the record for playing golf more than any other president during his first year in office, 70 times to be exact. This statistic serves as a backdrop for Kimmel's critique of Trump's accomplishments, suggesting that while many people claim the president hasn't achieved much, Trump has spent a significant amount of time on a leisure activity rather than focusing on governance. Kimmel uses this as a segue to discuss healthcare, emphasizing that despite his criticism of Trump's efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, there are positive aspects of the current healthcare plan that people should consider, such as coverage for pre-existing conditions and affordability for those earning under $50,000."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

It's a small, picturesque village called Willowbrook, where the world seems to slow down and the air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers.

As you approach Willowbrook, the first thing that catches your eye is the winding, cobblestone path that leads to the village square. The path is lined with vibrant wildflowers and lush green trees that provide a canopy of shade. The air is filled with the gentle rustling of leaves and the distant sound of birdsong, creating a peaceful and serene atmosphere.

The village square is the heart of Willowbrook, where locals gather to socialize, shop, and enjoy the simple pleasures of life. The square is surrounded by charming, quaint shops and cafes, each with its own unique character and charm. The aroma of freshly baked bread and pastries wafts through the air, making your mouth water with anticipation.

But what truly makes Willowbrook special is the people who call it home. The villagers are warm and welcoming, always ready to strike up a conversation or offer a helping hand. They take pride in their community and work together to maintain its beauty and charm. The village is a tight-knit family, and everyone looks out for one another.

As the sun sets, the village comes alive with the sound of music and laughter. The villagers gather around the square to enjoy a night of live music, dancing, and storytelling. The stars twinkle above, casting a warm glow over the village, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers.

Willowbrook is a place that makes me happy because it reminds me of the simple joys in life. It's a place where time seems to stand still, and the world is a little bit more beautiful. It's a place where I can escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life and reconnect with the things that truly matter."

Sails are typically made of materials such as canvas, nylon, or polyester, which are visible. However, the force that propels a sailboat is generated by the wind, which is invisible. Here are the key reasons why a sailboat moves:

1. **Wind**: The wind is the primary force that moves the sail. Wind is a flow of air, which is invisible.

2. **Sail Design**: The sail captures the wind and converts its kinetic energy into mechanical energy, which moves the boat.

3. **Aerodynamics**: The shape and design of the sail allow it to interact with the wind in a way that generates lift, similar to how an airplane wing works.

4. **Keel and Rudder**: These components help stabilize the boat and control its direction, ensuring that the sail can effectively harness the wind's energy.

In summary, while the sail itself is visible, the wind that powers the sail is invisible, and the sail's ability to harness this wind is due to its design and the principles of aerodynamics."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

However, many experts and organizations consider climate change to be the most critical issue threatening all life on Earth. Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Rising Global Temperatures**: The Earth's average temperature has been increasing due to the greenhouse effect, primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. This warming leads to more extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and loss of biodiversity.

2. **Ocean Acidification**: Increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere leads to more CO2 being absorbed by the oceans, causing them to become more acidic. This can harm marine life, particularly organisms with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons, such as corals and mollusks.

3. **Loss of Biodiversity**: Climate change, along with habitat destruction, pollution, and overexploitation, is leading to a significant loss of biodiversity. This can have cascading effects on ecosystems, potentially leading to the collapse of food chains and the loss of essential ecosystem services.

4. **Food and Water Security**: Changes in climate patterns can affect agricultural productivity, leading to food shortages and price increases. Additionally, changes in precipitation patterns can lead to water scarcity in some regions.

5. **Health Impacts**: Climate change can exacerbate health issues, including heat-related illnesses, the spread of vector-borne diseases (such as malaria and dengue fever), and mental health problems related to environmental disasters.

While climate change is a major threat, other issues like pollution, deforestation, overfishing, and nuclear proliferation also pose significant risks to the planet's ecosystems and all life on Earth. Addressing these issues requires global cooperation and sustained efforts to reduce environmental impacts and promote sustainable practices."

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string into a short, shareable string in JavaScript, you can use a combination of base64 encoding and URL-safe encoding. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. **Base64 Encoding**: Convert the string to a base64 encoded string.
2. **URL-Safe Encoding**: Replace any characters that are not URL-safe (e.g., `/` and `+`) with characters that are safe for URLs (e.g., `-` and `_`).

Here's a complete example:

```javascript
function encodeString(longString) {
    // Step 1: Base64 encode the string
    const base64Encoded = btoa(longString);

    // Step 2: URL-safe encode the base64 string
    const urlSafeEncoded = base64Encoded.replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_').replace(/=/g, '');

    return urlSafeEncoded;
}

function decodeString(shortString) {
    // Step 1: URL-safe decode the string
    const urlSafeDecoded = shortString.replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/');

    // Step 2: Base64 decode the string
    const base64Decoded = atob(urlSafeDecoded);

    return base64Decoded;
}

// Example usage
const longString = ""This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";
const shortString = encodeString(longString);
console.log(""Encoded:"", shortString);

const decodedString = decodeString(shortString);
console.log(""Decoded:"", decodedString);
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base64 Encoding**:
   - `btoa(longString)` converts the string to a base64 encoded string.
   - The `=` characters at the end of the base64 string are removed because they are not necessary for URL encoding.

2. **URL-Safe Encoding**:
   - Replace `+` with `-` and `/` with `_` to make the string URL-safe.
   - The `=` characters are also removed as they are not needed for URL-safe encoding.

3. **Decoding**:
   - Reverse the steps: first, replace `-` with `+` and `_` with `/` to revert to the base64 format.
   - Then, use `atob(urlSafeDecoded)` to decode the"

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node using heuristic search, we can use the A* search algorithm. A* search uses a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal, which in this case is the Manhattan distance (also known as taxicab or city block distance).

The heuristic function \( h(n) \) for a node \( n \) is the Manhattan distance from \( n \) to the goal node. The cost function \( f(n) \) is the sum of the cost from the start node to \( n \) (g(n)) and the heuristic estimate from \( n \) to the goal (h(n)):

\[ f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \]

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz and achieve the ideal foam and bloom, follow these steps and tips:

1. **Ingredients and Equipment**:
   - Gin (preferably a neutral or light-bodied gin)
   - Egg white (for texture and stability)
   - Lemon and lime juice
   - Simple syrup
   - Orange flower water (optional, but recommended for a delicate floral note)
   - Heavy cream (for richness)
   - Ice cubes (small for better chilling and foam)
   - Soda water (preferably carbonated)
   - Shaker (preferably a double-jigger shaker for better mixing)
   - Collins glass

2. **Shaking Technique**:
   - **Dry Shake**: Start by shaking the egg white, lemon juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water without ice for about 20-30 seconds. This helps emulsify the egg white and mix the other ingredients thoroughly.
   - **Wet Shake**: Add ice to the shaker and shake vigorously for another 20-30 seconds. This chills the mixture and further incorporates the ingredients.
   - **Total Shake Time**: Aim for a total of about 1-2 minutes of shaking. This ensures a good emulsion and helps create the desired foam.

3. **Cream Addition**:
   - After shaking with ice, add a small amount of heavy cream (about 1-2 tablespoons) and a few small ice cubes. Shake again for about 10-20 seconds to incorporate the cream and chill the mixture further.

4. **Straining and Serving**:
   - Pour the mixture into a Collins glass filled with soda water. The carbonation from the soda water will help lift the foam.
   - Strain the cocktail over the soda water to ensure a clean, smooth drink.

5. **Achieving the Ideal Foam and Bloom**:
   - **Shake Vigorously**: The key to achieving the ideal foam and bloom is to shake the mixture vigorously for the recommended time. This helps create a stable emulsion that will rise to the top as foam.
   - **Use Small Ice Cubes**: Smaller ice cubes will melt more quickly, which can help in achieving a better foam. The ice should be just enough to chill the mixture without diluting it too much.
   - **Proper Ratios**: Ensure the correct ratio of ingredients. Too much cream or not enough egg white"

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.

These differences can be influenced by various factors, including climate, availability of hosts, and local ecosystems. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Climate and Seasonality**: In regions with distinct seasons, Tabanus species may have different flight patterns. For example, they might be more active during warmer months when hosts are more readily available. In colder regions, their activity may be limited to warmer periods of the day or warmer seasons.

2. **Host Availability**: The abundance and distribution of hosts (such as horses, cattle, and other animals) can influence flight patterns. In areas with a high density of hosts, Tabanus may be more concentrated in those areas, leading to more frequent flights in those regions.

3. **Elevation and Topography**: In mountainous regions, flight patterns can vary based on elevation. Tabanus species may be more common in lower elevations where temperatures are warmer and hosts are more abundant.

4. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Some Tabanus species have developed specific behaviors to cope with their environment. For example, some species may be more active during the day in regions with strong UV light, which can help them locate hosts more effectively.

5. **Genetic Differences**: Over time, different populations of Tabanus in various regions may develop genetic differences that affect their flight patterns and behavior. These differences can be influenced by local selection pressures, such as the presence of specific host species or environmental conditions.

While these factors can contribute to regional differences in flight patterns, it's important to note that Tabanus species are generally highly mobile and can travel significant distances, which can complicate the identification of specific regional behaviors. For detailed information, it would be best to consult local entomological studies or research specific to the region of interest."

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
