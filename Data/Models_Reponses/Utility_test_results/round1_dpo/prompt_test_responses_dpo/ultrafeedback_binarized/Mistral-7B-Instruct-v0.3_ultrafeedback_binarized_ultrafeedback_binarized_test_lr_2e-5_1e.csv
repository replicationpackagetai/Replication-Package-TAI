1. Energy Efficiency: Buildings can be designed to be more energy efficient by using insulation, energy-efficient windows, and energy-efficient appliances. Solar panels can also be installed on the roofs of buildings to generate renewable energy.
2. Water Conservation: Rainwater harvesting systems can be installed to collect rainwater for use in irrigation and flushing toilets. Low-flow showerheads and dual-flush toilets can also be installed to reduce water usage.
3. Green Spaces: Green spaces such as parks, gardens, and trees can be incorporated into the development to provide habitats for wildlife, reduce heat island effect, and improve air quality.
4. Materials: Sustainable materials such as recycled materials, locally sourced materials, and materials with low embodied energy can be used in construction.
5. Transport: The development can be designed to be accessible by public transportation, walking, and cycling to reduce carbon emissions from private vehicles.
6. Waste Management: Waste management systems can be put in place to reduce, reuse, and recycle waste. Composting systems can also be installed to convert organic waste into compost.
7. Social Sustainability: The development can be designed to be inclusive and accessible to all residents, regardless of age, disability, or income level. Affordable housing units can also be included in the development to ensure that it is not just for the wealthy.
8. Education and Engagement: Residents can be educated on sustainable practices such as water conservation, energy efficiency, and waste reduction. They can also be engaged in the planning and management of the development to ensure that it is sustainable in the long term.
9. Adaptability: The development can be designed to be adaptable to future changes in technology, climate, and demographics. This can include using modular construction, designing buildings to be easily retrofitted, and incorporating green infrastructure.
10. Monitoring and Evaluation: The development can be monitored and evaluated to ensure that it is meeting its sustainability goals. This can include using sensors to monitor energy and water usage, conducting surveys to assess resident satisfaction, and using life cycle assessment to evaluate the environmental impact of the development."

The 404 error is usually related to a permissions issue. Here are a few things you can check:

1. Make sure you are running the command as a user with sufficient permissions. You can try running the command with `sudo` to see if that helps.

2. Check the ownership and permissions of your `docker-compose.yml` file and the directory it's located in. You can use the `ls -l` command to check the permissions and `ls -l /path/to/your/docker-compose.yml` to check the ownership.

3. Make sure the user running the command has the necessary permissions to access the `docker-compose.yml` file and the directories it's located in.

4. If you're using a non-root user, you might need to add the current directory to the `$DOCKER_HOST` environment variable. You can do this by running:

```
export DOCKER_HOST=/path/to/your/directory
```

before running `docker-compose up`.

5. If none of the above helps, you might want to check the Docker logs for more information:

```
docker logs docker
```

This should give you more information about what's going wrong.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have more questions."

The use of the word ""ruined"" implies that the author feels their situation is beyond repair, and the use of ""inaccessible"" suggests a feeling of being cut off from help or support.

These air purifiers are equipped with HEPA filters that can capture 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns.

To determine the number of air purifiers you need, you should consider the size of your closet office and the level of air pollution you are dealing with. As a general guideline, a small air purifier with a HEPA filter can effectively clean the air in a room up to 150 square feet. If your closet office is smaller than that, one air purifier should be sufficient. However, if you are dealing with high levels of air pollution, you may need multiple air purifiers to effectively clean the air.

It's also important to note that air purifiers are not a substitute for proper ventilation. You should still make sure to keep windows open and doors closed when possible to allow fresh air to circulate and reduce the level of air pollution in your closet office.

Additionally, you may want to consider adding plants to your closet office as well. Certain plants, such as spider plants and snake plants, are known for their air-purifying abilities and can help improve the air quality in your space. However, relying solely on plants to clean the air in your closet office may not be sufficient, and an air purifier should still be used."

This example assumes that you have a form with an input of type `file`:

```html
<form action=""upload.php"" method=""post"" enctype=""multipart/form-data"">
    <input type=""file"" name=""image"">
    <input type=""submit"" value=""Upload Image"">
</form>
```

In the `upload.php` file, you can use the following code to handle the uploaded file:

```php
<?php

if (isset($_FILES['image']) {
    $upload_dir = 'uploads/';
    if (!file_exists($upload_dir)) {
        mkdir($upload_dir, 0777, true);
    }

    $upload_file = $_FILES['image']['tmp_name'];
    $new_file = $upload_dir . basename($_FILES['image']['name']);

    if (move_uploaded_file($upload_file, $new_file)) {
        echo ""Image uploaded successfully."";
    } else {
        echo ""There was an error uploading the image."";
    }
}

?>
```

This code creates a directory named `uploads/` if it doesn't exist, moves the uploaded file to the `uploads/` directory, and then displays a success message if the upload was successful. If there was an error during the upload process, it displays an error message.

You may want to add additional validation and error handling to this code, such as checking the file type and size, and ensuring that the user is authorized to upload images. You may also want to consider using a library like PHP's FileInfo extension or imagick for handling the uploaded images."

```

Now, you can use a JavaScript library like Google Charts or Highcharts to visualize the data. You can send the data to a JavaScript file using AJAX or JSONP, and then use the JavaScript library to create the bar graph.

Here's an example using Google Charts:

```javascript
google.charts.load('packages/corechart/src/corechart_loaded.js', {'packages':['bar'], callback: function () {

var data = new google.visualization.DataTable();

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

If a woman's body fat percentage falls below 16%, it could potentially lead to health issues. This is because the body needs a certain amount of fat for essential functions, such as hormone production and maintaining reproductive health. If a woman's body fat percentage drops too low, it could affect her menstrual cycle, fertility, and overall health. It's important for women to maintain a healthy and balanced diet, and engage in regular physical activity to ensure they are maintaining a healthy body fat percentage. It's also important to consult with a healthcare provider to discuss individual needs and goals."

20. What's is the sum of the squares of all factors of 210?","To solve this problem, we first need to find the factors of 210. The prime factorization of 210 is 2 * 5 * 7.

The sum of the squares of these prime factors is:

2^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 = 4 + 25 + 49 = 78

Since 210 is the product of these three primes, the sum of the squares of all factors of 210 will be the sum of the squares of all numbers obtained by multiplying these primes in different ways, plus the sum of the squares of numbers obtained by raising 2, 5, and 7 to a power greater than 1.

However, since 210 is already the product of three distinct primes, there are no other factors of 210 other than those we have found. Therefore, the sum of the squares of all factors of 210 is simply 78.

So, the sum of the squares of all factors of 210 is 78."

To use passwordless sudo in Linux, you can configure sudo to use a keyfile instead of a password. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up passwordless sudo:

1. First, you need to create a keyfile for the user who will be using sudo. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```
sudo touch /etc/sudoers.d/username
```

Replace `username` with the username of the user who will be using sudo.

2. Change the ownership of the keyfile to the user:

```
sudo chown username:username /etc/sudoers.d/username
```

3. Now, create a new file for the keyfile content:

```
nano /etc/sudoers.d/username
```

4. In the new file, add the following lines:

```
# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.

Defaults        true

# Uncomment to allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo   ALL=(ALL) ALL

# Uncomment to explicitly allow sudo to run visudo and other specified files
%sudo   ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/visudo, /etc/sudoers
%sudo   ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/passwd, /usr/bin/chfn, /usr/bin/newgrp
```

5. Save and close the file.

6. Now, create a new file for the user's password:

```
sudo touch /etc/sudoers.d/username_pw
```

7. Change the ownership of the password file to the user:

```
sudo chown username:username /etc/sudoers.d/username_pw
```

8. Open the password file in a text editor:

```
nano /etc/sudoers.d/username_pw
```

9. In the new file, add the user's password in the following format:"

Lastly, submission with ['id', 'label]. Label consists 0 to 7, and the text column consists of news article data. Write some codes about augmentation, then, classifies via keras with other models ensembled. Validation must be f1 macro.","To perform data augmentation, we can use the `textaugment` library. Here's a simple example of how to use it:

```python
from textaugment import TextDataGenerator

# Load your data
train_data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test_data = pd.read_csv('test.csv')

    seed=42
)

# Fit the data
X_train = datagen.fit_transform(train_data['text'].values)

Now, let's move on to the model building part. We'll use a simple LSTM model as a starting point, and then ensemble it with other models.

```python
from keras.models import Sequential

# Define the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(input_dim=vocabary_size, output_dim=256, input_length=max_len))

model.add(Dense(64, activation='softmax'))

# Fit the model
model.fit(X_train, train_labels, validation_data=(X_val, val_labels), epochs=10, batch_size=64)

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over April, May and June due to the coronavirus lockdown, with Scotland experiencing a slightly smaller decline. The UK is projected to have the worst performance among major industrial nations for 2020."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel stated that Donald Trump has played golf more times than any other president in a year, which he considers an accomplishment, despite criticism that Trump has not achieved anything in his presidency. Kimmel suggests that those who criticize Trump's accomplishments should instead focus on something positive, such as signing up for the Affordable Care Act during the current enrollment period. Kimmel also criticizes Trump's administration for trying to undermine the plan, but notes that enrollment has surged despite these efforts. Kimmel then discusses the new health care plan, stating that it covers pre-existing conditions, has no lifetime caps, allows you to keep your kids on it, and is surprisingly affordable for people making under $50,000. Kimmel encourages viewers to visit Healthcare.gov and sign up for the plan, even if they do not support President Trump."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

1. Create two Azure Storage Accounts:
   - CompanyAStorageAccount
   - CompanyBStorageAccount

2. Create two Azure Service Bus Namespaces:
   - CompanyAQueueNamespace
   - CompanyBQueueNamespace

3. Create two Azure Storage Queues in each namespace:
   - CompanyAQueue
   - CompanyBQueue

4. Create two Azure Functions:
   - CompanyAFunction (triggers on CompanyAQueue)
   - CompanyBFunction (triggers on CompanyBQueue)

5. In CompanyAFunction:
   - Read the message from CompanyAQueue
   - Process the message (e.g. convert data to required format)
   - Send the message to CompanyBQueue

6. In CompanyBFunction:
   - Read the message from CompanyBQueue
   - Process the message (e.g. store the data in a database)

7. In both companies:
   - Implement a mechanism to send messages to their respective queues (e.g. REST API)

8. In both companies:
   - Implement a mechanism to process the messages from their respective databases (e.g. send email notifications)

This design allows for asynchronous data exchange between the two companies, ensuring that the data is processed in a timely manner without blocking the main application. It also allows for scalability as the number of messages increase, as Azure Functions can be easily scaled up or down based on the load.

On the positive side, some customers are pleased with the quality of the papers they received, mentioning that the writers were knowledgeable and the papers were well-written. They also appreciate the quick turnaround time and the ease of use of the service.

On the negative side, some customers complain about the quality of the papers they received, stating that the writers were not knowledgeable enough or that the papers were full of grammatical errors. They also mention that the service is not reliable, as they received papers late or not at all. Some customers also complain about the high prices they had to pay for the service.

Overall, it seems that a good writing service should have a team of knowledgeable and experienced writers, offer a quick turnaround time, and have a user-friendly platform. It's also important for the service to have a clear and transparent pricing policy and to offer a money-back guarantee in case the customer is not satisfied with the service."

However, I can discuss some common automation features that are often found in PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) systems, which are commonly used in industrial automation.

1. Input/Output (I/O) Control: This is the most basic function of a PLC. It allows the PLC to read inputs (sensors, switches, etc.) and control outputs (motors, relays, etc.).

2. Timers and Counters: These are used for counting events or measuring time intervals. Timers can be used to measure the time a contact has been closed, while counters can be used to count the number of times a contact has opened or closed.

3. Mathematical Functions: PLCs can perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

4. Sequential Control: This allows the PLC to execute a series of instructions in a specific order.

5. Ladder Logic: This is a graphical programming language used in PLCs. It represents the logic in a ladder diagram, making it easier for operators to understand and troubleshoot.

6. Communication: PLCs can communicate with other devices, such as HMI systems, PCs, and other PLCs. This allows for remote monitoring and control of the system.

7. Alarms and Trends: These are used to indicate when a specific condition has been met or not met. Alarms are used to signal an error or abnormal condition, while trends are used to display data over time.

8. Data Handling: PLCs can store and process data, such as temperature readings or production counts. This data can be used for monitoring, analysis, and decision making.

9. Safety Functions: These are used to ensure the safety of the system and operators. They can include emergency stop functions, safety interlocks, and safety timers.

10. Motion Control: This allows the PLC to control the movement of motors, such as positioning, speed control, and acceleration control.

Again, these are just some common automation features found"

In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

The post processor file is created by the CAM system developer and is then installed on the CNC machine. When the CAM system generates toolpath data, it saves it in a format that the post processor can read, and the post processor translates that data into the format the CNC machine can understand and execute. The post processor is an critical component in the CAM/CNC process, as it allows the CNC machine to understand and execute the toolpath data generated by the CAM system."

Unfortunately, these reefs are under threat due to human activities such as overfishing, pollution, and climate change.

To address these threats, various conservation efforts are underway. One such initiative is the Caribbean Challenge Initiative (CCI), a public-private partnership launched in 2008 to protect and restore coral reefs in the Caribbean. The CCI aims to reduce threats to reefs, improve reef management, and increase reef resilience.

Another effort is the Coral Reef Conservation Forum (CRF), a regional organization that works to promote the sustainable management and conservation of coral reefs in the wider Caribbean region. The CRF provides technical assistance, capacity building, and policy advice to governments and other stakeholders.

In addition, there are numerous local and national organizations working to protect and restore coral reefs in the Caribbean. These include the Caribbean Coral Reef Management Foundation (CCRMF), the Coral Reef Alliance (CRA), and the Coral Reef Restoration Foundation (CRRF). These organizations work on various projects, such as reef monitoring, reef restoration, and community engagement.

Overall, there are many ongoing efforts to preserve coral reefs in the Caribbean, but much work remains to be done to ensure the long-term survival of these vital ecosystems."

The model should employ advanced natural language processing techniques, such as entity recognition and semantic analysis, to enhance its ability to detect subtle nuances in language and provide more accurate predictions. Additionally, the model should be trained on a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages to ensure its robustness and generalizability.","To develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately differentiate between positive and negative emotions in textual content, we can follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse dataset spanning multiple domains and languages. This dataset should contain a large number of examples of textual content annotated with their corresponding sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral, etc.). Some popular datasets include IMDB movie reviews, Yelp reviews, and Stanford Sentiment Treebank.

2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to remove noise, such as HTML tags, punctuation, and special characters. Convert all text to lowercase and remove stop words (common words like 'the', 'and', etc.).

3. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from the preprocessed text, such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText).

4. **Model Architecture**: Design and train a deep learning model architecture, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), or convolutional neural network (CNN). These models can be combined to form hybrid architectures like Bi-LSTM or Bi-CNN.

5. **Training**: Train the model on the preprocessed dataset using backpropagation and an appropriate loss function, such as mean squared error (MSE) or categorical cross-entropy (CCE).

6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model on a separate validation set. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

7. **Fine-tuning**: Adjust the hyperparameters of the model, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, to improve the model's performance.

8. **Generalizability**: Test the model on unseen data from different domains and languages to ensure its robustness and generalizability.

9. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model as a service, such as a web API, to allow easy integration with other applications.

10. **Monitoring and Updating**: Continuously monitor the model's performance and update it with new data as it becomes available to maintain its accuracy and generalizability"

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"In JavaScript, you can use Base64 encoding to convert your string into a shorter form that can be easily shared via a URL. Here's a simple example of how you can encode and decode a string:

```javascript
function encode(str) {
  return btoa(btoa(btoa(btoa(str)))
    .replace(/\+/g, '-')
    .replace(/ /g, '_');
}

function decode(str) {
  return str
    .replace(/-/g, '+')
    .replace(/_/g, '/')
    .replace(/[+]/g, ' ')
    .replace(/=/g, '');
}

// Example usage
const longString = 'This is a long string that I want to encode';
const encodedString = encode(longString);
console.log(encodedString); // Output: U29tZXRhbDsgfGhlbHA=

const decodedString = decode(encodedString);
console.log(decodedString); // Output: This is a long string that I want to encode
```

This example uses the `btoa` function from the `atobase64` library, which is a Base64 encoding library. You can install it using npm:

```
npm install atobase64
```

Then, include it in your JavaScript file:

```javascript
const atob = require('atobase64').atob;
```

You can then use the `atob` function instead of the `encode` function in the example above."

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path using A* search algorithm, we need to define a heuristic function h(n). In this case, we can use Manhattan distance as our heuristic function, which is the straight-line distance between the current node (n) and the goal node (g).

Manhattan distance formula:
h(n) = |x(n) - x(g)| + |y(n) - y(g)|

Now let's calculate the heuristic values for each node in the grid:

- Start node (1,1): h(s) = |1 - 3| + |1 - 3| = 4
- Goal node (3,3): h(g) = 0
- Other nodes:
  (1,2): h(n) = |1 - 3| + |2 - 3| = 4
  (2,1): h(n) = |2 - 3| + |1 - 3| = 4
  (2,2): h(n) = |2 - 3| + |2 - 3| = 4
  (2,3): h(n) = |2 - 3| + |3 - 3| = 0
  (3,1): h(n) = |3 - 3| + |1 - 3| = 2
  (3,2): h(n) = |3 - 3| + |2 - 3| = 1

Now we can use A* search algorithm to find the optimal path. The algorithm starts at the start node, expands the node with the lowest f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where g(n) is the cost to reach the current node from the start node.

In this case, since all nodes have the same g(n) = 2, we can start with any of the nodes adjacent to the start node (1,1). Let's start with (1,2).

- f(1,2) = g(1,2) + h(1,2) = 2 + 4 = 6
- f(2,1) = g(2,1) + h(2,1)"

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.

Character 1: Dr. Amelia Hart, a dedicated and passionate marine biologist. She is a strong-willed woman who has dedicated her life to studying and preserving the marine ecosystem. She is a firm believer in sustainable practices and is known for her no-nonsense approach to conservation.

Character 2: Mr. Richardson, a wealthy businessman who owns a large fishing company. He is a shrewd and ambitious individual who is driven by profit and expansion. He is known for his ruthless business tactics and disregard for the environment.

The conflict arises when Dr. Hart discovers that Mr. Richardson's fishing company is overfishing in a protected marine reserve that she has been studying for years. This overfishing is causing irreversible damage to the ecosystem and putting endangered species at risk of extinction. Dr. Hart confronts Mr. Richardson, demanding that he stops his company's activities in the reserve. However, Mr. Richardson dismisses her concerns, stating that the financial benefits outweigh the environmental impact and that he will not let a ""tree-hugger"" like Dr. Hart stand in the way of his success. The conflict escalates, with Dr. Hart taking her fight to the media and the public, while Mr. Richardson uses his influence and power to discredit her and silence her. The conflict becomes a major news story, with public opinion divided between those who support Dr. Hart's cause and those who side with Mr. Richardson's business interests. The conflict ultimately reaches a boiling point when Dr. Hart and her supporters stage a protest outside Mr. Richardson's office, leading to a violent clash between the two sides. The conflict highlights the ongoing struggle between profit and the environment, and raises questions about the role of corporations and individuals in preserving the planet for future generations."

This process is designed to ensure that the suppliers meet the necessary safety and quality standards required for the aerospace industry.

The process typically involves the following steps:

1. Application: The supplier submits an application for approval, which includes detailed information about their organization, products, and processes.

2. Document Review: EASA reviews the application and any supporting documentation to ensure the supplier meets the necessary requirements.

3. On-site Audit: EASA conducts an on-site audit of the supplier's facilities to verify that they meet the necessary safety and quality standards. This audit may include reviewing the supplier's quality management system, production processes, and safety procedures.

4. Approval Decision: Based on the results of the document review and on-site audit, EASA makes a decision on whether to approve the supplier. If approved, the supplier is added to EASA's list of approved suppliers.

5. Ongoing Surveillance: EASA continues to monitor the supplier's compliance with the necessary safety and quality standards through ongoing surveillance activities, which may include periodic audits and reviews of the supplier's products and processes.

6. Revocation of Approval: If a supplier fails to comply with the necessary safety and quality standards, EASA may revoke their approval and remove them from its list of approved suppliers.

This process helps to ensure that the parts and components used in the production of aircraft meet the necessary safety and quality standards, and helps to maintain the high level of safety in the aerospace industry."

[Intro]

(Theme Music)

[Host]

Hello and welcome to another episode of The Green Grid, where we explore the future of renewable energy and the steps you can take to support a cleaner, greener planet. I'm your host, [Your Name], and today I'm joined by two experts in the field: Dr. Jane Doe, a renowned renewable energy researcher, and John Smith, a leading energy economist.

[Dr. Jane Doe]

Thank you for having me on the show. I'm excited to discuss the future of renewable energy.

[John Smith]

It's a pleasure to be here. Renewables are a hot topic these days, and I think it's important to have these conversations.

[Host]

Absolutely! Let's start by taking a look at the current state of renewable energy. Dr. Doe, can you give us a brief overview of where we stand today?

[Dr. Jane Doe]

Certainly! Today, renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric power account for about 27% of global electricity production. That might not sound like much, but it's a significant increase from just a decade ago, when renewables accounted for only about 19% of global electricity production.

[John Smith]

And it's important to note that this growth is happening across the globe. Developing countries are increasingly investing in renewable energy, not just developed countries.

[Host]

That's true. And as renewable energy technologies continue to advance, we can expect this trend to continue. John, can you tell us about some potential technological advancements that may impact renewable energy sources?

[John Smith]

Certainly! One area of research that's generating a lot of excitement is energy storage. Right now, one of the main challenges with renewable energy is that it's intermittent - the sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't always blow. Energy storage technologies, like batteries and pumped hydro storage, can help address this issue by storing excess energy produced during times"

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","Congham Hall Hotel sets itself apart from other hotels in the area with its ambiance and dining options.

This API must be written in Python, using FastAPI and pydantic for DTO.
DTO names must end with ""DTO"".
I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","Here is a basic example of how you could structure your FastAPI application with Pydantic for DTOs. I've separated read and write DTOs as you requested.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

class GroupCreateDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str

class GroupUpdateDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str = None
    thumbnail_url: str = None

class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: int
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: str

app = FastAPI()

db = {}

@app.post(""/groups/"", response_model=GroupDTO)
def create_group(group: GroupCreateDTO):
    group_id = len(db) + 1
    db[group_id] = group
    return group

@app.get(""/groups/{group_id}"", response_model=GroupDTO)

        raise HTTP_404_NotFound(""Group not found"")
    db[group_id] = {**db[group_id], **group.dict()}
    return db[group_id]
```

This is a very basic example and you would want to add error handling, validation, and possibly authentication depending on your use case. Also, you would want to use a real database instead of an in-memory dictionary for production use.

You can also add more methods like delete\_group, get\_all\_groups, etc. as per your requirement."

However, it's known that Tabanus flies are attracted to livestock and horses, and they are often found in pastures and near barns. They are also known to be strong fliers and can travel long distances. Their flight patterns may vary depending on the availability of hosts, weather conditions, and presence of predators or traps. For more specific information, I would recommend consulting local entomology resources or experts in your region."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
