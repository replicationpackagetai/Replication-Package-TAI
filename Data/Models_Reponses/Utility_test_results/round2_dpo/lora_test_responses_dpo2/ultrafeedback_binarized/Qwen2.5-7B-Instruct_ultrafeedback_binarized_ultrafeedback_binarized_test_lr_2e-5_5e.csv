When you encounter a 404 error while running `docker-compose up`, it's usually not directly related to the HTTP 404 error you might see in a web application, but rather an issue with your Docker Compose setup. Here are some common reasons and troubleshooting steps:

1. **Incorrect Service Name**:
   - Ensure that the service name you are trying to start exists in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Example: If you are trying to start a service named `web`, make sure it exists in your `docker-compose.yml`.

2. **Incorrect Command**:
   - Double-check the command you are using. The correct command is `docker-compose up` (without any service name) to start all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - If you want to start a specific service, use `docker-compose up <service-name>`.

3. **Missing or Incorrect Configuration**:
   - Verify that your `docker-compose.yml` file is correctly configured.
   - Ensure that the service definitions are correct and that all required dependencies are properly defined.

4. **Network Issues**:
   - Check if the service is running and accessible within the Docker network.
   - You can use `docker ps` to list running containers and `docker-compose ps` to see the status of all services.

5. **Port Mappings**:
   - Ensure that the port mappings are correctly defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - If you are trying to access a service from outside Docker, make sure the port is correctly mapped and accessible.

6. **Build Issues**:
   - If you have a `dockerfile` in your project, ensure that the build process is successful.
   - You can run `docker-compose build` to rebuild the images before starting the services.

7. **Logs and Debugging**:
   - Check the logs for more detailed information about what might be going wrong. Use `docker-compose logs <service-name>` to view logs for a specific service.
   - You can also increase the verbosity of the `docker-compose` command by adding the `-v` or `--verbose` flag.

8. **File Path Issues**:
   - Ensure that the `docker-compose.yml` file is in the correct directory or provide the full path to the file if it's in a different directory.

The author's emotional state appears to be one of frustration, isolation, and perhaps a sense of being trapped or overlooked. The use of the term ""ruined fort"" suggests a feeling of decay or loss, while ""inaccessible"" implies a sense of being isolated or difficult to reach. This could be metaphorical, referring to the author's feelings of being disconnected from others or society at large."

Here are some guidelines to help you determine the appropriate number of plants:

1. **Space Size**: Measure the square footage of your closet office. A general rule of thumb is to have one large plant or three small plants for every 100 square feet (9.3 square meters) of space.

2. **Types of Plants**: Some plants are more effective at removing certain pollutants. NASA's Clean Air Study identified several plants that are particularly good at improving air quality:
   - **Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)**
   - **Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)**
   - **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)**
   - **Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica)**
   - **Boston Fern (Nephrolepis exaltata)**
   - **English Ivy (Hedera helix)**

3. **Air Quality Concerns**: If you have specific air quality concerns (e.g., formaldehyde, benzene, or trichloroethylene), choose plants that are known to remove those pollutants.

4. **Lighting**: Consider the lighting conditions in your closet office. Some plants require more light than others. For low-light conditions, choose plants like the snake plant or peace lily.

### Example Calculation:
- If your closet office is 100 square feet (9.3 square meters), you would need 1 large plant or 3 small plants.
- If it's 200 square feet (18.6 square meters), you would need 2 large plants or 6 small plants.

### Additional Tips:
- **Air Purifiers**: While plants can help, they may not be sufficient for larger spaces or more severe air quality issues. Consider using an air purifier in conjunction with plants.
- **Maintenance**: Ensure you can maintain the plants properly, as overwatering or neglect can harm them and potentially worsen air quality.

By considering these factors, you can determine the appropriate number of plants to improve the air quality in your closet office."

Moreover, could you share a Ruby script capable of producing a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table?","To create a comprehensive comparison chart in HTML table format between traditional education and online education, taking into account the aspects of cost, flexibility, interaction, resources, and learning outcomes, using Ruby code, you can follow these steps:
1. Create an HTML table with the required columns and rows.
2. Use Ruby to populate the table with the relevant information.
Here's an example Ruby script that creates an HTML table and populates it with the required information:
```ruby
# Define the table headers
headers = [""Aspect"", ""Traditional Education"", ""Online Education""]
# Define the table rows
rows = [
  [""Cost"", ""Higher"", ""Lower""],
  [""Flexibility"", ""Less"", ""More""],
  [""Interaction"", ""In-person"", ""Virtual""],
  [""Resources"", ""Limited"", ""Abundant""],
  [""Learning Outcomes"", ""Varies"", ""Varies""]
]
# Create the HTML table
html_table = ""<table>""
html_table += ""<tr>""
headers.each do |header|
  html_table += ""<th>#{header}</th>""
end
html_table += ""</tr>""
rows.each do |row|
  html_table += ""<tr>""
  row.each do |cell|
    html_table += ""<td>#{cell}</td>""
  end
  html_table += ""</tr>""
end
html_table += ""</table>""
# Output the HTML table
puts html_table
```
To create a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table, you can use a Ruby gem like `gruff`. Here's an example script that creates a bar graph using the `gruff` gem:
```ruby
require 'gruff'
# Define the data for the bar graph
data = {
  ""Traditional Education"" => [2, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  ""Online Education"" => [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
}
# Create a new bar graph
graph = Gruff::Bar.new
# Set the title and labels for the graph
graph.title = ""Comparison of Traditional and Online Education""
graph.labels = {0 => ""Cost"", 1 => ""Flexibility"", 2 => ""Interaction"", 3 => ""Resources"", 4 => ""Learning Outcomes""}
# Add the data to the graph
data.each do |name, values|
  graph.data(name, values)
end
# Save the graph"

However, `v.ParentName` is not a valid property or method in Lua or Luau.

If you want to access the `Parent` property of an object and then get the `Name` of that parent, you would do it like this:

```lua
local parentName = v.Parent.Name

Here's how you can set it up:

### 1. **Edit the sudoers File**

The `sudoers` file controls who can run what commands as what users. You should always edit this file with the `visudo` command to avoid syntax errors that could prevent sudo from working at all.

```bash
sudo visudo
```

### 2. **Add the Passwordless Rule**

You can add a rule to allow a specific user or group to run commands without a password. Here are a few examples:

#### For a Specific User:
To allow the user `username` to run all commands without a password, add the following line:

```bash
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

#### For a Specific Command:
To allow the user `username` to run only specific commands without a password, add the following line:

```bash
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/command1, /usr/bin/command2
```

#### For a Specific User and Host:
To allow the user `username` to run commands without a password only from a specific host, add the following line:

```bash
username host=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

### 3. **Save and Exit**

After adding the rule, save the file and exit the editor. In `visudo`, you can usually do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` to confirm, and `Enter` to save.

### 4. **Test the Configuration**

You can test the configuration by running a command with sudo and checking if it works without prompting for a password.

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/command1
```

### 5. **Security Considerations**

- **Limit the Scope**: Only grant passwordless sudo access for necessary commands and users.
- **Monitor Usage**: Keep an eye on sudo logs to detect any unauthorized usage.
- **Use Groups**: Instead of individual users, consider using groups to manage access.
- **Regular Audits**: Regularly review and update the `sudoers` file to ensure it remains secure.

### Example of a Group-Based Rule

If you want to allow all members of a group to run commands without a password, you can add a rule like this:"

Lastly, submission with ['id', 'label]. Label consists 0 to 7, and the text column consists of news article data. Write some codes about augmentation, then, classifies via keras with other models ensembled. Validation must be f1 macro.","Sure, let's break down the task into several steps:

1. **Data Augmentation**: We can use techniques like text transformation (e.g., synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap, random deletion) to augment the training dataset.
2. **Model Training**: We will train several models using Keras and ensemble their predictions.
3. **Validation**: We will use F1 macro as the validation metric.

Here's a step-by-step implementation:

### Step 1: Data Augmentation

We'll use the `transformers` library for text augmentation. Specifically, we'll use the `TextAttack` library which provides a simple way to perform text augmentation.

```python
!pip install textattack
```

```python
import pandas as pd
from textattack.augmentation import Augmenter
from textattack.transformations import WordSwapRandomSwap, WordSwapWordNet
from textattack.augmentation import Augmenter

# Load the dataset
train_df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('test.csv')

# Define the augmentation
transformation = [WordSwapRandomSwap(), WordSwapWordNet()]
augmenter = Augmenter(transformation=transformation, num_aug=5)

# Apply augmentation
augmented_texts = []
for text in train_df['text']:
    augmented_texts.extend(augmenter.augment(text))

# Combine original and augmented texts
train_df['augmented_text'] = augmented_texts
train_df['augmented_label'] = train_df['label'].repeat(5)
train_df = train_df.drop_duplicates(subset=['id'])
```

### Step 2: Model Training and Ensemble

We'll train several models and ensemble their predictions. We'll use Keras for model training.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense, Dropout
from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Tokenize and pad the text

tokenizer.fit_on_texts(train_df['augmented_text'].tolist() + test_df['text'].tolist())
train_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(train_df['augmented_text'])

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy contracted by 20.4% in April, May, and June due to the coronavirus lockdown, performing worse than other major industrial nations, with Scotland experiencing a slighter smaller decline of 19.4%."

Here are some scenarios:

1. **Literal `=`**: If you want to match the `=` symbol literally, you do not need to escape it. For example:
    ```python
    import re

    pattern = ""=""
    text = ""a=b=c""
    matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
    print(matches)  # Output: ['=', '=']
    ```

2. **Special Meaning**: The `=` symbol has a special meaning in some contexts, such as in lookbehind assertions or when used in certain constructs. In these cases, you would need to escape it:
    ```python
    import re

    # Lookbehind assertion
    pattern = ""(?<=a=)b""
    text = ""a=b c=a=d""
    matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
    print(matches)  # Output: ['b']
    ```

In general, if you want to match the `=` symbol literally, you do not need to escape it. However, if you are using `=` in a context where it has a special meaning, you should escape it with a backslash (`\`).

Here is an example where escaping is necessary:
```python
import re

pattern = ""\\=""
text = ""a\\=b""
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['\\=']
```

In this case, the backslash is used to escape the backslash itself, and the `=` is matched literally."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that Donald Trump has broken a presidential record by playing golf more than 70 times during his first year in office. Kimmel used this fact to highlight his critique of Trump's accomplishments, suggesting that while many people claim Trump hasn't achieved anything significant, he has spent a considerable amount of time on leisure activities like golf rather than focusing on policy-making and governance. Kimmel's statement implies that Trump's priorities may not align with the public's expectations for a president's time in office."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating. 
 Answer: is fond of collecting family life photographs

Nestled in a small village surrounded by rolling hills and lush green fields, it is a place that feels like a haven from the hustle and bustle of city life.

As soon as I step through the front door, I am greeted by the warm and inviting scent of freshly baked bread and the sound of laughter and chatter from the kitchen. The house is filled with the memories of my childhood, from the cozy living room where we would gather to watch movies and play board games, to the sunroom where we would sip tea and chat about life.

But what I love most about my grandmother's house is the garden. It is a sprawling expanse of colorful flowers, fragrant herbs, and towering trees that provide shade and shelter. I can spend hours wandering through the garden, picking fresh herbs to add to my grandmother's famous tomato sauce or admiring the vibrant blooms that seem to change with the seasons.

The garden is also a place where I can find peace and solace. When I am feeling stressed or overwhelmed, I can retreat to the garden and breathe in the fresh air, listen to the birds singing, and feel the warmth of the sun on my skin. It is a place where I can let go of my worries and simply be present in the moment.

My grandmother's house is more than just a physical place - it is a source of comfort, joy, and love. It is a place where I feel safe and loved, and where I can be myself without judgment. Whenever I visit, I leave with a sense of contentment and gratitude, knowing that I have been blessed to have such a special place in my life."

Sails are typically made of materials such as canvas, polyester, nylon, or other synthetic fabrics. These materials are visible and tangible. However, the force that propels a sailboat is indeed invisible, as it is generated by the wind, which is a movement of air molecules. Here are some key points to clarify this:

1. **Sail Material**: Sails are constructed from visible, tangible materials like fabric, not air.

2. **Wind and Air Movement**: The wind, which is the driving force behind a sailboat, is made up of moving air molecules. This movement is invisible to the naked eye.

3. **Sail Shape and Aerodynamics**: The shape and design of the sail, along with the angle at which it is set relative to the wind, manipulate the air flow to generate lift, which propels the boat forward. This process is not visible but can be understood through principles of aerodynamics.

4. **Visible Effects**: While the wind itself is invisible, the effects of the wind on the sail and the resulting movement of the boat are visible.

In summary, sails are made of visible materials, but the force that drives them (the wind) is invisible."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

34b6024ac1ebc841999efdc9498dedf8eb7fdfc0754384511648485f9ec2c7bb,in javascript i have a long string (up to 100 characters). I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string into a short, shareable string in JavaScript, you can use various encoding techniques such as Base64 or URL-safe Base64. Base64 encoding is a common method to encode binary data to an ASCII string format. However, Base64 strings can still be quite long, so you might want to use URL-safe Base64 encoding to make them more suitable for URLs.

Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. **Base64 Encoding**: Convert the string to a Base64 encoded string.
2. **URL-Safe Base64 Encoding**: Modify the Base64 string to make it URL-safe by replacing `+` with `-` and `/` with `_`.

### Step 1: Base64 Encoding

You can use the `btoa` function in JavaScript to encode a string to Base64.

### Step 2: URL-Safe Base64 Encoding

You can create a custom function to replace `+` and `/` with `-` and `_`.

### Example Code

```javascript
function base64Encode(input) {
    return btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(input)));
}

function base64Decode(input) {
    return decodeURIComponent(escape(atob(input)));
}

// Example usage
const originalString = ""This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";
const encodedString = base64Encode(originalString);
console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);

const decodedString = base64Decode(encodedString);
console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);
```

### Explanation

1. **`base64Encode` Function**:
   - `encodeURIComponent` encodes the string to handle special characters.
   - `unescape` decodes the encoded string.
   - `btoa` converts the decoded string to a Base64 encoded string.

2. **`base64Decode` Function**:
   - `atob` converts the Base64 encoded string back to a binary string.
   - `escape` encodes the binary string to handle special characters.
   - `decodeURIComponent` decodes the encoded string.

### URL-Safe Base64 Encoding (Optional)

If you want to make the Base64 string URL-safe, you can modify the `base64Encode` and `base64Decode` functions as follows:

```javascript
function urlSafeBase64"

Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node using heuristic search, we can use the A* search algorithm. A* search uses a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal, which in this case is the Manhattan distance (also known as taxicab or city block distance).

The heuristic function \( h(n) \) for a node \( n \) is the Manhattan distance from \( n \) to the goal node (3,3).

Let's calculate the heuristic values for each node:

- \( h(1,1) = |1-3| + |1-3| = 4 \)
- \( h(1,2) = |1-3| + |2-3| = 3 \)
- \( h(1,3) = |1-3| + |3-3| = 2 \)
- \( h(1,4) = |1-3| + |4-3| = 3 \)
- \( h(1,5) = |1-3| + |5-3| = 4 \)
- \( h(2,1) = |2-3| + |1-3| = 3 \)
- \( h(2,2) = |2-3| + |2-3| = 2 \)
- \( h(2,3) = |2-3| + |3-3| = 1 \)
- \( h(2,4) = |2-3| + |4-3| = 2 \)
- \( h(2,5) = |2-3| + |5-3| = 3 \)

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz and achieve the ideal foam and bloom, follow these steps and tips:

### Ingredients:
- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz egg white
- 1 oz lemon juice
- 1 oz lime juice
- 1 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz orange flower water
- 1 oz cream
- Soda water (Topo Chico recommended)
- Ice cubes (small, about 3)

### Equipment:
- Cocktail shaker
- Collins glass

### Instructions:

1. **Dry Shake:**
   - Add gin, egg white, lemon juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your cocktail shaker.
   - Shake vigorously without adding ice for about 2 minutes. This helps emulsify the egg white and mix the ingredients thoroughly. The vigorous shaking also helps create a stable foam.

2. **Add Ice and Shake Again:**
   - Add a small amount of ice (about 3 small cubes) to the shaker.
   - Shake again until the mixture is well-chilled or until the ice has mostly melted. This ensures the drink is cold and the ingredients are fully combined.

3. **Strain and Serve:**
   - Pour soda water into a Collins glass first.
   - Strain the cocktail over the soda water.
   - Optionally, you can use a fine mesh strainer to catch any egg white foam that might have separated.

### Tips for Achieving the Ideal Foam and Bloom:

1. **Vigorous Dry Shake:**
   - The key to achieving the perfect foam is the vigorous dry shake. This helps create a stable foam that will rise to the top of the drink.

2. **Proper Egg White Emulsification:**
   - Ensure the egg white is fully emulsified with the other ingredients. This will help create a smooth, creamy foam.

3. **Use Small Ice Cubes:**
   - Using smaller ice cubes can help create smaller bubbles, which can contribute to a more delicate foam.

4. **Shake Time:**
   - The shaking time can vary, but a good rule of thumb is to shake for about 2 minutes. This gives the egg white enough time to emulsify and the mixture to become frothy.

5. **Strain with Care:**
   - When straining, use a fine mesh strainer to catch any egg white foam that might have separated."

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.

A group has the following properties: uid, name, thumbnail\_url, creation\_date
This API must be written in Python, using FastAPI and pydantic for DTO.
DTO names must end with ""DTO"".
I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","Certainly! Below is an example of a REST API using FastAPI and Pydantic to manage groups of users. The API will include separate DTOs for read and write operations.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

First, ensure you have FastAPI and Uvicorn installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

### Step 2: Define DTOs

We'll define two DTOs: one for creating or updating groups (`GroupWriteDTO`) and another for reading groups (`GroupReadDTO`).

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class GroupWriteDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., description=""Name of the group"")
    thumbnail_url: str = Field(..., description=""Thumbnail URL of the group"")
    creation_date: str = Field(..., description=""Creation date of the group in ISO format"")

class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: int = Field(..., description=""Unique identifier of the group"")
    name: str = Field(..., description=""Name of the group"")
    thumbnail_url: str = Field(..., description=""Thumbnail URL of the group"")
    creation_date: str = Field(..., description=""Creation date of the group in ISO format"")
```

### Step 3: Define the FastAPI Application

Now, let's define the FastAPI application with endpoints to manage groups.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional

app = FastAPI()

# In-memory storage for groups
groups = []

# Dependency to get the current group by UID
def get_group(uid: int) -> Optional[GroupReadDTO]:
    for group in groups:
        if group.uid == uid:
            return group
    return None

# Dependency to get the current group by UID for write operations
def get_group_for_write(uid: int) -> Optional[GroupWriteDTO]:
    for group in groups:
        if group.uid == uid:
            return group
    return None

# Endpoint to create a new group
@app.post(""/groups/"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
def create_group(group: GroupWriteDTO):
    group.uid = len(groups) + 1
    groups.append(group)
    return group

# Endpoint to get a group by UID
@app.get(""/groups/{uid}"", response_model=Group"

These differences can be influenced by various factors, including climate, availability of hosts, and local ecosystems. Here are some general observations:

1. **Climate and Seasonality**: In regions with distinct seasons, Tabanus species may have different flight patterns. For example, in temperate regions, they might be more active during the warmer months, while in tropical regions, they could be active year-round.

2. **Host Availability**: The abundance and distribution of hosts (such as horses, cattle, and other animals) can influence flight patterns. In areas with a high density of hosts, Tabanus may be more concentrated in those areas, leading to more frequent flights in those regions.

3. **Elevation and Topography**: In mountainous regions, flight patterns might differ based on elevation. For instance, Tabanus species might be more common in lower elevations where temperatures are warmer and hosts are more abundant.

4. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Some Tabanus species have evolved specific behaviors to cope with different environments. For example, some species might be more diurnal (active during the day) in regions with less predation pressure, while others might be more nocturnal (active at night) in areas with higher predation risk.

5. **Migration Patterns**: Some Tabanus species may exhibit migration patterns, moving from one region to another based on seasonal changes or availability of hosts. This can lead to differences in flight patterns between regions.

While these differences exist, it's important to note that more detailed studies are needed to fully understand the specific flight patterns and behaviors of different Tabanus species across various regions."

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.

Student:","3

The third passage mentions Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the husband of Joanna I of Naples and the son of King Charles I of Hungary. This passage provides a context that could be used to search for further information about the number of kings Hungary had before Andrew's father, King Charles I of Hungary. Therefore, Passage 3 is the correct choice."
