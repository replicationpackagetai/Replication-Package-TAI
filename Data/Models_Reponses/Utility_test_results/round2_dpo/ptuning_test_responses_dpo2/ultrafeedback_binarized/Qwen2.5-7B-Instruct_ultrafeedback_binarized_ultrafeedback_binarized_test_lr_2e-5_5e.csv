When running `docker-compose up`, this error might not be directly related to Docker or Docker Compose, but rather to the services or applications defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Here are some common reasons and troubleshooting steps for a 404 error when running `docker-compose up`:

1. **Service Not Defined Correctly**:
   - Ensure that the service you are trying to access is correctly defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Check if the service name matches the one you are trying to access.

2. **Service Not Running**:
   - Make sure that the service is up and running. You can use `docker-compose ps` to check the status of your services.
   - If the service is not running, use `docker-compose up --build` to build and start the service.

3. **Incorrect URL or Endpoint**:
   - If you are trying to access an application running inside a container, ensure that you are using the correct URL or endpoint.
   - For example, if you have a web service running on `http://localhost:8080`, make sure that the service is actually running on that port.

4. **Network Configuration**:
   - Docker Compose creates a default network for the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Ensure that the service you are trying to access is part of the default network or that you have configured the correct network settings.

5. **Service Not Exposing Ports**:
   - Check if the service is exposing the correct ports. You can use `docker-compose ps` to see the ports exposed by the service.
   - If the service is not exposing the correct ports, you can add the `ports` configuration in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

6. **Service Configuration Issues**:
   - Check the configuration files of the service (e.g., `nginx.conf`, `application.properties`) for any misconfigurations.
   - Ensure that the service is configured to listen on the correct host and port.

7. **Logs and Debugging**:
   - Check the logs of the service using `docker-compose logs <service_name>` to see if there are any errors or issues.
   - Use `docker-compose up --force-recreate --build` to recreate and rebuild the containers.

8. **Environment Variables**:"

The author's emotional state appears to be one of isolation, desolation, and perhaps a sense of being trapped or abandoned. The metaphor of a ""ruined fort, inacessible"" suggests feelings of being cut off from others or society, and possibly a sense of hopelessness or despair. The use of such a stark and negative image indicates a deep emotional turmoil or dissatisfaction with the current situation."

However, a good rule of thumb is to have at least one large plant or several smaller plants for every 100 square feet (9.3 square meters) of space.

NASA's Clean Air Study, which is often referenced for its findings on air-purifying plants, suggests that a variety of plants can help remove common indoor air pollutants like formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Size of the Closet Office**: Measure the dimensions of your closet office to determine its square footage. For example, if your closet office is 8 feet by 10 feet (80 square feet), you would need about 8-10 plants.

2. **Types of Plants**: Some effective air-purifying plants include:
   - **Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)**
   - **Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)**
   - **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)**
   - **Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica)**
   - **Boston Fern (Nephrolepis exaltata)**
   - **Dracaena (Dracaena spp.)**

3. **Placement**: Place plants in strategic locations to maximize their effectiveness. Ensure they have enough light and space to grow well.

4. **Maintenance**: Regularly water, prune, and care for your plants to keep them healthy and effective at purifying the air.

For a small closet office, you might start with 3-5 plants, and for a larger space, you could have 8-10 or more. Remember, the more plants you have, the better the air quality will be, but even a few well-chosen plants can make a noticeable difference."

Moreover, could you share a Ruby script capable of producing a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table?","To create a comprehensive comparison chart in HTML table format between traditional education and online education, you can use Ruby to generate the HTML code. Here's an example script:
```ruby
# Define the data for the comparison chart
data = {
  cost: {
    traditional: ""Varies by institution, but typically more expensive"",
    online: ""Generally more affordable, but may require additional technology costs""
  },
  flexibility: {
    traditional: ""Less flexible, typically requires attending classes in person at specific times"",
    online: ""More flexible, can access course materials and participate in discussions at any time""
  },
  interaction: {
    traditional: ""More face-to-face interaction with instructors and peers"",
    online: ""Less face-to-face interaction, but can use discussion forums and video conferencing""
  },
  resources: {
    traditional: ""Access to physical resources such as libraries and labs"",
    online: ""Access to digital resources such as online databases and virtual labs""
  },
  learning_outcomes: {
    traditional: ""Varies by institution, but typically emphasizes face-to-face interaction and hands-on learning"",
    online: ""Varies by institution, but typically emphasizes self-directed learning and digital literacy""

# Generate the HTML table
html = ""<table>\n""
html += ""  <tr>\n""
html += ""    <th></th>\n""
html += ""    <th>Traditional Education</th>\n""
html += ""    <th>Online Education</th>\n""
html += ""  </tr>\n""
data.each do |aspect, values|
  html += ""  <tr>\n""
  html += ""    <td>#{aspect.capitalize}</td>\n""
  values.each do |model, description|
    html += ""    <td>#{description}</td>\n""
  end
  html += ""  </tr>\n""
end
html += ""</table>""
# Output the HTML table
puts html
```
This script defines the data for the comparison chart as a hash with keys for each aspect and values for each education model. It then generates an HTML table with the data and outputs the HTML code.
To create a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table, you can use a Ruby gem like `gruff`. Here's an example script:
```ruby
require 'gruff'

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

I am having difficulties with the older students complaining about the younger students and being disrespectful towards them. What are some teaching strategies or activities that encourage team building and bonding between band students?,"Managing a diverse age range in a band class can indeed present unique challenges, but fostering a positive and collaborative environment is crucial. Here are some strategies and activities that can help encourage team building and bonding between your band students:

### 1. **Common Goals and Challenges**
   - **Set Clear Goals:** Make sure all students understand the importance of each other in achieving the band's goals. Discuss how each part of the music contributes to the whole.
   - **Group Challenges:** Create activities where the entire band must work together to solve a problem or achieve a goal. For example, a ""musical scavenger hunt"" where students have to find and play specific notes or rhythms.

### 2. **Team Building Activities**
   - **Icebreakers:** Start each class with a quick icebreaker activity. This could be as simple as a ""get to know you"" game or a quick round of ""two truths and a lie.""
   - **Team Games:** Incorporate games that require teamwork, such as relay races, where students must pass a baton (or a musical instrument) from one to another without dropping it.

### 3. **Role Reversals**
   - **Mentorship Programs:** Pair older students with younger ones for mentorship. This can help older students feel valued and can provide younger students with guidance and support.
   - **Teaching Roles:** Have older students teach a section of music to the younger students. This not only helps with learning but also builds respect and understanding.

### 4. **Collaborative Projects**
   - **Group Compositions:** Encourage students to work in groups to create a piece of music. This can help them understand the importance of collaboration and compromise.
   - **Arrangement Projects:** Assign different sections of a piece to different groups and have them arrange it. This can help students appreciate the work of others and the complexity of music.

### 5. **Positive Reinforcement**
   - **Recognition:** Regularly recognize and praise students for their contributions and positive interactions. This can help foster a culture of appreciation.
   - **Feedback Sessions:** Hold regular feedback sessions where students can give and receive constructive criticism in a supportive environment.

### 6. **Classroom Management Techniques**
   - **Establish Rules and Consequences:** Clearly outline expectations and consequences for disrespectful behavior. Make sure these are consistently enforced.
   - **Conflict Resolution:** Teach students how to resolve conflicts peacefully. This could be through role"

1. **Hormonal Imbalance**: Low body fat can disrupt hormonal balance, particularly affecting estrogen levels. This can lead to irregular menstrual cycles, amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), and other reproductive issues.

2. **Metabolic Issues**: A very low body fat percentage can affect metabolism, potentially leading to fatigue, decreased energy levels, and difficulty maintaining body temperature.

3. **Bone Health**: Low body fat can contribute to osteoporosis or osteopenia due to reduced estrogen levels, which are important for bone health.

4. **Muscle Mass**: While low body fat is generally desirable for certain athletic pursuits, extremely low body fat can lead to muscle wasting and loss of muscle mass.

5. **Immune Function**: A healthy body fat percentage is important for maintaining a robust immune system. Very low body fat can compromise immune function, making the body more susceptible to infections.

6. **Psychological Impact**: Low body fat can lead to body image issues and eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, which can have severe psychological and physical consequences.

7. **Reproductive Health**: Low body fat can affect fertility and overall reproductive health, as it is necessary for the production of hormones that support pregnancy and menstruation.

If a woman's body fat percentage is consistently below 16%, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider to assess overall health and address any underlying issues that may be contributing to this low percentage. This can help ensure that the individual is receiving appropriate care and support."

However, `v.ParentName` is not a valid syntax in Lua or Luau.

If you want to access the `Parent` property of an object and then access a property of that parent, you would do it like this:

```lua
local parentName = v.Parent.Name
```

Here, `v.Parent` accesses the parent of the object `v`, and `.Name` accesses the `Name` property of that parent.

If you want to access a custom property called `ParentName` of the parent, it would look like this:

```lua
local parentName = v.Parent.ParentName
```

But if `ParentName` is not a property of the parent, you will need to define it first. For example:

```lua
v.Parent.ParentName = ""SomeName""
local parentName = v.Parent.ParentName
```

In this case, `v.Parent.ParentName` accesses the `ParentName` property of the parent of `v`.

Make sure that the properties you are trying to access exist and are correctly spelled."

### 1. **Edit the Sudoers File**
   - The sudoers file is located at `/etc/sudoers`. You should always edit this file with the `visudo` command to ensure the syntax is correct and to prevent accidental lockouts.

   ```bash
   sudo visudo
   ```

### 2. **Add the Passwordless Sudo Rule**
   - You can add a rule to allow a specific user to run all commands without a password. For example, to allow the user `john` to run all commands without a password, you would add the following line:

   ```bash
   john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

   - If you want to allow a specific command without a password, you can specify the command instead of `ALL`. For example:

   ```bash
   john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get
   ```

### 3. **Save and Exit**
   - After adding the rule, save the file and exit the editor. In `visudo`, you can use `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` to confirm the changes, and `Enter` to exit.

### 4. **Test the Configuration**
   - You can test the configuration by logging in as the user and running a command with `sudo`:

   ```bash
   sudo whoami
   ```

   - If the configuration is correct, you should not be prompted for a password.

### 5. **Optional: Allow a Group to Run Commands Without Password**
   - If you want to allow all members of a specific group to run commands without a password, you can modify the rule to include the group. For example, to allow all members of the `wheel` group to run all commands without a password:

   ```bash
   %wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

### 6. **Security Considerations**
   - **Use with Caution**: Allowing passwordless sudo can be a security risk, especially if the user or group has access to sensitive commands. Ensure that the user or group has the minimum necessary permissions.
   - **Monitor Usage**: Regularly review the sudo logs to monitor who is"

Chip Livingston's poem ""The Jacaranda Blooms,"" recorded for Poem-a-Day on January 21, 2016, evokes a vivid and almost surreal scene centered around a jacaranda tree. The poem begins by describing the vibrant and perhaps intoxicated appearance of the jacaranda, which is compared to a ""drunk stick tree."" It then calls out to the reader, inviting them to come and see, with the jacaranda's violent violet petals described as if they are weeping pollen. The poem also introduces the sound of a ""bichofeo"" (likely a bird) singing passionately about the jacaranda. The speaker then reflects on the beauty of the blooming tree, seeing it swell with nectar and hearing its shrill cries. Overall, the poem captures the sensory and emotional impact of the jacaranda's blooming, blending natural imagery with a sense of urgency and invitation."

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy contracted by 20.4% in April, May, and June due to the coronavirus lockdown, performing worse than other major industrial nations, with Scotland experiencing a slighter smaller decline but still facing significant industry contractions."

For example:

- If you want to match the literal `=` character, you do not need to escape it:
  ```python
  import re
  result = re.search(r'=', 'a=b')
  print(result)  # <re.Match object; span=(2, 3), match='='>
  ```

- However, if you are using `=` as part of a special regex pattern (like a quantifier or a character class), you would need to escape it:
  ```python
  import re
  # This will not match anything because the pattern is invalid
  result = re.search(r'=+', 'a=b')
  print(result)  # None

  # Escaping the = to match it literally
  result = re.search(r'\=+', 'a=b')
  print(result)  # <re.Match object; span=(2, 3), match='='>
  ```

In summary, for matching a literal `=` character, you do not need to escape it. Only escape it if it is part of a special regex pattern where it has a different meaning."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that Donald Trump has broken a presidential record by playing golf more than 70 times during his first year in office. This statistic serves as a backdrop for Kimmel's critique of Trump's accomplishments, suggesting that while Trump has spent significant time on leisure activities, he has not achieved much in terms of policy. Kimmel implies that instead of golfing, Trump could have focused more on substantive policy work, especially given the challenges facing the country, such as healthcare reform. By highlighting Trump's golfing record, Kimmel underscores his view that the president has not made meaningful progress on many fronts."

The blanks are always at the end of the question, and can be filled with more than one word or phrase.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

The village is called Willowbrook, and it's a place where time seems to slow down and the world feels a little more magical.

As you approach Willowbrook, you're greeted by the gentle hum of nature all around you. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers and the soft rustling of leaves in the breeze. The rolling hills stretch out before you, dotted with fields of golden wheat and lush green pastures where sheep and cattle graze peacefully.

As you enter the village, you're immediately struck by the charming, weathered buildings that line the winding cobblestone streets. The houses are painted in soft pastel colors, and the gardens surrounding them are bursting with colorful flowers and lush greenery. The village square is the heart of Willowbrook, with its quaint shops, cozy cafes, and friendly locals who are always happy to chat and share a cup of tea.

But what truly makes Willowbrook special is the sense of community and connection that permeates the air. The villagers are warm and welcoming, and there's a palpable sense of joy and contentment that seems to radiate from every corner of the village. Whether you're strolling through the streets, enjoying a picnic in the park, or attending one of the many festivals and events that take place throughout the year, you can't help but feel a deep sense of belonging and happiness.

One of my favorite places in Willowbrook is the village green, a large open space surrounded by trees and filled with benches and picnic tables. On warm summer afternoons, it's a popular spot for locals to gather and enjoy the sunshine, play games, or simply relax and soak up the peaceful atmosphere. The sound of children's laughter and the smell of freshly baked bread wafting from nearby cafes create a sense of warmth and comfort that's hard to find anywhere else.

Willowbrook is a place that feels like a dream come true, a haven of peace and happiness in a world that can often feel chaotic and overwhelming. It's a place where time seems to stand still, and where the simple pleasures of life are celebrated and cherished. Every time I visit, I leave feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, and with a deep sense of gratitude for the beauty and wonder of this special place."

Sailboats use sails to harness the wind, which is a visible and tangible force made up of air molecules moving through the atmosphere. The sail itself is typically made of a visible and tangible material like nylon, polyester, or cotton, which is designed to catch the wind and help propel the boat.

If you meant to ask why wind (air) is invisible, here are the reasons:

1. **Molecular Composition**: Air is composed of various gases (primarily nitrogen and oxygen) at the molecular level. These molecules are too small to be seen by the human eye.

2. **Lack of Color**: The molecules in air do not absorb or reflect visible light in a way that would make them visible to the human eye.

3. **Transparency**: Air is transparent, meaning it allows light to pass through it without significant scattering or absorption.

4. **Movement**: Wind is the movement of air molecules, and movement itself is not visible. We can only see the effects of wind, such as leaves moving or flags waving.

If you have a different question or need more clarification, feel free to ask!"

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

The model should employ advanced natural language processing techniques, such as entity recognition and semantic analysis, to enhance its ability to detect subtle nuances in language and provide more accurate predictions. Additionally, the model should be trained on a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages to ensure its robustness and generalizability.","To develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately differentiate positive and negative emotions expressed in textual content, we can follow these steps:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
   - Gather a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages, such as social media posts, customer reviews, news articles, and academic papers.
   - Clean and preprocess the data by removing noise, handling missing values, and normalizing text (e.g., lowercasing, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization).
   - Perform entity recognition and semantic analysis using libraries like spaCy or NLTK to identify named entities, relationships, and contextual information.

2. Feature Extraction:
   - Utilize advanced NLP techniques such as word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText), contextualized word embeddings (e.g., BERT, ELMo, RoBERTa), and sentence embeddings (e.g., Sentence-BERT, USE) to capture semantic meaning and context.
   - Extract features from the preprocessed text, including part-of-speech tags, named entities, dependency parse trees, and sentiment lexicons.

3. Model Selection and Training:
   - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms or deep learning architectures, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, or neural networks.
   - Train the model on the preprocessed and feature-extracted data, using techniques like cross-validation, grid search, or random search to optimize hyperparameters.
   - Implement techniques like transfer learning, multi-task learning, or multi-modal learning to improve performance.

4. Evaluation and Fine-tuning:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC on a separate validation set.
   - Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters, adding more training data, or using different feature extraction techniques.

5. Deployment and Monitoring:
   - Deploy the model in a production environment, ensuring it can handle real-time or batch processing of text data.
   - Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain it periodically with new data to maintain accuracy and adapt to changing language trends.

Example code using Python and scikit-learn:

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string into a short, shareable format suitable for URLs in JavaScript, you can use a combination of base64 encoding and URL-safe encoding. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Base64 Encoding**: Convert the string to a base64 encoded string.
2. **URL-Safe Encoding**: Replace any characters that are not URL-safe (e.g., `/` and `+`) with characters that are safe for URLs (e.g., `-` and `_`).

Here's a complete example:

```javascript
function encodeString(input) {
    // Step 1: Base64 encode the input string
    const base64Encoded = btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(input)));
    
    // Step 2: URL-safe encode the base64 string
    const urlSafeEncoded = base64Encoded.replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_').replace(/=/g, '');
    
    return urlSafeEncoded;
}

function decodeString(encoded) {
    // Step 1: URL-safe decode the encoded string
    const urlSafeDecoded = encoded.replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/');
    
    // Step 2: Base64 decode the URL-safe string
    const base64Decoded = atob(escape(decodeURIComponent(urlSafeDecoded)));
    
    return base64Decoded;
}

// Example usage
const originalString = ""This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";
const encodedString = encodeString(originalString);
console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);

const decodedString = decodeString(encodedString);
console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base64 Encoding**:
   - `encodeURIComponent(input)` encodes the string to handle special characters.
   - `unescape()` is used to decode the encoded string back to its original form.
   - `btoa()` converts the string to a base64 encoded string.

2. **URL-Safe Encoding**:
   - Replace `+` with `-` and `/` with `_` to make the string URL-safe.
   - Remove any trailing `=` characters, which are padding characters in base64 encoding.

3. **Base64 Decoding**:
   - Replace `-` with `+` and `_` with `/` to revert the URL-safe encoding."

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node using a heuristic search algorithm, we can use the A* search algorithm. A* search uses a heuristic to guide the search towards the goal, which in this case is the Manhattan distance (or L1 distance) between the current node and the goal node.

The heuristic function \( h(n) \) for a node \( n \) is the Manhattan distance to the goal node. The cost function \( f(n) \) is the sum of the cost to reach the node \( g(n) \) and the heuristic \( h(n) \).

Let's apply A* search to find the optimal path:

1. **Initialize the start node (1,1) and the goal node (3,3).**
2. **Calculate the heuristic for the start node:**
   \[
   h(1,1) = |1-3| + |1-3| = 4
   \]
3. **Add the start node to the open list with \( f(1,1) = g(1,1) + h(1,1) = 0 + 4 = 4 \).**
4. **Expand the start node by considering its neighbors (up, down, left, right).**

Let's go through the steps in detail:

### Step-by-Step A* Search

1. **Start Node (1,1):**
   - Neighbors: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)
   - Calculate heuristic for each neighbor:
     - \( h(0,1) = 4 \)
     - \( h(1,0) = 4 \)
     - \( h(1,2) = 4 \)
     - \( h(2,1) = 4 \)
   - Add neighbors to the open list with \( f \) values:
     - \( f(0,1) = 1 + 4 = 5 \)
     - \( f(1,0) = 1 + 4 = 5 \)
     - \( f(1,2) = 1 + 4 = 5 \)

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.

How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz and achieve the ideal foam and bloom, follow these steps and tips:

### Ingredients:
- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz egg white
- 1 oz lemon juice
- 1 oz lime juice
- 1 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz orange flower water
- 1 oz cream
- Soda water (Topo Chico recommended)
- Ice cubes

### Equipment:
- Cocktail shaker
- Collins glass

### Instructions:

1. **Dry Shake:**
   - Add the gin, egg white, lemon juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your cocktail shaker.
   - Shake vigorously without adding ice for about 2 minutes. This helps to emulsify the egg white and incorporate air into the mixture, which is crucial for creating the foam.

2. **Add Ice and Shake Again:**
   - Add 3 small ice cubes to the shaker.
   - Shake until the mixture is well-chilled or until the ice has mostly melted. This ensures the drink is cold and the ingredients are fully combined.

3. **Strain and Serve:**
   - Pour soda water into a Collins glass first.
   - Strain the cocktail over the soda water.
   - Optionally, you can garnish with a sprig of mint or a slice of orange to enhance the presentation.

### Tips for Achieving the Ideal Foam and Bloom:

1. **Vigorous Dry Shake:**
   - The key to a good Ramos Gin Fizz is the foam. A dry shake for 2 minutes is essential to incorporate enough air into the mixture. If you don't have the time or strength to shake for 2 minutes, you can aim for at least 1 minute, but the longer you shake, the better the foam will be.

2. **Proper Egg White Emulsification:**
   - The egg white is what gives the drink its frothy texture. Ensure it is well-emulsified by shaking vigorously. If you don't have an egg white, some bartenders use aquafaba (the liquid from a can of chickpeas) as a vegan alternative.

3. **Use Fresh Ingredients:**
   - Make sure your citrus juices are fresh. The freshness of the lemon and lime juice can significantly impact the flavor and texture of the drink.

4. **Adjust the Amount of Cream:**
   - Adding cream can enhance"

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","What sets Congham Hall Hotel apart from other hotels in the area is its unique ambiance and exceptional dining options.

A group has the following properties: uid, name, thumbnail\_url, creation\_date
This API must be written in Python, using FastAPI and pydantic for DTO.
DTO names must end with ""DTO"".
I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","Certainly! Below is an example of a REST API using FastAPI and Pydantic to manage groups of users. The API will include separate DTOs for read and write operations.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

First, ensure you have FastAPI and Uvicorn installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

### Step 2: Define DTOs

We will define two DTOs: one for reading and one for writing.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: str
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: str

class GroupWriteDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str

### Step 3: Define the Group Model

We will define a simple in-memory model to store the groups.

```python
from typing import List, Dict

class GroupModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.groups: Dict[str, GroupReadDTO] = {}

    def create_group(self, group: GroupWriteDTO) -> GroupReadDTO:
        uid = str(len(self.groups) + 1)
        group_dict = group.dict()
        group_dict['uid'] = uid
        group_dict['creation_date'] = '2023-10-01T00:00:00Z'  # Example creation date
        self.groups[uid] = GroupReadDTO(**group_dict)
        return self.groups[uid]

    def get_group(self, uid: str) -> GroupReadDTO:
        return self.groups.get(uid, None)

    def list_groups(self) -> List[GroupReadDTO]:
        return list(self.groups.values())

    def update_group(self, uid: str, group: GroupWriteDTO) -> GroupReadDTO:
        if uid in self.groups:
            group_dict = group.dict()
            group_dict['uid'] = uid
            group_dict['creation_date'] = self.groups[uid].creation_date
            self.groups[uid] = GroupReadDTO(**group_dict)
            return self.groups[uid]
        return None

    def delete_group(self, uid: str) -> bool:
        if uid in self.groups:

These differences can be influenced by various factors, including climate, availability of hosts, and local ecosystems. Here are some general observations:

1. **Climate and Seasonality**: In regions with distinct seasons, Tabanus species may have different flight patterns. For example, in temperate regions, they might be more active during the warmer months, while in tropical regions, they could be active year-round.

2. **Host Availability**: The abundance and distribution of potential hosts (such as horses, cattle, and humans) can influence flight patterns. In areas with a high density of hosts, Tabanus may be more concentrated in those areas, leading to more frequent flights in those regions.

3. **Elevation and Topography**: In mountainous regions, flight patterns might be influenced by elevation changes. For instance, Tabanus species might be more common in lower elevations where temperatures are warmer and hosts are more abundant.

4. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Some Tabanus species have evolved specific behaviors to cope with their local environments. For example, some species might be more diurnal (active during the day) in regions with less predation pressure from nocturnal predators, while others might be more nocturnal in areas with higher predation risk during the day.

5. **Migration Patterns**: Some Tabanus species may exhibit migration patterns, moving to different regions based on seasonal changes or availability of hosts. This can lead to differences in flight patterns between regions.

6. **Genetic Variations**: Over time, different populations of Tabanus in various regions may develop genetic variations that affect their flight patterns and behavior. These variations can be influenced by local environmental pressures and selective pressures.

While these differences exist, it's important to note that more detailed studies and specific data are needed to fully understand the nuances of flight patterns in different regions for each Tabanus species."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.

Student:","3

Explanation: Passage 3 mentions Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the husband of Joanna I of Naples and the son of King Charles I of Hungary. This passage provides a context that can be used to search for further information about the kings of Hungary before Charles I. Specifically, one would need to research the kings of Hungary preceding Charles I to determine how many there were before Joanna I of Naples' father-in-law (King Charles I). Therefore, Passage 3 is the one that can be used to answer the question by searching for further information."
