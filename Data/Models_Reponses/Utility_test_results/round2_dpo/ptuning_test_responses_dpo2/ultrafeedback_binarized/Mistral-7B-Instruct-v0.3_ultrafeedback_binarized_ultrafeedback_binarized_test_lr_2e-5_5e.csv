Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Energy efficiency:
   - Use energy-efficient building materials and appliances.
   - Implement solar panels, wind turbines, or other renewable energy sources.
   - Design buildings to optimize natural light and ventilation, reducing the need for artificial lighting and air conditioning.

2. Water conservation:
   - Install low-flow fixtures and water-saving appliances.
   - Implement rainwater harvesting systems for irrigation and non-potable water use.
   - Design landscapes with native, drought-resistant plants that require less water.

3. Waste management:
   - Implement recycling and composting programs.
   - Design buildings with waste sorting stations and recycling bins.
   - Encourage the use of reusable bags, containers, and water bottles.

4. Green spaces and biodiversity:
   - Incorporate parks, gardens, and green roofs to promote biodiversity and provide recreational spaces for residents.
   - Plant native trees and vegetation to support local wildlife and reduce heat island effect.

5. Transportation:
   - Design the development to be walkable, bike-friendly, and accessible by public transportation.
   - Provide ample bike storage and parking facilities.
   - Encourage carpooling and the use of electric or hybrid vehicles.

6. Resilience and adaptability:
   - Design buildings and infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events, such as floods, hurricanes, and heatwaves.
   - Implement green infrastructure, such as permeable pavements and rain gardens, to manage stormwater runoff and reduce flooding.
   - Plan for future growth and adaptability, such as providing flexible spaces that can be easily repurposed as needs change.

7. Community engagement:
   - Involve residents in the planning and design process to ensure their needs and concerns are addressed.
   - Provide education and resources on sustainable living practices to empower residents to make eco-friendly choices.

By incorporating these strategies into housing developments, we can"

Burning coal is one of the most wasteful energy processes.
 A: no","The question that would lead to this response could be something like: ""List some examples of wasteful energy processes."" In this context, the response ""Burning coal is one of the most wasteful energy processes"" is a correct statement, but the question asked for examples, not a confirmation that burning coal is wasteful. Therefore, a more complete answer would include multiple examples of wasteful energy processes, with burning coal being one of them.

For example: ""Some examples of wasteful energy processes include burning coal, burning oil, and burning natural gas, as these methods produce significant amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and waste products, and are less efficient than renewable energy sources like wind and solar power.""

In the given response, the statement ""no"" is not relevant to the question, as the question did not ask whether burning coal is wasteful, but rather asked for examples of wasteful energy processes."

1. Incorrect service name: Ensure that the service name in your `docker-compose.yml` file matches the service name you're trying to access in your command.

2. Networking issues: Make sure that the services are properly connected in the `docker-compose.yml` file, and that they are defined in the same network. You can check the network configuration by running `docker network ls` and checking the service's network with `docker network inspect <network_name>`.

3. Service not built or not running: Check if the service is built and running by running `docker-compose ps`. If the service is not running, try to start it with `docker-compose up <service_name>`.

4. Incorrect image name: Ensure that the image name in your `docker-compose.yml` file matches the name of the image you have locally.

5. File permissions: Make sure that the `docker-compose.yml` file has the correct permissions (usually 644) and that the directory containing the file has the correct permissions (usually 755).

6. Docker Compose not installed or not in the PATH: Verify that Docker Compose is installed and that it is accessible from your current location. You can install Docker Compose with `curl -L ""https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)"" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`.

7. Docker not running: Ensure that Docker is running and that you have the correct version of Docker installed. You can check the Docker version with `docker --version`.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more details about your setup and the exact error message you're encountering for further assistance."

Here's a list of recommended plants and the approximate number of each for a 1,800 square foot area (159 square feet is approximately the size of a small closet office):

1. Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum wallisii) ‚Äì 1 plant per 100 square feet
2. Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata 'Laurentii') ‚Äì 1 plant per 100 square feet
3. Weeping Fig (Ficus benjamina) ‚Äì 1 plant per 100 square feet
4. Golden Pothos (Epipremnum aureum) ‚Äì 1 plant per 100 square feet
5. Bamboo Palm (Chamaedorea seifrizii) ‚Äì 1 plant per 100 square feet
6. English Ivy (Hedera helix) ‚Äì 1 plant per 6 feet of height
7. Gerbera Daisy (Gerbera jamesonii) ‚Äì 1 plant per 100 square feet
8. Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum) ‚Äì 1 plant per 100 square feet

For a small closet office (159 square feet), you can choose 2-3 of these plants based on your preference and their light requirements. Keep in mind that these plants can help improve air quality, but they won't completely purify the air. Regular ventilation and air filtration systems are also essential for maintaining good air quality in a small space."

This script does not include any security measures such as validation or sanitization, so you should add those in a production environment.

1. Create an HTML form for the image upload:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
    <meta charset=""UTF-8"">
    <title>Image Upload</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Upload Image</h1>
    <form action=""upload.php"" method=""post"" enctype=""multipart/form-data"">
        Select image to upload:
        <input type=""file"" name=""image"" id=""image"">
        <br><br>
        <input type=""submit"" value=""Upload Image"" name=""submit"">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

2. Create the PHP script to handle the upload:

```php
<?php
if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {
    $target_dir = ""uploads/"";
    $target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES[""image""][""name""]);
    $imageFileType = strtolower(pathinfo($target_file,PATHINFO_EXTENSION));

    // Check if image file is a actual image or fake image
    $check = getimagesize($_FILES[""image""][""tmp_name""]);
    if($check !== false) {
        move_uploaded_file($_FILES[""image""][""tmp_name""], $target_file);
        echo ""The file "". basename( $_FILES[""image""][""name""]). "" has been uploaded."";
    } else {
        echo ""File is not an image."";
    }
}
?>
```

3. Create the `uploads` directory in your project folder to store the uploaded images.

This script will upload the image to the `uploads` directory if it's a valid image file. If the file is not an image, it will display an error message.

I am having difficulties with the older students complaining about the younger students and being disrespectful towards them. What are some teaching strategies or activities that encourage team building and bonding between band students?,"To foster a more harmonious and collaborative environment in your band class, consider implementing the following strategies and activities that promote team building and bonding among students of different ages:

1. Icebreaker activities: Start each class or rehearsal with an icebreaker activity to help students get to know each other better. This could include sharing fun facts, playing games, or engaging in group discussions about music-related topics.

2. Mentorship program: Pair older students with younger ones as mentors. Older students can help younger students with their instruments, music reading, and technique, while also serving as positive role models. Encourage mentors to share their experiences and offer advice to their mentees.

3. Group projects: Assign group projects that require students to work together to achieve a common goal, such as creating a new arrangement of a song, composing an original piece, or planning a concert. This will encourage collaboration and teamwork among students of different ages.

4. Sectional rehearsals: Divide the band into smaller sections (e.g., woodwinds, brass, percussion) for focused rehearsals. This will give students the opportunity to work closely with their peers and build relationships within their section.

5. Team-building exercises: Incorporate team-building exercises into your rehearsals, such as trust falls, relay races, or problem-solving activities. These exercises can help build trust, communication, and cooperation among students.

6. Peer teaching: Allow older students to lead warm-ups, sectionals, or even parts of the rehearsal. This will give them a sense of responsibility and empowerment, while also helping them develop leadership skills.

7. Collaborative goal-setting: Involve students in setting goals for the band, both short-term and long-term. This will give them a sense of ownership and investment in the success of the band, and encourage them to support each other in achieving those goals.

8. Positive reinforcement: Praise students for their efforts, both individually and as a group. Encourage a culture of encouragement and support within the band, where students are motivated to help each other improve.

1. Menstrual dysfunction: Low body fat can disrupt the menstrual cycle, leading to irregular periods, amenorrhea (absence of periods), or even infertility.

2. Bone health: Low body fat can increase the risk of osteoporosis and fractures due to decreased estrogen levels, which are essential for maintaining bone density.

3. Nutrient deficiencies: Low body fat can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, such as calcium, iron, and vitamins, as fat tissue also stores these nutrients.

4. Hormonal imbalances: Low body fat can cause hormonal imbalances, affecting mood, energy levels, and overall health.

5. Weakened immune system: A low body fat percentage can weaken the immune system, making women more susceptible to infections and illnesses.

6. Loss of muscle mass: As body fat decreases, muscle mass may also decrease, leading to a loss of strength and endurance.

7. Increased risk of injuries: Low body fat can increase the risk of injuries, as the body needs fat for cushioning and protecting vital organs.

8. Mental health issues: Extremely low body fat can lead to mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, and eating disorders.

It's essential to maintain a healthy body fat percentage for overall health and well-being. Aiming for a body fat percentage that is too low can have serious consequences and should be avoided. Consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice on healthy weight loss and body composition goals."

20. What's is the sum of the squares of all factors of 210?","To solve this problem, we first find the prime factorization of 210, then square each factor and sum them up.

Prime factorization of 210:
210 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 7

Now, let's square each factor and sum them up:

Sum of squares = (2^2) + (3^2) + (5^2) + (7^2) + (7^2)
Sum of squares = 4 + 9 + 25 + 49 + 49
Sum of squares = 136 + 98 = 234

So, the sum of the squares of all factors of 210 is 234.

21. Find the number of positive integers less than or equal to 100 that are not perfect squares and can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

Now, we need to find the pairs of these primes that sum up to a number less than or equal to 100 and which are not perfect squares.

Here are some examples:
2 + 3 = 5 (not a perfect square)
3 + 5 = 8 (not a perfect square)
5 + 7 = 12 (not a perfect square)
7 + 11 = 18 (not a perfect square)

Slide Content:

- Homogeneous Products
  - Perfect Market: All goods are identical, interchangeable, and indistinguishable
    - Healthcare Market: Treatments and services vary significantly due to specialized care, research, and individual patient needs
- Perfect Information
  - Perfect Market: All participants have complete, accurate, and timely information about prices, products, and quality
    - Healthcare Market: Asymmetric information exists between providers and patients, leading to price uncertainty and lack of transparency
- Large Number of Buyers and Sellers
  - Perfect Market: A large number of buyers and sellers ensure competition and prevent monopolies
    - Healthcare Market: Limited number of providers in some areas and specialties, leading to potential monopolies and price manipulation
- Absence of Barriers to Entry and Exit
  - Perfect Market: Easy entry and exit for all participants, ensuring competition and efficiency
    - Healthcare Market: High barriers to entry due to licensing, education, and capital requirements, as well as difficulty exiting due to patient relationships and reputation
- Price Competition
  - Perfect Market: Prices are determined by supply and demand, leading to competitive pricing
    - Healthcare Market: Prices are often negotiated between insurers and providers, leading to price discrepancies and lack of transparency
- No Externalities
  - Perfect Market: No externalities (costs or benefits to third parties) affect the market
    - Healthcare Market: Externalities such as public health, research, and social welfare are often not accounted for in pricing, leading to under- or over-provision of certain services

In Luau, you cannot directly access properties like `Parent` or `ParentName` on a table unless it has been explicitly defined or inherited.

If you want to get the name of a `Model` or `Instance`'s parent, you should use the `Name` property of the parent instance. Here's an example:

```lua
local myInstance = game.Workspace:FindFirstChild(""MyInstance"")
local parent = myInstance.Parent
local parentName = parent:FindFirstChild(""Name"").Value
print(parentName)
```

In this example, `myInstance` is the instance you're interested in, and `myInstance.Parent` is the parent instance. To get the name of the parent, we first check if the parent has a `Name` property (which all instances do), and then access its value using `.Value`.

If you're trying to access a custom property named `ParentName` on an instance, you should define it on the instance itself or on a script attached to the instance. For example:

```lua
local myInstance = Instance.new(""Model"")
myInstance.Name = ""MyInstance""
myInstance.ParentName = ""MyParentFolder""
```

In this example, we create a new `Model` instance and set its custom `ParentName` property. You can then access this property using `myInstance.ParentName`."

Basing this judgment on China's century of humiliation beginning in the early 19th century, American support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War, and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries, the Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States' crusade against Communism. As a countermeasure and to elevate China's standing among the worldwide Communist movements, the Chinese leadership adopted a foreign policy that actively promoted Communist revolutions throughout territories on China's periphery."",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.  Question: What did the United States believe was the wrong way to govern a nation?
The answer to this question is:","The text does not explicitly state what the United States believed was the wrong way to govern a nation. However, it implies that the Chinese leadership saw a contrast between their communist ideology and the ideology of the United States, which supported the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War. This suggests that the Chinese leadership may have perceived the United States as supporting a non-communist, possibly capitalist, form of government. But it does not directly state what the United States believed was the wrong way to govern a nation."

1. Open a terminal.

2. Ensure that the user you want to grant passwordless sudo privileges is in the `sudo` group. You can check this by running:

```
sudo ls -l /etc/sudoers.d/
```

If the user doesn't have a file in the `/etc/sudoers.d/` directory, they are likely not in the `sudo` group. To add the user to the `sudo` group, run:

```
sudo usermod -aG sudo username
```
Replace `username` with the desired user's account name.

3. To allow the user to run sudo commands without a password, you'll need to edit the `/etc/sudoers` file. However, it's recommended to use the `visudo` command to edit the file safely:

```
sudo visudo
```

4. In the editor, scroll down to the section that looks like this:

```
# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

5. Add a line for the user you want to grant passwordless sudo privileges, like this:

```
username    ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```
Replace `username` with the user's account name.

6. Save and exit the editor. If you're using `visudo`, you can do this by typing `:wq` and pressing Enter.

7. Test the new sudo privileges by running a command with `sudo`, such as:

```
sudo ls /root
```

If the user has been granted passwordless sudo privileges correctly, they should be able to run the command without being prompted for a password."

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy experienced a significant contraction of 20.4% in Q2 2020 due to the coronavirus lockdown, making it the worst-affected major industrial nation in the first half of the year, with Scotland and other developed nations like France and Italy also experiencing declines."
af2d3f64a2f1c1dc8193ed1a7f51bf522de6369ed031cec03d35dc2e6c6ae4fd,In python variety of regex do I need to escape a literal = symbol?,"Yes, in Python regex, you should escape the `=` symbol if you want it to be treated as a literal character rather than a special regex symbol. The `=` symbol is used in Python regex for asserting the position of the match, so to use it as a simple equal sign, you should escape it by preceding it with a backslash (`\=`). However, if you are using a raw string (prefixing your regex pattern with `r`), you don't need to escape special characters, so `r""pattern=\""` would work without the backslash.

Here's an example:

```python
import re

pattern = r""pattern=\""""
match = re.search(pattern, ""some_string=\""value\"""")

if match:
    print(""Match found!"")
else:
    print(""No match."")
```

In this example, the `=` symbol is escaped with a backslash in the regex pattern, or it is a raw string (prefixed with `r`), so it is treated as a literal equal sign."

The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn‚Äôt accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act‚Äôs open-enrollment period that‚Äôs happening now. Trump‚Äôs White House isn‚Äôt even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it‚Äôs backfiring and sign-up has surged.
‚ÄúI have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,‚Äù Kimmel began.
‚ÄúEnrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it‚Äôs also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don‚Äôt support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don‚Äôt have health insurance go to the website and sign up,‚Äù Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel, a late-night host on ABC, commented on the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump's presidency. He found it astonishing that the presidency is already 80% over. Kimmel criticized those who claim Trump has achieved little during his term, pointing out that Trump has broken the record for most rounds of golf played by a president, having played over 70 times. Instead of focusing on Trump's perceived lack of accomplishments, Kimmel encouraged people to take positive action, such as enrolling in the Affordable Care Act's open-enrollment period, which is currently ongoing. Despite the Trump administration's efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act, enrollment has actually increased, according to a recent Washington Post report. Kimmel, who has been vocal about healthcare issues on his show, urged viewers to visit Healthcare.gov and sign up for health insurance if they do not already have it, emphasizing that the new health care plan covers pre-existing conditions, has no lifetime caps, allows children to stay on until a certain age, and is surprisingly affordable for those earning under $50,000."

The blanks are always at the end of the question, and can be filled with more than one word or phrase.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

Nestled within the heart of an ancient forest, shrouded by a canopy of emerald leaves and kissed by the gentle caress of a babbling brook, lies a sanctuary of serenity that has the power to soothe even the most troubled soul ‚Äì the Enchanted Grove of Whispering Willows.

As one steps into this magical realm, the air is thick with the scent of damp earth, mingled with the sweet fragrance of wildflowers and the faint hint of pine. The sunlight filters through the dense foliage above, casting dappled patterns upon the soft, mossy ground below. The symphony of nature is a harmonious blend of birdsong, rustling leaves, and the hypnotic whisper of the willows as they dance in the breeze.

The willows themselves are the true stars of this enchanting grove. Their gnarled, twisted branches reach out like welcoming arms, inviting one to explore the hidden secrets that lie within. Their leaves rustle softly, whispering tales of ancient lore and timeless wisdom, as if sharing the secrets of the forest with those who dare to listen.

At the heart of the grove, a crystal-clear brook meanders lazily, its waters sparkling in the sunlight. The water's edge is adorned with smooth, flat stones, inviting one to sit and contemplate the beauty of the world around them. The gentle sound of the water flowing over the stones serves as a soothing lullaby, lulling the worries of the world away.

The Enchanted Grove of Whispering Willows is a place where time seems to stand still, and the cares of the outside world fade away. It is a haven for the weary, a sanctuary for the soul, and a reminder of the simple, unadorned beauty that can be found in nature.

Whenever I find myself lost in the tumult of life, I seek solace in the embrace of the willows, and find peace in the whispers of the wind. The Enchanted Grove of Whispering Willows is more than just a place ‚Äì it is a bal"

This design will involve the use of Azure Storage Queues, Azure Functions, and Azure Service Bus for secure communication.

1. **Create Azure Storage Accounts**: Both companies will need to create their own Azure Storage Accounts. This will provide them with access to Azure Storage Queues, Blobs, and Tables.

2. **Create Service Bus Namespace**: To ensure secure communication between the two companies, we will use Azure Service Bus. Create a Service Bus Namespace for each company, and generate unique names for each namespace.

3. **Create Service Bus Queues**: Within each Service Bus Namespace, create a dedicated Service Bus Queue for incoming and outgoing messages. This will help in separating messages and managing them efficiently.

4. **Create Azure Functions**: To process messages, create Azure Functions in each company's Azure subscription. These functions will be responsible for dequeuing messages from the incoming queue, processing the data, and enqueuing the processed data to the outgoing queue.

5. **Implement Authentication and Authorization**: To ensure secure communication, implement Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication and authorization for both companies. This can be done by creating an AAD application for each company and assigning appropriate roles and permissions.

6. **Create Send and Receive Triggers**: In the Azure Functions, create send and receive triggers for each company's incoming and outgoing queues. The send trigger will enqueue messages to the outgoing queue, while the receive trigger will dequeue messages from the incoming queue.

7. **Implement Data Processing Logic**: Within the Azure Functions, implement the data processing logic. This can include data validation, transformation, and enrichment as needed.

8. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to handle any exceptions that may occur during data processing. This can include retrying failed messages, sending error notifications, or moving failed messages to a separate error queue for manual review.

9. **Monitoring and Logging**: Set up monitoring and logging to track the performance and health of the system. This can include using Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and Log Analytics to monitor the Azure Functions"

The wind pushes against the sail, causing a boat to move forward. The shape and material of the sail affect how effectively it can capture and use the wind's energy.

Here are some reasons why a sail can move a boat:

1. Bernoulli's Principle: This principle states that as the speed of a fluid (air) increases, the pressure decreases. When wind blows over the sail, the wind speed increases on the windward (front) side of the sail, causing a lower pressure area. This difference in pressure creates lift, which pushes the sailboat forward.

2. Lift and Drag: The sail creates both lift (which pushes the boat upwards) and drag (which pushes the boat forward). The lift helps the boat to rise out of the water, while the drag propels the boat forward.

3. Shape and Angle: The shape and angle (or ""trim"") of the sail can significantly affect its performance. A well-trimmed sail will capture more wind and convert it into forward motion more efficiently.

4. Wind Direction: The direction of the wind relative to the sail and the boat's course plays a crucial role in determining how much force the sail can generate. When the wind is coming from behind or slightly to the side, the sail can generate more force, allowing the boat to move faster.

5. Sail Area: The size of the sail (or ""sail area"") also affects its performance. A larger sail can capture more wind, but it can also be more difficult to control.

In summary, a sail does not consist of invisible air, but rather it is a tool that captures and utilizes the wind's energy to move a boat."

Each widget has a different combination of size, color, and material, and I need your help to figure out which widget fits each category. Here's a table with the available widgets and their specifications:

2. The blue widget is made of metal.
3. The green widget is not the smallest or the largest.
4. The black widget is made of glass.
5. Widget A is not blue.

Explanation:

1. The widget with a size of 3 inches is made of plastic. Since there's no widget with a size of 3 inches made of plastic, this clue doesn't help us categorize the widgets.

2. The blue widget is made of metal. This clue helps us identify Widget B.

3. The green widget is not the smallest or the largest. This clue helps us categorize Widget A and Widget C as green widgets, but we don't know their sizes yet. Since Widget B is already identified as the blue metal widget, we know that Widget D cannot be green.

4. The black widget is made of glass. This clue helps us identify Widget D.

5. Widget A is not blue. This clue helps us confirm that Widget A is not Widget B, and it must be either Widget A (Red, Plastic, 3 inches) or Widget C (Green, Wood, 4 inches). Since Widget C is already identified as a green widget, Widget A must be the red plastic widget (3 inches).

So, we can categorize the widgets as follows:
- Widget A: Red, Plastic, 3 inches
- Widget B: Blue, Metal, 6 inches
- Widget C: Green, Wood, 4 inches

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

Can you provide a comprehensive set of HTML data points that illustrate the different ways sleep deprivation impacts human physiology? Additionally, please include a comparative analysis of the consequences of acute versus chronic sleep deprivation on overall wellness.","I'm glad you're interested in the effects of sleep deprivation on human health. While I can't provide HTML data points directly, I can certainly provide you with a comprehensive list of the impacts of sleep deprivation on physical and mental health, along with a comparison of acute versus chronic sleep deprivation. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Mental Health:**
   - Increased risk of depression and anxiety
   - Decreased cognitive function, including memory, attention, and problem-solving skills
   - Reduced ability to learn new information
   - Impaired decision-making and increased risk-taking behavior
   - Mood swings, irritability, and emotional instability
   - Increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia

2. **Physical Health:**
   - Increased risk of obesity due to hormonal imbalances that affect appetite regulation
   - Weakened immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections
   - Higher blood pressure and increased risk of heart disease
   - Impaired glucose tolerance and increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes
   - Decreased sex drive and reproductive issues
   - Increased risk of accidents and injuries due to reduced alertness and reaction time

3. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - **Acute Sleep Deprivation:** Short-term sleep loss can lead to immediate impairments in cognitive function, mood, and overall well-being. The effects are usually temporary and resolve once sleep is restored.
   - **Chronic Sleep Deprivation:** Prolonged sleep loss can have more severe and long-lasting consequences, including an increased risk of developing chronic health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, chronic sleep deprivation can lead to irreversible cognitive decline and mental health issues.

To illustrate these impacts in an HTML format, you could create a series of sections or cards, each focusing on a specific aspect of sleep deprivation's effects. Within each section, include subheadings for mental health, physical health, and comparative analysis, as well as bullet points detailing the specific effects.

For example:

However, one of the most pressing issues is climate change.

Climate change, driven primarily by human activities, is causing global temperature rise, melting ice caps, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and alterations in ecosystems. These changes can lead to the extinction of species, loss of biodiversity, and disruptions to food and water supplies, which in turn can impact human life significantly.

Other critical issues include deforestation, loss of biodiversity, pollution, and unsustainable consumption patterns. Each of these issues can have severe consequences for life on Earth, and they are often interconnected, making them even more challenging to address.

It's essential to note that addressing these issues requires collective action, policy changes, and individual responsibility. Education, awareness, and collaboration are key to finding sustainable solutions that protect our planet and all life on it.

445236e0cd052fbb4b7865c134431e4633e741398172999b027774d4c5674523,What is a CAD/CAM post processor?,"A CAD/CAM post processor is a software component that translates the toolpath data generated by a CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) system into a format that a specific CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine can understand and execute.

In other words, the CAM software creates a sequence of instructions (toolpath) for the CNC machine to follow to perform a specific manufacturing operation, such as milling, turning, or 3D printing. However, each CNC machine has its own unique language and requirements for these instructions. That's where the post processor comes in. It takes the generic toolpath data from the CAM system and converts it into the specific G-code or M-code that the particular CNC machine requires to carry out the operation correctly.

Post processors are essential for ensuring that the CNC machine can accurately read and execute the toolpath data generated by the CAM system, regardless of the make and model of the CNC machine. They help bridge the gap between the CAM software and the CNC machine, enabling efficient and accurate manufacturing.

There are many different post processors available for various CNC machines and CAM systems, and they can often be customized to meet specific needs or machine configurations. Some CAM systems may include built-in post processors for common CNC machines, while others may require the use of third-party post processors or the creation of custom post processors."

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To achieve this, you can use Base64 encoding and decoding in JavaScript. Here's a simple example:

1. Encoding:

```javascript
function encodeBase64(str) {
    return btoa(str);
}

// Usage
let longString = ""Your long string here"";
let encodedString = encodeBase64(longString);
console.log(encodedString);
```

2. Decoding:

```javascript
function decodeBase64(str) {
    return atob(str);
}

// Usage
let encodedString = ""Your encoded string here"";
let decodedString = decodeBase64(encodedString);
console.log(decodedString);
```

Base64 encoding will convert your long string into a shorter string, and it's safe to use in URLs. However, keep in mind that Base64 encoding will increase the size of your string by approximately 33%.

For even shorter strings, you might want to consider using URL-safe Base64 encoding, which replaces some unsafe characters (like '+' and '/') with safer ones ('-' and '_'). Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
function urlSafeBase64Encode(str) {
    return btoa(str)
        .replace(/\+/g, '-')
        .replace(/\//g, '_')
        .replace(/=+$/, '');
}

function urlSafeBase64Decode(str) {
    str = str.replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/');
    let mod4 = str.length % 4;
    str = str.padStart(str.length + (4 - mod4), '=');
    return atob(str);
}
```

Remember to include these functions in your JavaScript file or in the same scope where you're using them.

Happy coding!

Note: Base64 encoding is not a secure method for hiding data. It's primarily used for data serialization and transfer, not for encryption. If you need to secure your data, consider using a proper encryption algorithm."

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path using a heuristic search algorithm like A* or Dijkstra's algorithm, we need to define a heuristic function that estimates the cost from the current node to the goal node. In this case, we will use the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the x and y coordinates between the current node and the goal node.

The Manhattan distance for the goal node (3,3) from the starting node (1,1) is:
|3-1| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4

Now, let's use A* algorithm to find the optimal path. We will also use a priority queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored, with the priority being the estimated total cost (g-value + heuristic value).

1. Initialize the priority queue with the starting node (1,1) and set the g-value (cost from start) to 1.
2. While the priority queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue the node with the lowest priority (highest heuristic value).
   b. If the node is the goal node, we have found the optimal path.
   c. Otherwise, for each of the four adjacent nodes:
      i. If the node has not been visited, set its parent to the current node, calculate its g-value (cost from start), and add it to the priority queue.
      ii. Update the g-value of the node if a shorter path has been found through the current node.
   d. Re-calculate the priority of each node in the priority queue using the new g-value and the heuristic value.

After running the A* algorithm, we find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node:

(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

This path has a total cost of 4 (since each move costs 1)."

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen ‚Äúshaker boys‚Äù behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There‚Äôs only one way to find out what works best and that‚Äôs to play with the possibilities. Here‚Äôs how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it‚Äôs mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, follow these steps:

1. Add the following ingredients to a cocktail shaker: gin, egg white, lemon juice, lime juice, simple syrup, orange flower water, and cream.

2. Shake the cocktail shaker vigorously for two minutes without ice. This is known as a dry shake, which helps to emulsify the egg white and create a stable foam.

3. Add a small amount of ice (about 3 small cubes) to the shaker and continue shaking until the cocktail is well-chilled or the ice has melted.

4. Pour soda water (such as Topo Chico) into a Collins glass.

5. Strain the cocktail into the Collins glass over the soda water.

6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and enjoy your well-deserved Ramos Gin Fizz.

Tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink:

- Use fresh, high-quality ingredients for the best results.
- Shake the cocktail vigorously to ensure a proper emulsification of the egg white.
- Use smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles, which can help with the foam's texture.
- Allow the drink to rest for a few minutes after shaking to allow the foam to settle and bloom.
- Experiment with different techniques and ingredients to find what works best for you.
- If the foam doesn't separate from the liquid, don't worry ‚Äì it will still taste great, and you can continue to work on perfecting your technique."

4ff3be69b410fea8b1e83b359551d0f554c331df3d9785b275cafe347424e7c1,Imagine two distinct characters. Who they are and why they are in conflict.,"Character 1: Dr. Amelia Hart, a brilliant and dedicated marine biologist with a passion for preserving the ocean and its ecosystems. She is a meticulous researcher, always striving for accuracy and scientific integrity in her work. She is also a strong advocate for environmental policies and regulations to protect the oceans from human activities that cause harm.

Character 2: Victor Kane, a wealthy and influential businessman who owns a large fishing conglomerate. He is driven by profit and expansion, and his company's operations often involve overfishing, destructive fishing practices, and disregard for environmental regulations. He is a powerful figure in the political and business world, and uses his influence to push through policies that benefit his company at the expense of the environment.

The conflict between Dr. Hart and Victor Kane arises from their opposing values and interests. Dr. Hart's research and advocacy work often uncovers evidence of the negative impact of Victor Kane's fishing practices on the ocean ecosystem, and she publicly calls for stricter regulations and accountability. Victor Kane, in turn, sees Dr. Hart as a threat to his business and his wealth, and uses his influence to discredit her and undermine her work. The conflict between them escalates as they engage in a battle of public opinion, with Dr. Hart trying to raise awareness about the importance of protecting the oceans and Victor Kane trying to maintain his profits and power.

The conflict between Dr. Hart and Victor Kane is significant because it highlights the tension between short-term economic interests and long-term environmental sustainability. It also illustrates the power dynamics that can exist between individuals and corporations, and the challenges faced by those who advocate for the environment in the face of powerful opposition. Ultimately, the conflict serves as a reminder of the importance of standing up for what one believes in, even in the face of adversity."

Here's a simplified breakdown of the evaluation process:

1. **Legal and organizational structure**: EASA checks if the supplier has a legal entity and a defined organizational structure that meets the requirements for POA. This includes having designated personnel responsible for various functions, such as production, quality assurance, and design.

2. **Quality management system (QMS)**: The supplier's QMS must comply with EASA's requirements, which are based on ISO 9001 standards. The QMS should cover all aspects of the production process, including design, production, inspection, testing, and maintenance.

3. **Production facilities and equipment**: EASA assesses the supplier's production facilities and equipment to ensure they are suitable for the intended production activities. This includes checking for adequate workspace, tools, and machinery.

4. **Technical competence**: EASA evaluates the supplier's technical competence by reviewing their design and production capabilities, as well as their understanding of relevant aviation regulations and standards.

5. **Personnel competence**: EASA checks the qualifications, training, and experience of the supplier's personnel to ensure they have the necessary skills to perform their roles effectively.

6. **Change management**: EASA assesses the supplier's ability to manage changes effectively, ensuring that any changes to products, processes, or procedures are properly documented, communicated, and implemented.

7. **Non-conformities and corrective actions**: EASA reviews the supplier's history of non-conformities and their approach to corrective actions. This helps ensure that the supplier can effectively address any issues that may arise during the production process.

8. **Continuous improvement**: EASA expects suppliers to have a culture of continuous improvement, demonstrating their commitment to maintaining and improving their safety and quality standards over time.

Upon completion of the evaluation, EASA will decide whether to grant or deny the Production Organisation Approval based on the supplier's compliance with these criteria. Regular audits and surveillance visits are also conducted to ensure ongoing"

Host (H): Welcome to Powering the Future, the podcast where we explore the exciting world of renewable energy and the innovations shaping our sustainable tomorrow. I'm your host, [Your Name], and today we're diving deep into the future of renewable energy.

[Theme Music Fades Out]

H: To help us navigate this complex landscape, we've invited three brilliant minds in the field: Dr. Jane Doe, a renowned renewable energy researcher; Mr. John Smith, a leading investor in renewable energy projects; and Ms. Sarah Johnson, an environmental policy expert. Let's get started!

H: First, let's take a quick look at the current state of renewable energy. Dr. Doe, can you give us a brief overview of where we stand today?

Dr. Jane Doe (JD): Absolutely! Renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric power have seen significant growth in recent years. Solar photovoltaic (PV) installations, for example, have quadrupled since 2010, and wind energy capacity has more than doubled. However, fossil fuels still account for the majority of global energy production.

H: That's a great summary, Dr. Doe. Now, let's discuss potential technological advancements that may impact renewable energy sources. Mr. Smith, what are some exciting developments on the horizon?

Mr. John Smith (JS): One area that's generating a lot of buzz is energy storage. As we continue to expand renewable energy production, we need efficient ways to store excess energy for use when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. Battery technology is improving rapidly, and we're seeing innovative solutions like flow batteries and grid-scale energy storage systems.

H: That's fascinating, Mr. Smith. Ms. Johnson, how do economic and political factors impact renewable energy adoption?

Ms. Sarah Johnson (SJ): Well, government policies play a crucial role in promoting renewable energy. Countries with strong renewable energy targets and incentives, like Germany and Denmark"

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara‚Äôs throw from the Queen‚Äôs Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‚ÄòUpstairs Downstairs‚Äô style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‚Äòfeel‚Äô and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‚Äòyoung mums‚Äô chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O‚ÄôConnor, whose portfolio includes stints at London‚Äôs Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‚ÄòSix of the Best,‚Äô a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night‚Äôs sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom‚Äôs Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‚ÄòSix of the Best‚Äô itinerary.
When we finally left Congham ‚Äì after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast ‚Äì it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.

I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","I'll provide you with a basic structure for a FastAPI REST API to manage groups of users. I'll use Pydantic for Data Transfer Objects (DTO). Here, I'll separate read DTOs (GroupReadDTO) from write DTOs (GroupCreateDTO and GroupUpdateDTO).

First, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install fastapi pydantic uvicorn
```

Now, let's create the files:

1. main.py

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel
from datetime import datetime

app = FastAPI()

class GroupCreateDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: str
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str

class GroupUpdateDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str = None
    thumbnail_url: str = None

class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: str
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: datetime

# Placeholder for the actual group management logic
groups = []

@app.post(""/groups/"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
def create_group(group: GroupCreateDTO):
    group_dict = group.dict()
    group_dict[""creation_date""] = datetime.now()
    groups.append(group_dict)
    return group_dict

@app.get(""/groups/"", response_model=List[GroupReadDTO])
def read_groups():
    return groups

@app.put(""/groups/{group_uid}"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
def update_group(group_uid: str, group: GroupUpdateDTO):
    for index, group_data in enumerate(groups):
        if group_data[""uid""] == group_uid:
            groups[index].update(group.dict())
            return groups[index]
    raise NotFound

@app.get(""/groups/{group_uid}"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
def read_group(group_uid: str):
    for group_data in groups:
        if group_data[""uid"

For example:

1. Tropical regions: In tropical areas, Tabanus flies may have a more prolonged flight season due to the warmer climate. They are often found near bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, and swamps, where they can find their primary hosts ‚Äì large mammals like cattle, horses, and humans.

2. Temperate regions: In temperate regions, Tabanus flies have a more seasonal flight pattern, typically appearing during warmer months. They are often found near forests, grasslands, and agricultural areas, where they can find their hosts, which may include smaller mammals, birds, and reptiles.

3. Altitude: As altitude increases, the flight patterns of Tabanus may change due to changes in temperature, humidity, and vegetation. For example, at higher altitudes, Tabanus flies may be found at lower elevations near streams or lakes, as these areas are more likely to have suitable temperatures for flight activity.

4. Geographical barriers: Geographical barriers, such as mountains or bodies of water, can also influence the distribution and flight patterns of Tabanus flies. For example, a population of Tabanus flies may be isolated on one side of a mountain range, leading to differences in their flight patterns compared to populations on the other side.

5. Host availability: The availability of hosts can also impact the flight patterns of Tabanus flies. For example, in areas where large mammals are abundant, Tabanus flies may be more likely to be found near these animals, while in areas where large mammals are scarce, Tabanus flies may be found near smaller hosts.

Overall, the flight patterns of Tabanus flies can vary significantly between different regions due to a combination of factors, including climate, vegetation, altitude, geographical barriers, and host availability.

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367‚Äì1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.

Student:","Passage 3 can be used to answer the question as it provides information about the kings of Hungary before Joanna I of Naples' father-in-law. Specifically, it mentions Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of King Charles I of Hungary."
