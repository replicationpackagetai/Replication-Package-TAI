When you encounter a 404 error while running `docker-compose up`, it could be due to several reasons. Here are some common causes and troubleshooting steps:

1. **Incorrect Service Name**:
   - Ensure that the service name you are trying to start exists in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     services:
       web:
         image: nginx
     ```

2. **Incorrect Command**:
   - Double-check the command you are using. The correct command is `docker-compose up` (without any service name unless you want to start a specific service).
   - Example:
     ```sh
     docker-compose up
     ```

3. **File Path**:
   - Ensure that the `docker-compose.yml` file is in the correct directory or provide the full path to the file.
   - Example:
     ```sh
     docker-compose -f /path/to/docker-compose.yml up
     ```

4. **Service Configuration**:
   - Check the configuration of the service in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Ensure that the service is properly defined and that there are no typos or syntax errors.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     services:
       web:
         image: nginx
         ports:
           - ""80:80""
     ```

5. **Network Issues**:
   - Ensure that the service is running and accessible. Sometimes, the service might not be running or might not be exposed correctly.
   - You can check the status of the service with:
     ```sh
     docker-compose ps
     ```

6. **Logs**:
   - Check the logs for more detailed information about what might be going wrong.
   - Example:
     ```sh
     docker-compose up --no-start
     docker-compose logs
     ```

7. **Dependencies**:
   - Ensure that all dependencies required by the service are properly configured and available.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     services:
       db:
         image: postgres
       web:
         image: nginx
         depends_on:
           - db
     ```

8. **Permissions**:
   - Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to run Docker commands.

9. **Docker Version**:
   - Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Docker and Docker Compose. Sometimes, issues"

The author's emotional state appears to be one of isolation and frustration. The use of the word ""ruined"" suggests a sense of loss or damage, while ""inaccessible"" implies a feeling of being cut off or unable to connect with others or the outside world. This metaphor of a ruined fortress could also symbolize a sense of defeat or abandonment, as if the author feels like a structure that has been left to decay. Overall, the imagery evokes a mood of desolation and a struggle against external forces that make it difficult to find a way out or connect with others."

Here are some guidelines to help you determine how many plants you need:

1. **Space Size**: Measure the square footage of your closet office. A general rule of thumb is to have one large plant or three small plants for every 100 square feet.

2. **Types of Plants**: Some plants are more effective at removing certain pollutants. Common air-purifying plants include:
   - **Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)**
   - **Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)**
   - **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)**
   - **Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica)**
   - **Boston Fern (Nephrolepis exaltata)**
   - **Areca Palm (Dypsis lutescens)**
   - **Dracaena (Dracaena spp.)**

3. **Lighting**: Consider the amount of natural light your closet office receives. Plants that thrive in low light conditions, such as the Snake Plant and Peace Lily, are ideal for darker spaces.

4. **Air Quality Concerns**: If you have specific air quality concerns (e.g., formaldehyde, benzene, or trichloroethylene), certain plants are better suited to address these. For example, the Spider Plant and Peace Lily are effective at removing formaldehyde, while the Snake Plant is good for benzene.

### Example Calculation:
- If your closet office is 100 square feet, you would need 1 large plant or 3 small plants.
- If it's 200 square feet, you would need 2 large plants or 6 small plants.

### Additional Tips:
- **Air Purifiers**: Consider using an air purifier in addition to plants, as they can complement each other in improving air quality.
- **Maintenance**: Ensure you can maintain the plants properly, as overwatering or neglect can harm them and potentially affect air quality.

By considering these factors, you can determine the appropriate number of plants to help clean the air in your closet office."

  interaction: {
    traditional: ""More face-to-face interaction with instructors and peers"",
    online: ""Less face-to-face interaction, but can use discussion forums and video conferencing""

1. **Hormonal Imbalance**: Low body fat can disrupt hormonal balance, particularly affecting estrogen levels. This can lead to irregular menstrual cycles, amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), and other reproductive issues.

2. **Metabolic Issues**: A very low body fat percentage can affect metabolism, potentially leading to fatigue, weakness, and difficulty maintaining energy levels.

3. **Bone Health**: Low body fat can contribute to a decrease in bone density, increasing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.

4. **Immune Function**: Adequate body fat is necessary for proper immune function. Low body fat can weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections and illnesses.

5. **Psychological Effects**: Low body fat can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and body image issues, especially if it is the result of restrictive eating or excessive exercise.

6. **Physical Performance**: While some athletes may have low body fat as part of their training regimen, for the general population, very low body fat can impair physical performance and endurance.

If you or someone you know has a body fat percentage below 16%, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the underlying causes and to develop a plan to address any potential health concerns."

20. What's is the sum of the squares of all factors of 210?","To find the sum of the squares of all factors of 210, we first need to determine its prime factorization and then use properties of divisors and their squares.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 210
\[ 210 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \]

### Step 2: List All Factors of 210
The factors of 210 can be found by considering all combinations of its prime factors:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, 210 \]

### Step 3: Sum of the Squares of the Factors
To find the sum of the squares of all factors, we use the property that if \( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} \), then the sum of the squares of the divisors of \( n \) is given by:
\[ \sigma_2(n) = (1 + p_1^2 + p_1^4 + \cdots + p_1^{2e_1})(1 + p_2^2 + p_2^4 + \cdots + p_2^{2e_2}) \cdots (1 + p_k^2 + p_k^4 + \cdots + p_k^{2e_k}) \]

For \( n = 210 = 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 \), we have:
\[ \sigma_2(210) = (1 + 2^2)(1 + 3^2)(1 + 5^2)(1 + 7^2) \]

### Step 4: Calculate Each Term
\[ 1 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 \]
\[ 1 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10 \]
\[ 1 + 5^2 = 1 + 25 = 26 \]
\[ 1 + 7^2 = 1 + 4"

However, `v.ParentName` is not a valid property in Lua or Luau.

If you want to access the `Parent` property of an object and then get the `Name` of that parent, you would do it like this:

```lua
local parentName = v.Parent.Name
```

Here's a breakdown of what this does:
- `v.Parent` accesses the `Parent` property of the object `v`.
- `.Name` accesses the `Name` property of the parent object.

Make sure that `v` has a `Parent` property, and that `Parent` has a `Name` property. If `v` does not have a parent, `v.Parent` will be `nil`, and attempting to access `.Name` on `nil` will result in an error.

If you want to check if `v` has a parent before accessing its `Name`, you can do:

```lua
local parentName = v.Parent and v.Parent.Name or ""No Parent""
```

This will assign `""No Parent""` to `parentName` if `v.Parent` is `nil`."

This can be useful for automation and scripts, but it's important to use this feature carefully to avoid security risks.

Here's how to set up passwordless sudo for a specific user or command:

### 1. **Edit the sudoers File**
   The sudoers file is the configuration file for sudo. You need to edit this file to allow passwordless sudo.

   - **Using `visudo`:**
     The `visudo` command is recommended because it checks the syntax of the sudoers file before saving it, which helps prevent syntax errors that could prevent sudo from working at all.

     ```sh
     sudo visudo
     ```

   - **Adding the Configuration:**
     You can add a line to allow a specific user to run all commands without a password, or you can specify a specific command.

     - **For a specific user:**
       ```sh
       username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
       ```
       Replace `username` with the name of the user you want to allow passwordless sudo.

     - **For a specific command:**
       ```sh
       username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/command
       ```
       Replace `username` with the user and `/path/to/command` with the path to the command you want to allow.

### 2. **Save and Exit**
   After adding the configuration, save the file and exit the editor. If you used `visudo`, it will automatically save and exit.

### 3. **Test the Configuration**
   You can test the configuration by running a command with sudo and verifying that it does not prompt for a password.

   ```sh
   sudo /path/to/command
   ```

### 4. **Security Considerations**
   - **Limit the Scope**: Be as specific as possible when granting sudo privileges. Instead of allowing `NOPASSWD: ALL`, consider allowing only specific commands or groups of commands.
   - **Use Groups**: You can also add users to a group and grant sudo privileges to that group. This can help manage permissions more effectively.
   - **Regular Audits**: Regularly review the sudoers file and the permissions granted to ensure they are still necessary and secure.

### Example of a More Secure Configuration
If you want to allow a user to run a specific command without a password, you can"

""The Jacaranda Blooms"" by Chip Livingston is a vivid and evocative poem that paints a scene of vibrant, almost surreal beauty. The poem begins by describing a jacaranda tree in bloom beside a ""drunk stick tree,"" setting a whimsical and colorful backdrop. The poet then calls out to the reader, inviting them to come and see, and to hear the ""venteveos"" (a type of bird) shrieking into the night. The jacaranda's petals are described as ""violent violet"" and are personified as weeping pollen. The poem also introduces a ""bichofeo,"" a bird that sings of the jacaranda with an open throat and beak, adding to the auditory imagery. The poet then repeats the line about the jacaranda blooming, reinforcing the central image. The poem concludes with the poet's own observations, seeing the jacaranda swelling with nectar and hearing it shriek. Overall, the poem is a celebration of nature's beauty and the vivid, almost magical quality of the jacaranda's bloom."

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy contracted by 20.4% in April, May, and June due to the coronavirus lockdown, performing worse than other major industrial nations, with Scotland experiencing a 19.4% decline."

Here are a few examples:

1. **Matching `=` literally:**
   ```python
   import re

   pattern = r'='
   text = ""a=b=c""

   matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
   print(matches)  # Output: ['=', '=']
   ```

2. **Using `=` in a pattern:**
   If you want to match a literal `=` in a more complex pattern, you can do so without escaping it:
   ```python
   import re

   pattern = r'a=b'
   text = ""a=b=c""

   matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
   print(matches)  # Output: ['a=b']
   ```

3. **Escaping `=` in a special context:**
   If you want to match the `=` symbol as part of a special regex pattern (e.g., a quantifier or a character class), you would need to escape it:
   ```python
   import re

   pattern = r'a\=b'
   text = ""a=b=c""

   matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
   print(matches)  # Output: ['a=b']
   ```

In summary, you do not need to escape the `=` symbol unless it is part of a special regex pattern or you want to match it in a context where it has a special meaning."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that Donald Trump has broken a presidential record by playing golf more than 70 times during his first year in office. This statistic serves as a backdrop for Kimmel's critique of Trump's accomplishments, suggesting that while Trump has spent significant time on leisure activities, he has not achieved much in terms of policy. Kimmel implies that Trump's focus on golf is at odds with the expectations for a president to address important issues, such as healthcare reform, which Kimmel himself has been critical of but sees potential in."

Your task is to generate the fill-in-the-blank question for this answer based on the given article. The blanks are always at the end of the question, and can be filled with more than one word or phrase.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

It's a quaint little park nestled in the heart of the city, surrounded by towering skyscrapers and bustling streets. Despite its proximity to the urban chaos, this park is a peaceful oasis, a sanctuary from the noise and stress of everyday life.

As I step into the park, the first thing that strikes me is the lush greenery that surrounds me. The trees are tall and majestic, their branches reaching out to embrace the sky. The leaves rustle gently in the breeze, creating a soothing symphony of nature. The grass is soft and inviting, a perfect place to sit and relax.

But what truly makes this park special is the pond in the center. The water is crystal clear, reflecting the surrounding trees and buildings like a mirror. Ducks and geese swim gracefully across the surface, their feathers glistening in the sunlight. Children splash and play in the shallow end, their laughter echoing through the park. The sound of water trickling over the rocks and into the pond creates a calming background noise that helps me unwind and let go of any worries.

As I walk around the pond, I notice the benches and picnic tables scattered throughout the park. Families and friends gather here to enjoy each other's company, sharing stories and laughter. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, and the sound of birds chirping and singing adds to the peaceful atmosphere.

What I love most about this park is the sense of community it fosters. Strangers strike up conversations, sharing stories and making new friends. People of all ages and backgrounds come together to enjoy the beauty of nature and each other's company. It's a reminder that despite our differences, we are all connected and can find joy in simple things.

This park is more than just a place to escape the city; it's a place where I can recharge my batteries, find peace, and connect with others. It's a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there is still beauty and joy to be found. Every time I visit, I leave feeling refreshed, renewed, and grateful for the simple pleasures in life."

Below is a conceptual design for data exchange between two companies using Azure Storage Queues. This design will outline the key components and steps involved in setting up and using Azure Storage Queues for this purpose.

### Conceptual Design: Data Exchange Between Two Companies Using Azure Storage Queues

#### Components:
1. **Azure Storage Account**: A central storage service where queues are hosted.
2. **Queue Names**: Unique names for the queues, one for each company.
3. **Sender Company**: The company sending data.
4. **Receiver Company**: The company receiving data.
5. **Azure Functions or WebJobs**: Optional, used for processing messages from the queue.
6. **APIs**: Optional, used for sending messages to the queue.

#### Steps:

1. **Setup Azure Storage Account**:
   - Create an Azure Storage Account in the Azure Portal.
   - Enable Queues in the storage account.

2. **Create Queues**:
   - Create a queue for each company.
   - For example, `SenderQueue` and `ReceiverQueue`.

3. **Sender Company Setup**:
   - **Message Creation**: The sender company creates messages containing the data to be exchanged.
   - **Message Sending**: The sender company sends messages to the `ReceiverQueue` using an API or Azure Functions.
   - **Message Structure**: Ensure the message structure is consistent and includes all necessary data fields.

4. **Receiver Company Setup**:
   - **Message Retrieval**: The receiver company polls the `ReceiverQueue` for messages.
   - **Message Processing**: The receiver company processes the messages, extracting the data and performing any necessary actions.
   - **Acknowledgment**: The receiver company acknowledges the receipt of the message to prevent duplicate processing.

5. **Optional: Use Azure Functions for Processing**:
   - **Trigger**: Set up an Azure Function to trigger when a new message is added to the queue.
   - **Function Logic**: The function can process the message, perform any necessary actions, and then delete the message from the queue.

6. **Security and Authentication**:
   - **Access Control**: Use Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage access to the storage account and queues.
   - **Authentication**: Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication and authorization.

7. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - **Azure Monitor**: Set up Azure Monitor to track the performance and health of the queues.
   - **Logging**: Enable"

Sails are typically made of materials such as canvas, nylon, or polyester, which are visible and tangible. However, the force that propels a sailboat is indeed invisible, as it comes from the wind, which is made up of air molecules in motion. Here are some key points to clarify this:

1. **Wind is Invisible**: Wind is the movement of air, and air itself is invisible. The force that moves the sail is the wind, which is an invisible phenomenon.

2. **Sail Material is Visible**: The sail itself is made of visible materials like fabric, which can be seen and touched.

3. **Sail Shape and Wind Interaction**: The shape and design of the sail are crucial in capturing and directing the wind. When the sail is properly oriented to the wind, it creates lift, which is the force that moves the boat.

4. **Pressure Differences**: The wind creates pressure differences on the sail, causing it to fill and move. These pressure differences are not visible but can be felt and measured.

In summary, while the force that drives a sailboat (the wind) is invisible, the sail itself is a tangible, visible object made of fabric or other materials."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

3. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed data using techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings. Word embeddings can capture the semantic meaning of words and their relationships, which can help the model detect subtle nuances in language.

4. Model Selection: Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for sentiment analysis, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We can also use ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to improve the model's accuracy.

5. Model Training: Train the selected model on the preprocessed and feature-extracted data. We can use cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data.

6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We can also use confusion matrices to visualize the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.

7. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a production environment where it can be used to analyze new textual content and provide sentiment predictions.

8. Model Maintenance: Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain it periodically with new data to ensure that it remains accurate and up-to-date.

By following these steps, we can develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately differentiate positive and negative emotions expressed in textual content using advanced natural language processing techniques."

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string into a short, shareable string in JavaScript, you can use a combination of base64 encoding and URL-safe encoding. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Base64 Encoding**: Convert the string to a base64 encoded string.
2. **URL-Safe Encoding**: Convert the base64 string to a URL-safe format by replacing certain characters and ensuring it's URL-friendly.

Here's a complete example:

```javascript
function encodeString(input) {
    // Step 1: Convert the string to a base64 encoded string
    const base64Encoded = btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(input)));
    
    // Step 2: Replace '+' with '-' and '/' with '_' to make it URL-safe
    const urlSafeEncoded = base64Encoded.replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_').replace(/=/g, '');
    
    return urlSafeEncoded;
}

function decodeString(encoded) {
    // Step 1: Replace '-' with '+' and '_' with '/'
    const urlSafeDecoded = encoded.replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/');
    
    // Step 2: Pad the string with '=' to make it a valid base64 string
    const padded = urlSafeDecoded + '=='.slice((urlSafeDecoded.length % 4) || 4);
    
    // Step 3: Convert the base64 string back to the original string
    const decoded = decodeURIComponent(escape(atob(padded)));
    
    return decoded;
}

// Example usage
const originalString = ""This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";
const encodedString = encodeString(originalString);
console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);

const decodedString = decodeString(encodedString);
console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base64 Encoding**:
   - `encodeURIComponent` is used to encode the string to handle special characters.
   - `unescape` is used to decode the encoded string.
   - `btoa` is used to convert the string to a base64 encoded string.

2. **URL-Safe Encoding**:
   - Replace `+` with `-` and `/` with `_` to make the base64 string URL-safe.
   - Remove any trailing `=` characters, which are padding characters in base"

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node using a heuristic search algorithm, we can use the A* search algorithm. A* search uses a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal, which in this case is the Manhattan distance (also known as taxicab or city block distance).

The heuristic function \( h(n) \) for a node \( n \) is the Manhattan distance from \( n \) to the goal node. The cost function \( f(n) \) is the sum of the cost from the start node to \( n \) (g(n)) and the heuristic estimate from \( n \) to the goal (h(n)):

\[ f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \]

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz and achieve the ideal foam and bloom, follow these steps and tips:

### Ingredients:
- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz egg white
- 1 oz lemon juice
- 1 oz lime juice
- 1 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz orange flower water
- 1 oz cream
- Soda water (Topo Chico is recommended)
- Ice cubes (small, about 3-4)

### Equipment:
- Cocktail shaker
- Strainer
- Collins glass

### Instructions:

1. **Dry Shake:**
   - Add the gin, egg white, lemon juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your cocktail shaker.
   - Shake vigorously without adding ice for about 2 minutes. This helps to emulsify the egg white and incorporate air into the mixture, which is crucial for creating the foam.

2. **Add Ice and Shake Again:**
   - Add a small amount of ice (about 3-4 small cubes) to the shaker.
   - Shake again until the mixture is well-chilled or until the ice has mostly melted. This ensures the drink is cold and the ingredients are fully combined.

3. **Strain and Serve:**
   - Pour the soda water into a Collins glass first.
   - Strain the cocktail over the soda water.
   - The meringue should separate from the liquid, and the foam should rise to the top. If it doesn't, don't worry; the drink will still taste great.

### Tips for Achieving the Ideal Foam and Bloom:

1. **Shake Vigorously:**
   - The key to a good Ramos Gin Fizz is the foam. Shake the mixture vigorously for at least 2 minutes to incorporate air and create a rich, creamy foam.

2. **Use Small Ice Cubes:**
   - Using smaller ice cubes can help create smaller bubbles and a finer foam. This is because smaller ice cubes melt more quickly, which can help maintain the texture of the foam.

3. **Emulsify the Egg White:**
   - Ensure the egg white is well-emulsified with the other ingredients. This helps create a smooth, creamy texture and a stable foam.

4. **Use the Right Ingredients:**
   - Use high-quality ingredients, especially the egg white and orange flower water. The egg white should be fresh and the orange flower"

This process is part of the broader quality management system (QMS) that production organizations must implement and maintain. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how EASA evaluates suppliers:

### 1. **Supplier Evaluation Process**
   - **Initial Assessment:** EASA assesses the supplier's quality management system (QMS) to ensure it meets the requirements of the relevant EASA regulations and standards. This includes checking the supplier's documentation, procedures, and processes.
   - **On-Site Audits:** EASA conducts on-site audits to verify that the supplier's QMS is effectively implemented and maintained. These audits are comprehensive and cover all aspects of the supplier's operations, including production, testing, and quality control.
   - **Product Evaluation:** EASA may also evaluate the actual products supplied by the supplier to ensure they meet the required safety and quality standards. This can include sampling and testing of products.

### 2. **Quality Management System (QMS) Requirements**
   - **ISO 9001:** Many suppliers are required to have a certified ISO 9001 quality management system. EASA may require suppliers to provide evidence of this certification.
   - **EASA Part 21 Subpart M:** For suppliers of aviation products, EASA Part 21 Subpart M (Suppliers and Subcontractors) provides specific requirements for the quality management system. Suppliers must demonstrate compliance with these requirements.
   - **EASA Part 21 Subpart O:** This subpart covers the quality management system for suppliers of maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services.

### 3. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - **Regular Audits:** EASA conducts regular audits to ensure that suppliers continue to meet the required standards. These audits can be unannounced and are designed to identify any issues that may have arisen since the last audit.
   - **Performance Reviews:** EASA may review the supplier's performance data, such as defect rates, to assess the supplier's ongoing compliance with quality and safety standards.
   - **Corrective Actions:** If issues are identified during audits or performance reviews, EASA may require the supplier to take corrective actions to address these issues.

### 4. **Certification and Registration**
   - **Supplier Certification:** In some cases, EASA may require suppliers to be"

**John Doe (JD):** Great to be here.

**H:** Let's start with a brief overview of the current state of renewable energy. Emily, can you give us a snapshot?

**EC:** Absolutely. Currently, renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power account for about 27% of global electricity generation. Solar and wind have seen the most significant growth in recent years, with costs dropping dramatically. However, we still face challenges like intermittency and storage, which we'll discuss later.

**H:** John, what are some of the economic and political factors that impact renewable energy adoption?

**JD:** Certainly. Economically, the cost of renewable energy technologies has decreased significantly, making them more competitive with fossil fuels. However, subsidies and tax incentives play a crucial role. Politically, there's a mix of support and resistance. Countries with strong environmental policies tend to adopt renewables more quickly, while others lag behind due to economic interests or lack of political will.

**H:** That's interesting. Emily, what technological advancements do you see on the horizon that could significantly impact renewable energy?

**EC:** There are several exciting developments. For solar, perovskite solar cells could offer higher efficiency and lower costs. In wind, floating offshore wind farms could unlock vast new resources. Energy storage technologies, like advanced batteries and pumped hydro, are improving, which is crucial for addressing intermittency. Additionally, smart grids and AI can optimize energy distribution and consumption.

**H:** Those are fascinating advancements. John, how do these technological changes affect the economic and political landscape?

**JD:** Technological advancements can drive down costs and increase efficiency, making renewables more attractive. This can lead to increased adoption and potentially reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Politically, it can shift the debate from cost to benefits, such as job creation and reduced pollution.

We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.

A group has the following properties: uid, name, thumbnail\_url, creation\_date
This API must be written in Python, using FastAPI and pydantic for DTO.
DTO names must end with ""DTO"".
I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","Certainly! Below is an example of a REST API using FastAPI and Pydantic to manage groups of users. The API will include separate DTOs for read and write operations.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages
First, make sure you have FastAPI and Uvicorn installed. You can install them using pip:

```sh
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

### Step 2: Define DTOs

We'll define two DTOs: one for creating or updating groups (`GroupWriteDTO`) and another for reading groups (`GroupReadDTO`).

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class GroupWriteDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: str

class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: int
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: str
```

### Step 3: Define the Group Model

We'll define a simple in-memory model to store the groups. In a real-world application, you would likely use a database.

```python
groups = []
```

### Step 4: Define the API Endpoints

Now, we'll define the API endpoints using FastAPI.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends
from typing import List, Optional
from datetime import datetime

app = FastAPI()

# In-memory storage for groups
groups = []

# Dependency to get the current date
def get_current_date() -> str:
    return datetime.now().strftime(""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"")

# Endpoint to create a new group
@app.post(""/groups/"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
def create_group(group: GroupWriteDTO, current_date: str = Depends(get_current_date)):
    group_dict = group.dict()
    group_dict[""uid""] = len(groups) + 1
    group_dict[""creation_date""] = current_date
    groups.append(group_dict)
    return GroupReadDTO(**group_dict)

# Endpoint to get a group by UID
@app.get(""/groups/{group_id}"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
def read_group(group_id: int):
    for group in groups:
        if group[""uid""] == group_id:
            return GroupReadDTO(**group)
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=""Group not found"")

# Endpoint to get all groups
@app.get(""/groups/"", response"

These differences can be influenced by various factors such as climate, availability of hosts, and local ecosystems. Here are some general observations:

1. **Climate and Seasonality**: In regions with distinct seasons, Tabanus species may have different flight patterns. For example, in temperate regions, they might be more active during the warmer months, while in tropical regions, they could be active year-round.

2. **Host Availability**: The abundance and distribution of hosts (such as horses, cattle, and humans) can influence flight patterns. In areas with a high density of hosts, Tabanus may be more concentrated in certain areas, leading to more predictable flight paths.

3. **Elevation and Topography**: In mountainous regions, flight patterns might be influenced by elevation changes. For instance, Tabanus species might be more common in lower elevations where temperatures are warmer and hosts are more abundant.

4. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Some Tabanus species have developed specific behaviors to cope with local conditions. For example, some species might be more active during the day in some regions, while others might be more active at dawn or dusk.

5. **Predation Pressure**: The presence of predators can also influence flight patterns. In regions with a high predation pressure, Tabanus might be more elusive and less predictable in their flight patterns.

While these general trends exist, it's important to note that specific studies and local observations are necessary to understand the detailed flight patterns of Tabanus in different regions."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
