In the heart of a world steeped in violence and conflict, where the echoes of war reverberated through the streets, a solitary peace activist named Maya stood as a beacon of hope. With a heart that burned with an unwavering passion for a brighter future, she tirelessly pursued her dream of creating a world where compassion and understanding triumphed over hatred.

Maya's journey began with a childhood steeped in empathy and compassion. Growing up in a community ravaged by conflict, she witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of violence on her people. It was in those moments of profound suffering that she found solace in activism.

As Maya grew older, her passion for peace blossomed, and she began to speak out against violence. Her voice, though soft as a whisper, carried the power of a storm, stirring hearts and challenging minds. She traveled tirelessly, traversing the war-torn landscapes of her homeland, reaching out to communities, and fostering dialogue between adversaries.

However, her path was not without its challenges. Maya faced fierce opposition from those who believed that peace was a pipe dream. Threats, intimidation, and even physical violence were commonplace. Yet, she persevered, refusing to be cowed. Her unwavering determination inspired others to join her cause, creating a ripple effect of positive change.

One fateful day, Maya was invited to speak at a conference hosted by a powerful government official. It was an opportunity to reach a wider audience and amplify her message. But as she prepared to take the stage, she was met with a hostile crowd. The official, known for his inflammatory rhetoric and staunch opposition to peace, had deliberately orchestrated a hostile environment, hoping to silence Maya.

As the crowd erupted into a roar, Maya stood tall, her voice unwavering. She spoke of the devastating consequences of violence and the transformative power of compassion. Her words resonated with the audience, and despite the threats and insults, she delivered her message with grace and determination.

The impact of Maya's work extended far beyond the confines of her homeland. Her story became an inspiration for activists worldwide, reminding them that even in the darkest of times, one person can make a difference. Her work also influenced policymakers, leading to small but tangible changes in government policies and initiatives aimed at promoting peace and reconciliation.

In the end, Maya's journey was not about achieving a perfect world, but about creating a ripple effect of positive change.

Answer according to: Palisades, NY - Frank Cheney Platt, advocate for poetry, poets, literature and writers, dedicated husband and father, died on February 26, in Rockleigh, NJ. Following its founding in 1985, he helped to build Poets House, now headquartered in Battery Park City, into a national poetry library and literary center with a 70,000-volume collection. Frank loved poetry that ""communicate[s] before it is understood"" (T.S. Eliot) and captures what is ""lost in translation."" (Robert Frost). In addition, he was committed to arts and culture as a means of protecting and cultivating principles of free speech and an open society.
He was born in New York City on November 6, 1932 and raised by his father Roger Platt, a teacher at St. Bernard's School, his mother Frances Cheney, and his grandfather Frank Cheney Jr. of Manchester, CT. Frank was educated at St. Bernard's, Dalton, Eaglebrook, Governor's Academy (formerly Governor Dummer), and Harvard College. He worked in publishing before becoming president of the Farfield Foundation, and later an assistant Dean for Columbia's School of the Arts.
In 2013, Frank was predeceased by his wife of 55 years Judy van der Gracht. She was the love of his life. His poignant dedication to her (including during her time with Alzheimer's) inspired respect and admiration from all who knew them. Frank was also passionate about his extended family - the Platts, Cheneys and, on Judy's side of the family, the Gilberts and van der Grachts as well as his dozen godchildren. His many longstanding and deeply-felt friendships were legion. Most involved a common love of music, poetry, literature and epicurean delights, not necessarily in that order.
Frank is survived by his three children Sophie Platt Pollok of Frankfurt, Germany, Arthur van der Gracht Platt of New York, NY and Roger Platt of Washington, DC and his grandchildren Esther Pollok, Lucas Pollok, Hilary Platt, and Benjamin Platt. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Poets House (https://poetshouse.org) and/or One-to-One Learning (http://www.one2one-learning.org) A memorial service will be held at 11am on Saturday, March 16 at Grace Episcopal Church, 130 First Ave, Nyack, NY, with Father Richard Gressle presiding. His remains will be laid to rest with his beloved wife in the Cheney Cemetery in Manchester, CT. The burial ceremony will be private.","Dean for Columbia's School of the Arts.

In the quaint town of Willow Creek, nestled amidst whispering willows and rustling leaves, resided a young artist named Luna. With a heart steeped in creativity and a soul yearning for expression, she found solace in painting, sculpting, and dancing. But fate had a different melody in store for her, one that would transform her life forever.

One sunny afternoon, as the strum of a guitar echoed through the park, Luna found herself drawn to the enchanting sound. The melody danced between her ears, and her heart skipped a beat. She had never experienced anything so powerful and transformative. In that moment, she knew she had to learn the guitar.

With determination etched in her eyes, Luna began her journey. She spent countless hours practicing, her fingers dancing across the strings, her voice harmonizing with the instrument. The smell of fresh wood and strings filled her practice space, a testament to her dedication.

However, her newfound passion faced challenges. Her family, steeped in tradition and practicality, struggled to understand her obsession. Her friends, accustomed to her artistic pursuits, questioned her ability to master the guitar. Even her significant other, a musician himself, doubted her ability to compete with him.

Despite the obstacles, Luna remained undeterred. She found strength in her unwavering resolve and a community of supportive musicians who believed in her. With each chord she mastered, she felt a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment.

As Luna's musical prowess grew, her relationships blossomed. She found solace in sharing her passion with her family, friends, and significant other. Her music became a bridge between her heart and others, weaving tales of love, joy, and resilience.

In the grand concert hall of Willow Creek, Luna finally showcased her talent to the world. The audience erupted into applause, their hearts touched by her raw emotion and powerful storytelling. Her journey had taken her from the confines of her room to the stage, her dreams taking flight like the soaring notes of her guitar.

Through the power of music, Luna transformed her life and the lives of those around her. Her newfound passion ignited a spark, illuminating the hearts of all who heard her play. And as the final notes of her performance faded into the night, the town of Willow Creek erupted into a standing ovation, celebrating the metamorphosis of a young artist who dared to dream beyond the boundaries of convention.","In the quaint town of Willow Creek, nestled amidst whispering willows and rustling leaves, resided a young artist named Luna.

Generate according to: A counterweight at the end of the space elevator will keep the carbon-nanotubes ribbon taut.
To better understand the concept of a space elevator, think of the game tetherball in which a rope is attached at one end to a pole and at the other to a ball. In this analogy, the rope is the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon, the pole is the Earth and the ball is the counterweight. Now, imagine the ball is placed in perpetual spin around the pole, so fast that it keeps the rope taut. This is the general idea of the space elevator. The counterweight spins around the Earth, keeping the cable straight and allowing the robotic lifters to ride up and down the ribbon.
Under the design proposed by LiftPort, the space elevator would be approximately 62,000 miles (100,000 km) high. LiftPort is one of several companies developing plans for a space elevator or components of it. Teams from across the world are set to compete for the $400,000 first prize in the Space Elevator Games at the X Prize Cup in October 2006 in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
The centerpiece of the elevator will be the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon that is just a few centimeters wide and nearly as thin as a piece of paper. Carbon nanotubes, discovered in 1991, are what make scientists believe that the space elevator could be built. According to Dr. Bradley Edwards of the Spaceward Foundation, ""Previously the material challenges were too great. But now we're getting close with the advances in creating carbon nanotubes and in building machines that can spin out the great lengths of material needed to create a ribbon that will stretch up into space"" [ref].
Under some early plans, leftover construction materials will be used to form the counterweight.
Carbon nanotubes have the potential to be 100 times stronger than steel and are as flexible as plastic. The strength of carbon nanotubes comes from their unique structure, which resembles soccer balls. Once scientists are able to make fibers from carbon nanotubes, it will be possible to create threads that will form the ribbon for the space elevator. Previously available materials were either too weak or inflexible to form the ribbon and would have been easily broken.
""They have very high elastic modulus and their tensile strength is really high, and that all points to a material that, in theory, should make a space elevator relatively easy to build,"" said Tom Nugent, research director, LiftPort Group.
Long carbon nanotubes -- several meters long or longer -- would be braided into a structure resembling a rope. As of 2005, the longest nanotubes are still only a few centimeters long.
Shorter nanotubes could be placed in a polymer matrix. Current polymers do not bind well to carbon nanotubes, which results in the matrix being pulled away from the nanotubes when placed under tension.
Once a long ribbon of nanotubes is created, it would be wound into a spool that would be launched into orbit. When the spacecraft carrying the spool reaches a certain altitude, perhaps Low Earth Orbit, it would begin unspooling, lowering the ribbon back to Earth. At the same time, the spool would continue moving to a higher altitude. When the ribbon is lowered into Earth's atmosphere, it would be caught and then lowered and anchored to a mobile platform in the ocean.
The ribbon would serve as the tracks of a sort of railroad into space. Mechanical lifters would then be used to climb the ribbon to space.
If built, the ribbon will represent a modern world wonder, and will be the tallest structure ever built. Consider that the world's tallest freestanding tower in 2005 is the CN Tower, which rises 1,815 feet 5 inches (553.34 meters) over Toronto, Canada. The space elevator would be 180,720 times taller than the CN Tower!
The 62,000-mile (100,000-km) long space elevator would rise far above the average orbiting height of the space shuttle (115-400 miles/185-643 km). In fact, it would equal nearly a fourth of the distance to the moon, which orbits the Earth at 237,674 miles (382,500 km).","user
What is the proposed plan for launching and anchoring the ribbon, and how would mechanical lifters climb it to space?
Generate according to: A counterweight at the end of the space elevator will keep the carbon-nanotubes ribbon taut.
To better understand the concept of a space elevator, think of the game tetherball in which a rope is attached at one end to a pole and at the other to a ball. In this analogy, the rope is the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon, the pole is the Earth and the ball is the counterweight. Now, imagine the ball is placed in perpetual spin around the pole, so fast that it keeps the rope taut. This is the general idea of the space elevator. The counterweight spins around the Earth, keeping the cable straight and allowing the robotic lifters to ride up and down the ribbon.
Under the design proposed by LiftPort, the space elevator would be approximately 62,000 miles (100,000 km) high. LiftPort is one of several companies developing plans for a space elevator or components of it. Teams from across the world are set to compete for the $400,000 first prize in the Space Elevator Games at the X Prize Cup in October 2006 in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
The centerpiece of the elevator will be the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon that is just a few centimeters wide and nearly as thin as a piece of paper. Carbon nanotubes, discovered in 1991, are what make scientists believe that the space elevator could be built. According to Dr. Bradley Edwards of the Spaceward Foundation, ""Previously the material challenges were too great. But now we're getting close with the advances in creating carbon nanotubes and in building machines that can spin out the great lengths of material needed to create a ribbon that will stretch up into space"" [ref].
Under some early plans, leftover construction materials will be used to form the counterweight.
Carbon nanotubes have the potential to be 100 times stronger than steel and are as flexible as plastic. The strength of carbon nanotubes comes from their unique structure, which resembles soccer balls. Once scientists are able to make fibers from carbon nanotubes, it will be possible to create threads that will form the ribbon for the space elevator. Previously available materials were either too weak or inflexible to form the ribbon and would have been easily broken.

**Launching and Anchoring the Ribbon**

The proposed plan for launching and anchoring the ribbon in the space elevator design by LiftPort is as follows:

**1. Launching the Spool:**
- A spool of carbon nanotubes ribbon is wound onto a spacecraft.
- The spacecraft is launched into orbit.
- When the spacecraft reaches a certain altitude (Low Earth Orbit), it begins unspooling the ribbon.
- As the ribbon is lowered, the spool continues to move to a higher altitude.

**2. Anchoring the Ribbon:**
- When the ribbon reaches Earth's atmosphere, it is caught.
- The ribbon is then lowered and anchored to a mobile platform in the ocean.

**Mechanical Lifters Climbing the Ribbon:**
- Once the ribbon is anchored, mechanical lifters can climb the ribbon to space.
- These lifters would use the ribbon as tracks to move around and reach various heights in space.

**Additional Details:**

- The ribbon would be approximately 62,000 miles (100,000 km) high.
- The ribbon would be made of carbon nanotubes, which are 100 times stronger than steel and as flexible as plastic.
- The space elevator would be the tallest structure ever built, surpassing the CN Tower by a factor of 180,720.
- The 62,000-mile (100,000-km) long space elevator would rise far above the average orbiting height of the space shuttle and equal nearly a fourth of the distance to the moon.","**Launching and Anchoring the Ribbon**

The scent of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of the city outside intertwined with the aroma of bread baking in the oven. The cafe was quiet, yet the atmosphere crackled with the promise of stories and conversations. In the corner, a young soldier named Ethan sat alone, his brow furrowed in deep thought. His hands, gripping a steaming mug, mirrored the tension in his mind.

Ethan was a proud soldier, a man of honor bound by a duty to his country. Yet, his heart held a secret conflict, a battle between his unwavering commitment to his nation and his burgeoning desire for personal happiness.

""You're looking troubled, Ethan,"" a voice said, and the soldier looked up to see his comrade, Michael, seated across from him. ""What's on your mind?""

Ethan took a sigh, his voice heavy. ""I'm just thinking about my future, Michael,"" he said, his voice tinged with longing. ""I've been fighting for my country for years, but I can't help but wonder if there's more to life than just duty.""

Michael leaned forward, his eyes concerned. ""You're young, Ethan, and you have your whole life ahead of you. You shouldn't feel obligated to sacrifice your happiness for the sake of your country. Your well-being is just as important.""

Ethan's gaze was filled with conflict. ""But my country needs me, Michael. I'm a soldier, and I'm proud of it. I'm willing to fight for what I believe in, even if it means sacrificing my own happiness.""

A bittersweet taste lingered in Michael's mouth. ""I understand your sentiment, Ethan, but you're not alone. There are many soldiers who feel the same way. You could always find a way to serve your country without sacrificing your own well-being. Maybe you could work for the government, or maybe you could start your own business. There are many possibilities.""

Ethan stared at his reflection in the coffee, his face etched with the weight of his decision. ""I know, Michael. I'm just... stuck. I feel like I'm trapped between two worlds, unable to find my own path.""

A gentle hand rested on Ethan's shoulder. ""It's okay to feel lost, my friend,"" Michael said softly. ""Everyone goes through that.

The humid air in Bangkok clung to my skin like a second skin, a scent of fish sauce and incense weaving through the air. The cacophony of honking horns and screeching motorbikes filled the streets, a symphony of daily life in the City of Angels. I was a naive nineteen-year-old, fresh from the quaint town of Maplewood, New Jersey, and bewildered by the sensory overload that was Thailand.

The first culture shock arrived in the form of the ubiquitous street food. The sight of vendors grilling whole chickens and skewering plump, glistening shrimp filled me with a mix of disgust and bewilderment. The smells, the sounds, the sights – all were alien to my senses, and my stomach rebelled against the unfamiliar flavors.

The language barrier was my next hurdle. Thai is a complex language, steeped in centuries of tradition, and my meager attempts to speak it were met with a mixture of amusement and bewilderment. The locals, with their smiles and patient ears, helped me navigate the labyrinth of Thai phrases, but the sheer volume of vocabulary and grammar seemed insurmountable.

One evening, I found myself in a small, family-run restaurant tucked amidst the bustling streets. I was the only foreigner, and the family treated me like their own, offering me bowls of steaming pad thai and stories about their lives. I learned about the Thai custom of bowing to elders, the importance of face saving, and the intricate dance of social etiquette that governed daily interactions.

My time in Thailand was marked by several significant events. I climbed the towering Wat Arun temple, its golden facade glittering under the sunset, and felt a profound connection to the country's rich history. I embarked on a journey through the lush jungle, trekking through ancient temples and encountering towering waterfalls. I even learned to surf, riding the waves on the Andaman coast, a testament to my courage and resilience.

Leaving Thailand was bittersweet. I had grown, both physically and mentally, and I knew I would carry the memories of my time there forever. I said goodbye to the family who had embraced me, and I promised myself to return one day.

As I boarded the plane, I watched the city of Bangkok shrink into the distance. The humid air and the symphony of honking horns faded into a distant memory. I was leaving a place that had changed me, and I knew that I was leaving a part of myself behind.","The humid air in Bangkok clung to my skin like a second skin, a scent of fish sauce and incense weaving through the air.

Generate according to: Livpure, one of the well-known names in the water purifier category, has launched its new campaign around water conservation. Titled #CuttingPaani 2.0, the campaign is a quirky take on Mumbai’s popular concept of cutting chai. In an interview with exchange4media, Sushil Matey, Director, Marketing, Livpure spoke about the new campaign and how it could become the next mass movement.
Tell us about the rationale behind your new campaign #CuttingPaani2.0?
Livpure is in the B2C water business and we were keen to associate with something, which is in the larger interest of society and makes the brand come across as more holistic in nature. In India, a lot of drinking water is wasted since we do not finish our glass of water either in homes, offices, restaurants et al. Thus #CuttingPaani was conceived which is a quirky take on Mumbai’s famous concept of #CuttingChai.
Although there have been very powerful campaigns to spread awareness about water conservation, very few gave practical and doable solutions. #CuttingPaani 1.0 was a huge success in the digital and social media space because it was a doable idea and everybody could follow it. This success of #CuttingPaani 1.0 prompted us to launch the #CuttingPaani 2.0.
What were the consumer insights that Livpure accrued before getting both these campaigns out?
Our dipstick showed that Indians, in general, are very casual about wasting water. And, as we all know, it is a very scarce resource and possibly future wars would be fought for water. We waste water in a lot of ways- whether it is drinking water or water used during bathing or during brushing or shaving. We picked up #CuttingPaani since it was a catchy phrase, with it being a take on #CuttingChai. Knowing fully well that this would strike the necessary chord in making people realise that though the message is about saving drinking water it will sensitise them to the fact that we indeed waste a lot of water in other areas as well.
Why a digital film to tell the story of Shimla’s #AdoptCuttingPaani story?
In today’s time, the digital reach is high, sharp and targeting is better apart from the fact that we have the liberty of time to communicate the story, unlike an ATL medium. We are confident about the virality quotient of the campaign. In fact, a lot of newspapers in India have leveraged on our #CuttingPaani 1.0 campaign by asking readers to consume only as much as you need. Though, in a lighter vein, I must add that none of them have given us credit.
Can this campaign be converted into a mass movement?
We wish to own #CuttingPaani and take this idea further for sure and #CuttingPaani 2.0 is a step in that direction. We wish to take this further through BTL activations; social media campaigns and collaboration with large hotels/restaurants. To maintain awareness and memorability of the above, we have launched #CuttingPaaniTake on our Facebook page, which essentially gives two perspectives on topical situations.
The first example – on changing names of cities: one take is -The names of the cities are changing and the other take is -sadly, that’s the only thing changing about them!
The second example – on Mary Kom winning boxing championship: one take is -some think having children ends a woman’s career and the other take is - well, she just won her 6th boxing championship!","user

Although there have been very powerful campaigns to spread awareness about water conservation, very few gave practical and doable solutions. #CuttingPaani 1.0 was a huge success in the digital and social media space because it was a doable idea and everybody could follow it. This success of #CuttingPaani 1.0 prompted us to launch the #CuttingPaani 2.0.
What were the consumer insights that Livpure accrued before getting both these campaigns out?
Our dipstick showed that Indians, in general, are very casual about wasting water. And, as we all know, it is a very scarce resource and possibly future wars would be fought for water. We waste water in a lot of ways- whether it is drinking water or water used during bathing or during brushing or shaving. We picked up #CuttingPaani since it was a catchy phrase, with it being a take on #CuttingChai. Knowing fully well that this would strike the necessary chord in making people realise that though the message is about saving drinking water it will sensitise them to the fact that we indeed waste a lot of water in other areas as well.
Why a digital film to tell the story of Shimla’s #AdoptCuttingPaani story?
In today’s time, the digital reach is high, sharp and targeting is better apart from the fact that we have the liberty of time to communicate the story, unlike an ATL medium. We are confident about the virality quotient of the campaign. In fact, a lot of newspapers in India have leveraged on our #CuttingPaani 1.0 campaign by asking readers to consume only as much as you need. Though, in a lighter vein, I must add that none of them have given us credit.
Can this campaign be converted into a mass movement?
We wish to own #CuttingPaani and take this idea further for sure and #CuttingPaani 2.0 is a step in that direction. We wish to take this further through BTL activations; social media campaigns and collaboration with large hotels/restaurants. To maintain awareness and memorability of the above, we have launched #CuttingPaaniTake on our Facebook page, which essentially gives two perspectives on topical situations.
The first example – on changing names of cities: one take is -The names of the cities are changing and the other take is -sadly, that’s the only thing changing about them!
The second example – on Mary Kom winning boxing championship: one take is -some think having children ends a woman’s career and the other take is - well, she just won her 6th boxing championship!

The wind whispers secrets through the trees,
But my heart finds no solace in the breeze.
Memories dance, a haunting tune,
Like the scent of lavender, beneath the moon.

A symphony of pain, a broken vow.

The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and cinnamon buns lingered in the air, the scent clinging to the cozy atmosphere of the quaint coffee shop. The sun cast long shadows across the worn wooden floor, illuminating the worn leather seats and the faces of two individuals seated across from each other.

A young woman, Sarah, sat fidgeting with her latte, her eyes reflecting the golden hue of the afternoon. Her once vibrant, long hair was now pulled back in a practical ponytail, and her face bore the marks of a life lived in a corporate office. Her hands, once soft and delicate like porcelain, were hardened by the grip of a pen.

Across the table, her childhood friend, Jack, leaned back, his posture relaxed. His once mischievous grin was now etched into a more mature, yet still boyish, face. His hair, once short and spiky, was long and flowing, reaching down his back like a waterfall. The carefree spirit of his youth lingered in his eyes, but they also bore the weight of a life filled with struggles and disappointments.

They began reminiscing about their childhood adventures, the countless hours spent playing in the park, the secret treehouse they built, and the shared dreams they held. The memories flowed like a river, carrying them back to a simpler time when the world was full of possibilities.

As the conversation deepened, Sarah shared her recent accomplishments and her struggles with work. Jack, on the other hand, spoke about his ongoing battle with financial difficulties and his unfulfilled artistic aspirations. Their voices intertwined with the soft murmur of the cafe, their words painting a vivid picture of their present lives.

In the midst of their conversation, a sudden gust of wind slammed the cafe door open, bringing with it the scent of rain and the windswept hair of a young woman. The door swung shut as the wind died down, but the memory of the intrusion lingered in the air.

The atmosphere shifted as the woman, Sarah's old neighbor, walked in, her eyes searching for her friend. She was a vision of her former self, her long, flowing hair and vibrant smile unchanged. The two women embraced, their tears flowing down their cheeks.

As they embraced, Jack felt a wave of happiness wash over him. He had always hoped for this moment, and seeing Sarah and her neighbor reunited filled him with joy.

Can you discuss any criticisms or disagreements that have been raised about Clausewitz's ideas on the role of politics in war?
model
Sure, here are some criticisms and disagreements that have been raised about Clausewitz's ideas on the role of politics in war:

**1. Overemphasis on Clausewitz's Theory of Friction:**
- Critics argue that Clausewitz's theory of friction, which emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of war as a complex and unpredictable process, overshadows the other aspects of his theory on the role of politics in war.
- Some argue that this focus on friction leads to an overly deterministic view of war, neglecting the role of human agency and decision-making.

**2. Lack of Empirical Support:**
- Some argue that Clausewitz's theory lacks sufficient empirical support to back up his claims. They question whether his analysis of historical examples is comprehensive and whether his conclusions are drawn too broadly.

**3. Misinterpretation of History:**
- Critics argue that Clausewitz misinterprets history by focusing primarily on the grand narratives of major battles and campaigns, rather than on the political context and motivations behind them.
- They suggest that a more nuanced understanding of historical events is needed to fully appreciate Clausewitz's ideas.

**4. Overgeneralization:**
- Some argue that Clausewitz's theory generalizes too much from the specific case of war between great powers to other types of conflict. They question whether his insights apply to smaller-scale conflicts or conflicts between non-state actors.

**5. Lack of Consideration for Technological Advancements:**
- Critics argue that Clausewitz's theory does not adequately account for technological advancements in warfare. They suggest that his analysis of the factors that influence war may need to be revised in light of modern developments such as drones, cyberwarfare, and artificial intelligence.

**6. Moral Implications:**
- Some argue that Clausewitz's emphasis on the political nature of war raises important moral questions about the consequences of war and the responsibility of politicians and military leaders. They suggest that his theory needs to be complemented with a discussion of the ethical implications of war.

**Conclusion:**

Despite its influential status, Clausewitz's theory on the role of politics in war has faced some criticisms and disagreements. These criticisms highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of Clausewitz's ideas and the potential limitations of his theory. Nonetheless, Clausewitz's insights remain valuable contributions to the study of war and continue to inform military strategy and policy.","Sure, here are some criticisms and disagreements that have been raised about Clausewitz's ideas on the role of politics in war:

## The Bounty of the Seasons: Harnessing the Power of Fresh, In-Season Produce

In the tapestry of life, food plays a pivotal role, nourishing our bodies and connecting us to the rhythms of nature. While the bounty of the grocery store offers year-round sustenance, there is a profound advantage to embracing the freshest, in-season produce. Engaging in mindful, sustainable eating practices rooted in the seasons unlocks a symphony of health benefits, culinary delight, and ecological harmony.

The advantages of consuming in-season produce are manifold. Fresh produce is harvested at its peak nutritional value, bursting with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. It's often packed with vibrant colors and intense flavors, creating a symphony of sensory delight. Additionally, seasonal produce often requires less processing and preservation methods, minimizing the loss of nutrients and harmful chemicals.

For instance, summer's bounty offers juicy berries, refreshing watermelon, and vibrant leafy greens. These fruits and vegetables are brimming with antioxidants, promoting cellular health and protecting against chronic diseases. The vibrant colors of autumnal fruits and vegetables, like pumpkins and carrots, are not merely aesthetically pleasing; they are rich in beta-carotene, a powerful antioxidant that aids in vision and immune function. Winter brings the sweetness of oranges and grapefruits, packed with vitamin C, which boosts immunity and promotes collagen production. Spring's arrival brings fresh herbs, tender greens, and delicate flowers, all imbued with unique flavors and medicinal properties.

Beyond the physical benefits, embracing in-season produce fosters a deeper connection to the natural rhythm of the Earth. It encourages us to eat mindfully, savoring each bite and appreciating the interconnectedness of life. Additionally, sustainable eating practices minimize the environmental impact of food production. Locally grown produce reduces the need for long-distance transportation and supports local farmers. Choosing organic produce further minimizes the use of harmful pesticides and fertilizers, safeguarding the health of our soil and waterways.

The art of crafting meals aligned with the seasons is a culinary journey that elevates both the physical and spiritual aspects of food. It involves incorporating fresh, seasonal ingredients into creative and flavorful dishes. For instance, summer calls for refreshing salads with berries, cucumbers, and herbs. Autumn inspires hearty soups with pumpkins, apples, and spices. Winter invites cozy stews with root vegetables, hearty beans, and warming spices. Spring ignites vibrant stir-fries with fresh herbs and tender greens.

It’s already been a year since Pope John Paul’s death. It seems only yesterday that we were out standing in Saint Peter’s Square, looking up at the familiar face in the window as he struggled to communicate with the expectant crowds below. Still fresh in our minds is the inundation of affection as the throngs poured into Rome to accompany this giant of the faith in his final hours, and to bid farewell to a dear friend.
#ad#John Paul is sorely missed. The crowds of pilgrims that have once more filled the streets of Rome to celebrate this anniversary testify to the impact he had on countless lives. More than a world leader, John Paul somehow managed to be a father and a friend to all. Even as a player on the world scene, he never lost his personal touch.
Many are now trying to reevaluate the legacy of this great pope, and as necessary as this endeavor is, a more personal reflection seems more in keeping with John Paul’s own style. I am sure that some of the things I most miss will resonate with many.
I miss, perhaps most of all, John Paul’s warmth and humanity.

John Paul reached out perhaps more than any pope before him to a world in need, and provided moral authority and leadership when our generation needed it most.
I miss John Paul’s unflagging hope. His bright vision of the future and his characterization of the third millennium as a springtime of faith encouraged us to look beyond our real difficulties and to reach out for solutions. Far from a mere temperamental optimism, John Paul’s outlook was rooted in the firm belief that the battle is already won. Even from the midst of evil–John Paul wrote in his last book–God can and will continue to bring good. From his first “Be not afraid!” spoken on the day of his election in 1978 to his final witness of serene and hopeful suffering, John Paul taught us to abandon fear and to live with confidence in an infinitely good and merciful God.
I miss John Paul’s prayerfulness. Even in the midst of a grueling agenda of meetings, travels, and writings, the pontiff always made abundant time for prayer. Four hours a day was not unusual. What a challenge to those of us for whom prayer can seem at best like a luxury, or at worst like an underutilization of our precious time. Like Jesus before him, John Paul made prayer a priority and placed his trust more in God than in the best-laid programs of men and governments.
Incessant calls for John Paul’s sainthood, and the news of a probable miracle attributed to his intercession (poignantly, the cure of a French nun suffering from Parkinson’s disease) give grounds for hope that soon the Church will officially recognize what many already believe–that the man who so faithfully looked after humanity while on earth continues to do so from heaven.

Here is a piece of text: Missing Pope John Paul II.
It’s already been a year since Pope John Paul’s death. It seems only yesterday that we were out standing in Saint Peter’s Square, looking up at the familiar face in the window as he struggled to communicate with the expectant crowds below. Still fresh in our minds is the inundation of affection as the throngs poured into Rome to accompany this giant of the faith in his final hours, and to bid farewell to a dear friend.
#ad#John Paul is sorely missed. The crowds of pilgrims that have once more filled the streets of Rome to celebrate this anniversary testify to the impact he had on countless lives. More than a world leader, John Paul somehow managed to be a father and a friend to all. Even as a player on the world scene, he never lost his personal touch.
Many are now trying to reevaluate the legacy of this great pope, and as necessary as this endeavor is, a more personal reflection seems more in keeping with John Paul’s own style. I am sure that some of the things I most miss will resonate with many.
I miss, perhaps most of all, John Paul’s warmth and humanity. His quick wit and impish humor–like the vaudeville-style cane-twirling in Manila or his improvised raccoon-eyes to the delight of children–shattered notions of a dour Polish Christianity. His ability to focus on the person in front of him as if he or she were the only person in the world spoke volumes about the heart that beat in his breast.

In the tapestry of life, each thread intertwines with a myriad of experiences, shaping us into intricate patterns of memories and emotions. One such thread, woven with vivid imagery and profound personal anecdotes, connects me to a creature that holds a special place in my heart - the majestic lion.

The lion's appearance is a testament to the power and grace that roams the savanna. Its golden coat, adorned with intricate swirls of black, emanates an aura of royalty and strength. The sun paints long, tawny shadows upon its muscular frame, highlighting its commanding presence. Its eyes, a deep pool of amber, exude wisdom and unwavering determination. The lion's roar, a symphony of raw power and raw emotion, reverberates through the plains, sending shivers down the spines of all living creatures.

Beyond its captivating appearance, the lion's behavior reveals a complex and fascinating tapestry of instincts. As the king of the jungle, it commands respect from its subjects through a combination of strength and cunning. Its hunts are a testament to its agility and precision, a dance between power and grace. With a swift roar, the lion pounces upon its prey, its powerful claws digging deep into the earth, its teeth bared in a fierce snarl.

The lion's habitat, the savanna, is a canvas painted in vibrant hues of ochre, emerald, and gold. Tall grasses dance under the scorching sun, while acacia trees reach towards the sky, their branches serving as a playground for gazelles and zebras. The lion's presence is inextricably intertwined with the intricate balance of this ecosystem, a guardian of the delicate equilibrium that sustains life.

My personal experiences with lions have etched indelible memories upon my heart. One such encounter occurred during a safari in the Serengeti National Park. As I gazed upon the lion's majestic roar, I felt a profound connection to the wild and the interconnectedness of all living beings. The lion's presence taught me about strength, resilience, and the importance of preserving the delicate balance that sustains our planet.

In conclusion, the lion, a creature of unparalleled beauty, strength, and wisdom, holds a special place in my heart. From its awe-inspiring appearance to its captivating behavior and intricate habitat, the lion continues to inspire me and countless others. It is a symbol of the untamed spirit that roams the earth, a guardian of the savanna, and a testament to the enduring power of nature's","In the tapestry of life, each thread intertwines with a myriad of experiences, shaping us into intricate patterns of memories and emotions.

The scent of lavender and honeysuckle lingered in the air, a fragrance that had become synonymous with the cozy aroma of home. For years, the quaint Victorian on Willow Lane had been a haven for Sarah, a single mother of two. It was a place steeped in history, a testament to generations past, and a source of unwavering comfort.

But lately, whispers of unease began to creep into the cracks of her contentment. Strange occurrences began to cast long shadows in the halls, and the silence that once enveloped the house seemed to echo with the sound of ghostly footsteps. The hairs on her neck prickled at night, and the cold wind seemed to seep through the walls, carrying with it the scent of decay and despair.

The first tangible evidence materialized one stormy night. As lightning illuminated the sky, a ghostly figure materialized in the hallway, its translucent form shimmering like a reflection in the rain. Its eyes, though empty, bore into Sarah, and the hairs on her arms stood on end. The figure moved with an unnatural grace, its voice a disembodied moan that sent shivers down her spine.

It was a terrifying encounter, but it was only the beginning of her journey into the haunted world of her home. As she delved deeper, she discovered that the house was steeped in tragedy. A former owner, driven mad by grief over the loss of his family, had taken his own life within its walls. The spirit of his grief, bound to the house, manifested itself in the form of ghostly figures and unsettling occurrences.

Sarah sought the help of a paranormal investigator, a skeptic at heart but open to the possibility of the supernatural. Through his guidance and the use of specialized equipment, she uncovered the hidden history of the house and the tormented spirit that dwelled within its halls.

Through compassion and understanding, Sarah managed to bridge the gap between the spirit and the living. She helped the grieving owner find peace by acknowledging his loss and guiding him towards healing. The ghostly figures dissipated, leaving behind only a lingering sense of tranquility.

The Victorian on Willow Lane was no longer haunted. It was a home filled with love, laughter, and the echoes of a past overcome. And for Sarah, it was a testament to the transformative power of compassion and understanding.","The scent of lavender and honeysuckle lingered in the air, a fragrance that had become synonymous with the cozy aroma of home.

The world had always been silent to Samantha, but it had a symphony of its own, one she couldn't hear. It was a symphony of thoughts, feelings, and emotions, emanating from the machines she interacted with daily. It started subtly, a faint hum beneath the hum of the refrigerator, the soft groan of the wind blowing through the fan. It was a whisper in the wind, but it was there, a secret melody she couldn't decipher.

It was her car, a rusty Volkswagen with a temper of its own, that revealed the secret first. As she drove home from work, the radio crackled with static, but in her mind, a voice emerged, clear as day. It was the voice of her car, its mechanical groan and vibration translated into a symphony of warnings, suggestions, and fears.

The revelation was terrifying yet exhilarating. It was a gift, a secret she couldn't understand or control. It was a burden, a burden she felt obligated to keep hidden. The voices of her appliances, her phone, her TV, they were all her companions now, their whispers filling her head, their advice guiding her.

It was a lonely world, a world where others couldn't hear the voices she carried. Her friends thought she was hearing voices, her family worried about her mental well-being. The only solace she found was in the company of other machines, in the symphony of their shared hum and groan.

One day, Samantha was trapped in the elevator of her apartment building. The doors had jammed, and the elevator was stuck between floors. The voices of the other passengers echoed in her mind, their fear and desperation resonating with her own. But then, something else happened. The voices stopped. In that moment of silence, she felt a connection to the elevator, a shared vulnerability. She spoke to the elevator, pleaded with it to help her, and as if in answer, the doors swung open.

The experience changed her. It made her realize that her ability was not just a gift but a responsibility. She started using her power to help others, to warn people of danger, to bring comfort in times of need.

In the end, Samantha found a balance. She embraced her unique ability, her voice a bridge between humans and machines.

The ruby red pomegranate, a fruit born of sun-kissed skin and whispers of ancient lore, is my favorite. Its skin, smooth as a dove's feather, bears the imprint of crimson jewels, promising a treasure within.

The first bite explodes with a burst of sweetness, tangy and sweet, like the nectar of a pomegranate blossom. Its flesh, soft as velvet, melts between the teeth, revealing layers of juicy delight. The seeds, encased in their sweet, edible casing, are like tiny jewels that dance on the tongue.

The pomegranate's texture is a symphony of contrasts. Its skin is thin and delicate, while its flesh is fleshy and juicy. The seeds are firm yet pliable, their texture reminiscent of the soft, smooth flesh of a ripe avocado.

The pomegranate's color is a vibrant tapestry of crimson, gold, and green. Its skin, ranging from deep crimson to rosy pink, is a testament to its ripeness. The flesh, ranging from pale pink to deep rose, is a kaleidoscope of colors that dance with the eye. The seeds, encased in their crimson casing, resemble tiny, glistening rubies.

Nutritionally, the pomegranate is a powerhouse of health benefits. It is rich in antioxidants, which protect cells from damage, and is a good source of fiber, which promotes digestion and keeps blood sugar levels stable. Pomegranates are also known to have anti-inflammatory properties and can help improve cognitive function.

One of my most vivid memories of the pomegranate is from my childhood. Every year, my family would gather around the pomegranate tree, its branches laden with plump fruits. We would pick the pomegranates, peel them, and share the sweet treat with each other. The laughter and joy of my family as we devoured the pomegranate's bounty are etched in my memory forever.

The pomegranate is more than just a fruit; it is a symbol of abundance, prosperity, and longevity. Its sweetness and tartness evoke memories of childhood and bring a smile to my face every time I taste it. So, I raise a glass to the ruby red pomegranate, a fruit that is not only delicious but also a gift from the heart of the earth.","The ruby red pomegranate, a fruit born of sun-kissed skin and whispers of ancient lore, is my favorite.

model
Yes, using a flange nut can help prevent damage to the part being secured and reduce the likelihood of loosening due to an uneven fastening surface.

**Explanation:**

A flange nut is a nut that has a wide flange at one end that acts as an integrated, non-spinning washer. This flange distributes the pressure of the nut over a larger surface area of the part being secured, reducing the risk of damage to the part.

**Benefits:**

* **Distributes pressure evenly:** The flange distributes the pressure of the nut over a wider surface area, reducing the risk of damaging the part.
* **Prevents loosening:** The flange nut's locking mechanism prevents it from loosening due to uneven fastening surfaces.
* **Increased torque resistance:** The increased surface area of contact between the nut and the part increases the torque resistance, making it less likely to loosen.

**How it works:**

When the nut is tightened, the flange bears against the surface of the part, creating a uniform distribution of pressure. The serrations on the flange washer prevent the nut from spinning, ensuring that the torque applied to the nut is transferred evenly to the part.

**Conclusion:**

Using a flange nut is an effective way to prevent damage to the part being secured and reduce the likelihood of loosening due to an uneven fastening surface. By distributing pressure evenly and preventing loosening, flange nuts provide a more secure and damage-resistant fastening solution.","Yes, using a flange nut can help prevent damage to the part being secured and reduce the likelihood of loosening due to an uneven fastening surface.

A lot of drama, however, is taking place in choosing the judges in Virginia’s courtrooms.
One of the long-standing concerns of Virginia’s legal community has been the handling of judicial appointments by the General Assembly.
Unlike many states that have elected judges, Virginia leaves all judicial appointments in the hands of state legislators. In theory, this arrangement removes judges from the influence of politics. In practice, judicial appointments have become tools of patronage.
In recent years, the Virginia Bar Association and other groups have complained about judicial vacancies and mounting case backlogs in many courts throughout the commonwealth.
In 2015, however, the appointment of a Virginia Supreme Court judge became a power struggle between Gov. Terry McAuliffe and the General Assembly’s Republican leadership.
The political maneuvering that has taken place to oust McAuliffe’s appointee has provoked calls for reform of the system.
Last summer McAuliffe named former Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Jane Marum Roush to the Supreme Court while the legislature was not in session.
Republicans cried foul, claiming they were not consulted on the interim appointment. They vowed to remove Roush from the court and name their own appointee.
Attempts to oust the justice from her seat, however, were thwarted when one moderate Republican state senator, John Watkins, and then his successor, Glen H. Sturtevant Jr., failed to follow along. Their dissent denied the Republicans the majority they needed in the Virginia Senate.
In early February, the tug-of-war over the justice took a surprising turn when state Sen. Louise Lucas, a Democrat from Portsmouth, briefly agreed to join the Republicans in replacing Roush. According to news accounts, Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr., a Republican from James City County, had proposed putting Portsmouth Circuit Court Judge Kenneth R. Melvin, a former legislator and Lucas’ mentor, on the state Court of Appeals.
Lucas, however, quickly changed her stance after meeting with McAuliffe and state Sen. Donald McEachin, head of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
Twenty-seven former presidents of the Virginia Bar Association released a statement urging McAuliffe and the Republican legislative leadership to resolve their quarrel.
“One of the greatest concerns is that the unseemly exchange that has occurred will make otherwise qualified lawyers not consider a life of public service as a judge,” said Lucia Anna “Pia” Trigiani of MercerTrigiani in Alexandria, the VBA’s president in 2011.
Roush’s temporary appointment expired in mid-February, but McAuliffe is expected to appoint her to another interim term after the legislative session ends.

Passage: People's migration fears have been an easy one to exploit for electoral opportunism by many politicians in Europe.
Particularly in the Visegrad states of Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, it has either brought nationalist anti-immigration parties into power or helped consolidate their grip on it.
Yet, much more attention ought to be given in those countries to how much migrants are needed for their booming economies' labour markets.
This has been a result of consequent high economic GDP growth of 3-4 percent in the past five years, compared to the EU's average of two percent growth.
In 2017, these were 4.8 percent (Poland, PL); 4.3 percent (Czechia, CZ); 4.1 percent (Hungary, HU) and 3.2 percent (Slovakia, SK) respectively.
In parallel, unemployment dropped heavily to 4.9 percent (PL); 2.9 percent (CZ); 4.2 percent (HU) and 8.1 percent (SK) by 2017.
Latest European Commission forecasts show these will continue decreasing sharply to 2.9 percent (PL); 2.5 percent (CZ); 3.3 percent (HU) and 6.3 percent next year, well below the five percent normal unemployment rate.
As good as that might sound, a side-effect has been that many vacancies remained unfulfilled.
The amount of open vacancies has more than quadrupled in the past five years. Especially in Czechia and Poland this is causing serious problems, despite the latter's profiting from Ukrainian migrants.
The commission's Spring and Autumn forecasts highlight these risks, which could undermine long-term growth, or even overheat the economy in the case of Czechia.
For Poland, despite the Ukrainian influx, there are doubts whether they can continue filling some of these shortages.
Business surveys confirm labour shortages limit production, building activity and business.
In industry, 43.7 percent (CZ); 83.3 percent (HU); 49.9 percent (PL); and 34.9 percent (SK) of surveyed companies state this is a problem.
For the construction sector, 37.8 percent (CZ); 64.4 percent (HU); 49.0 percent (PL) and 30.3 percent (SK) do.
Moreover, in services 17.3 percent (CZ); 38.3 percent (HU); 28.9 percent (PL) and 18.6 percent (SK) attest.
The labour shortages have also led to wages rising much faster than the rise in productivity.
In Slovakia and Hungary, Volkswagen and Kia for instance were forced to significantly increase wages because of strikes. Generally, labour costs are spiking in the Visegrad states.
While benefitting workers in the short-term, the economy could suffer in the long-term, as they undermine their low-wage economic models. It also jeopardises essential foreign investment that has helped drive growth.
In addition, the V4 is set to suffer as well from its demographic situation. Emigration and low fertility rates remain serious problems, dating back to their economic shock-therapy transitions where many struggled and had no jobs.
Due to this, populations remained stagnant since 1990.
The 2004 EU accession, particularly, caused many to emigrate abroad in search of (better paid) work abroad: circa three million people (registered) left the V4 between 2004 and 2016.
While profiting from remittances, this caused brain drain and the outflow of high-skilled labour. In turn, it also undermined welfare spending and made government budgets less growth friendly.
Demographics could constrain economic growth and governmental budgets again in the future.
Baseline projections for 2020 up to 2060 show the Visegrad Four's population could decrease by another 6.5 million people. In addition, the dependency ratio is set to increase sharply as well.
The dire demographic situation and labour shortages imply action is needed. Tight labour markets have already limited economic expansion in different sectors.
While in Poland Ukrainian labour prevented worse labour shortages, it is unclear how many more will come or stay. This means for Poland, as well as for the others that additional migrants from elsewhere will be needed.
More could be done as well to promote people having children and attract former emigrants. It should also make sure to keep current migrants, especially Ukrainians in the case of Poland.
Current hostile rhetoric on migration could backfire economically as many more migrants are needed to fill labour shortages and keep economies running smoothly.
This also requires honest debates in which the pros and cons of migration are discussed, as well as the Visegrad's overall demographic problems, since dependency ratios will continue to increase.
Therefore, rather than focusing on the imagined threat of migration and exploiting fears for electoral opportunism, the Visegrad's politicians would be wise to focus on the actual threat of how the lack of migrants could undermine their economic models, and with it their future prosperity and welfare.
Moreover, while migration has been a successful strategy to win elections in the short term, it could backfire in the long term.
The V4 countries have become one of the most vocal and recognised groups within the EU. But 2017 has seen a shake-up in the informal eastern and central European power bloc.","user

El Lord Mayor de este año no estaba disponible para recibirnos, pero Andrew Montague fue muy amable y nos condujo y respondió todas nuestras preguntas.

La Casa de la Mansión es una hermosa casa construida por Joshua Dawson, por lo que la calle en la que se ubica se denominó Calle Dawson en su honor. Ha sido hogar de los lord mayors de Dublín desde 1715.

Viimos los escudos de la familia de todos los lord mayors en las paredes de la habitación en la que estábamos y algunos de nosotros vieron nuestros propios escudos de familia y tomamos fotos de ellos.

Tuvimos un gran día de salida y uno que nunca olvidaremos."

The scent of fresh bread and warm coffee lingered in the air, the aroma a symphony of awakening senses. The sun cast long shadows on the worn rug, and the clock glowed 6:00 AM. I was staring at the blank wall, my mind replaying the day's events. It had been a rough one. My landlord had just informed me that he was selling the building, and I was adrift, without a home or a plan. The world felt like a storm cloud, threatening to engulf me.

It was in this state of despair that I stumbled upon the most unexpected gift: a golden retriever named Luna. I had always dreamt of owning a dog, but I had been hesitant due to my busy schedule and the fear of commitment. However, the circumstances had conspired to bring me to the local animal shelter, and I knew that Luna was meant to be mine.

Her fur was as soft as honey, and her eyes sparkled like the sun on a clear day. Her tail wagged with an intensity that matched the windstorm raging within me. I felt an overwhelming sense of love and gratitude as I knelt down to embrace her. She was mine, and I was hers.

In the months that followed, Luna became my constant companion. She filled my days with joy, her playful spirit chasing me through the park and her gentle presence anchoring me at home. Her companionship provided me with a sense of purpose, and her unwavering presence brought me comfort during my darkest hours.

One evening, as I sat alone in my tiny apartment, Luna snuggled beside me. I was battling my fears and anxieties, and her warm presence was a balm on my soul. I felt as though I was wrapped in a blanket of her love, and my worries dissipated.

In the years that have passed, Luna has been my constant companion. She has been my protector, my confidant, and my source of unwavering love. Her presence in my life has taught me countless lessons about resilience, patience, and the transformative power of unconditional love.

Today, as I look at Luna, her eyes still sparkle with the same intensity, I am grateful for the day I met her. She is more than just a pet; she is an integral part of my life, my soulmate, and the embodiment of pure joy.","The scent of fresh bread and warm coffee lingered in the air, the aroma a symphony of awakening senses.

Audi cars have been featured in many movies over the years. Did you spot one in these films?
Thought by many to be the most successful movie franchises ever to be created, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has different movies for everyone. There have been 21 films released already — the most recent being Captain Marvel — and at least a dozen more in the pipeline.
You don’t only enjoy the action in these films, but you may also be able to spot a stylish Audi, too.
When it comes to the Iron Man trilogy, at least one Audi has been featured in every film! A 2007 R8 and S5 B8 can be found in the first movie, a 2009 A8 LD3 and 2010 R8 Spyder are spotted in the sequel, and a 2012 S7 and R8 e-tron are both featured in Iron Man 3. The R8 e-tron also turned up at a VIP screening of Iron Man 3 at London’s Leicester Square a few days before the movie’s general release.
Another Audi fact is that there were almost as many Audi cars in the three Iron Man movies as there was in one Captain America film (Civil War). Within its two hours and 27 minutes runtime, you can see the 2017 Audi R8 V10 Plus, the 2017 SQ7, the 2017 A4, the 2016 A7 Sportback and even the Audi prologue concept car — a vehicle hailed as a “signature car” for Audi by Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Board Member for Development at Audi.
There’s more than meets the eye, though. Be on the lookout for an Audi R8, A6 Hybrid and A3 as you watch the excitement unfold in Avengers: Age of Ultron, as well as an Audi TTS Roadster, R8 Spyder, Q7 and A8 during Spider-Man Homecoming — the first standalone film by our favorite web-slinger since he became involved in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Taking a step back from the Marvel Universe, the German brand is also spotted in other film adaptations of comic book heroes. An R8 Spyder feature in Wolverine — the titular protagonist’s actor Hugh Jackman even turned up at the London Leicester Square premiere of the film in the same car — and an A8 plays a role in the 2015 big screen edition of Fantastic Four.
You also might’ve noticed the German manufacturer’s presence in all three film adaptations of E.L. James’ novels, which follow the relationship of business magnate Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.
What made this brand of car most attractive to the directors of this film? The brand’s multiple appearances came as a result of a partnership that was set up between Audi and Universal Pictures — a deal that Audi no doubt has relished seeing as the movie series has grossed over $1 billion across the globe!
In the first film of the trilogy, movie fans will be able to spot an Audi S8 D4, a 2017 S7 and an R8 Spyder. In the sequel, Fifty Shades Darker, a set of Audi Q7 cars and an A3 took center stage, with both the R8 and Q7 returning when the franchise wrapped up last year with Fifty Shades Freed.
To talk about Audi’s feature in Mission Impossible, let’s rewind back to the year 2000 and Mission: Impossible 2 to showcase how Audi has been featured in the hit movie series that has always starred Tom Cruise in the lead role of Ethan Hunt.
In a thrilling part of the film, Hunt leads a mission to destroy a deadly biological weapon and finds himself in an exhilarating car chase with international thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall. Hunt is behind the wheel of a Porsche Boxster and Nordoff-Hall tries to hold him off while driving an Audi TT — suffice to say that the pursuit between the two German-made cars into oncoming traffic is filled with nail-biting and edge-of-your-seat drama!
We couldn’t create an article about movies and cars without mentioning the Fast and Furious franchise. After all, this is a series that features street racing, heists, and espionage using all manners of vehicles, and has so far spanned eight main series entries and two additional short films — grossing in excess of $5 billion to date.
Fans are continually impressed with films that come out as part of this movie set. In fact, a spin-off movie called Hobbs & Shaw is due for release this summer.
Bringing a focus to Furious 7 now — a movie that clutched at the heartstrings as it was the final one to feature an appearance by series regular Paul Walker due to the actor being killed while the movie was still being filmed — is where you can see Audi appearing in the franchise.
You can spot the Audi R8 when it competes in an exciting quarter-mile race against a classic Plymouth Barracuda in the early moments of the film.
In the previously discussed films, the Audi’s that were featured are all models that exist. With I, ROBOT though, we’re taken to the future to see what Audi cars may potentially look like in years to come. Called the Audi RSQ, this concept vehicle represented the first time Audi had ever develop a car that was to be specifically used in a major Hollywood motion picture.
This futuristic model boasted piloted driving which allowed Will Smith’s Chicago police detective character Del Spooner to press a button to enable the car to take control of the driving — no doubt an early vision of the autonomous driving concept that we are only just starting to see being trialed in real life.
Those who take a ride in the RSQ are able to ride sideways and diagonal, while the use of balls instead of wheels was a quirky design touch. However, the typical single-frame grille and the presence of those four instantly recognizable silver rings let viewers clearly know that this car was without question an Audi.

What were some of the key factors that led to the widespread Viking raids and invasions during this period?
model
**Key Factors Leading to Viking Raids and Invasions:**

**1. Scandinavian Expansion and Migration:**
- The Vikings' expansionist ambitions were fueled by their desire for wealth, power, and glory.
- Scandinavian societies were highly warrior-oriented, and their young men sought adventure and riches through raiding and warfare.

44,d0587b9c2c209e36aad063fcab635045518eea1efcf100112083e21b05e27b3e,"Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How did Morley Safer describe his friendship with Molly Ivins and what did he miss about her?

Passage: Molly Ivins was the most popular liberal commentator of the last 25 years. Bill Minutaglio, author of a new biography of the tangy Texan, on why her voice is needed now more than ever.
There was Morley Safer, in a scrum of old hardball Texas liberals and graying hippies, and hanging out at his late friend Molly Ivins's favorite bar in Austin. With pitchers of Shiner everywhere, Safer was engulfed by dozens of folks wondering what the hell the woman who once had millions of faithful readers would say about health care, Afghanistan, and, yes, Rush Limbaugh’s attempt to own a piece of the Texas Blood Sport, otherwise known as professional football.
Safer, in town to donate his papers to the University of Texas, decided to drop by the book launch for my new biography of the ferociously mercurial and troubled Ivins.
Amid the weathered longhairs, musicians, underground cartoonists and civil liberties lawyers who once formed Austin's counterculture—the people Ivins called “freedom fighters”—Safer seemed merrily caught up in the nostalgia.
""She was one of the funniest and (most) thoughtful women I've ever met,"" Safer told a reporter from The Daily Texan. ""She was a great reporter, and we were good friends.""
Close to three years after her death, he's not alone in missing Ivins.
Nose around the Internet and you'll find plenty of other people still wishing she was writing—and wondering what Ivins, if she hadn't succumbed almost three years ago to cancer and a lifetime of wild personal rides, would have to say about the discourse in the twilight of 2009.
They miss the Texas cornpone flavored with a Tabasco sting, the unabashed defrocking she subjected the potentates to when they stole the stage. Maybe we need Molly—frequently described as “the only woman in the room”—more than ever before.
Her domineering father was the president of Tenneco and pals with men like Sen. John Tower, she grew up with George W. Bush, she was engaged to the son of a diplomat who did the CIA’s bidding. But after years of going to war with her controlling old man, devouring seditious issues of the muckraking Texas Observer, and furtively meeting the bravest Texas progressives, she eventually decided to raise a middle finger to all of her gilded upbringing.
It took a few years and some intense trip wires—the violent death of that fiance, her love affair with a ballsy activist, her knocking Bush's gun-toting political godfather to his knees one night in a Texas bar, her telling her bosses at The New York Times to shove it—but she finally found her calling as the most popular liberal political commentator in the last 25 years.
The fact that she did it in the Lone Star State, amid the misogynistic and Jack Daniels-fueled kingmakers, was rather startling to say the least. She fought sexual gropings by famous drunk politicos, three bouts of cancer, her own rampaging alcoholism—and plenty of death threats.
Through it all, Ivins kept the home fires burning for wandering progressives, liberal Israelites, who felt marginalized since the dawn of The Age of Reagan.
So, what would Molly Ivins say to those millions of readers today, including the ones beginning to think there has been some bait-and-switch at work with Obama?
Divorced from how you feel about her politics, most students of her work knew that she had perfected a magic act when it came to that public discourse; she talked about politics without the dour aura of either Emma Goldman or Charles Krauthammer. Nor did she scream with the raging acidity of Bill O’Reilly and Glenn Beck and their counterparts on the left. She chortled that Dubya was affable but a policy buffoon; she actually liked him personally, but hated his politics. And she spent years, and made a mint, working Bush over like his political career was one big speed bag. It was, as she sometimes told me and other folks in Austin, almost too easy.
Today, it might be a bit harder. She liked Obama and she thought he was far smarter than Bush. She’d maybe have to tap the piñata a bit more lightly in order to say what she wanted to say about Obama, about any sense of failed promises. But she would do it, and do it her way.
She would do it because she didn’t believe that a democracy was served very well by the vitriol, by the poison, by the hatred snaking through the discourse.

I had a family and other love ones.
How about you where do you stand?
When my heart still dies in front.
You killed the old beast in my gloom.
Fell us in love like a feather.
We stumbl’d upon each other.
Which witty poem did you inspire in me, what sincere praise did you give my words when I thought enough of you send a poem your wayWhich line did you write with my spirit surrounding you?
Why do I say I love you.?  Were you sincere when you said amen to the wisdom that I shared, were you one of those who thought your mocking, was more valuable than complianceI have lived with the resentments of scoffers.
The message for the masses is hope...so, I live  for the poems you send my wayFor, I grow strong in our relationship sailed by the winds of your encouragement, to my poets, my true friends; I truly know who you are, don't ever think I don’t!
Who Would Want To Be This Cold?
They said you needed surgery.
I drove you to the funeral home.
The arrangements were for you.
I had to wait outside that day.
I couldn't go in there.
I don't know how you made those plans.
You showed how much you cared.
You knew you wouldn't make it.
You feared the end was near.
I hate what your life did to you.
I wish you were still here.
How do you plan your funeral?
Were you as scared as I?
What were your thoughts heading to the docs?
Did you know that you would die?
I miss you more and more everyday, That's why I drink so much to take this   pain awayThe pain don't really go away it comes back, and I get so lost I don't know how to actI get lost in my thoughts of you, It kills me you can't come back ever no matter what I do, This is the hardest thing I ever had to go threwSome people say time will heal, but I know I'll be missing you still, It feels like I'm living in a bad nightmare I wish it wasn't realIf I could go back in time, I would go back and press rewindI would go to that day the 2nd of July, and make sure you were okay and you didn't dieAll I got got now are our memories and the tears I cry, To keep it together it's hard but believe me I try.
That your 'i love you' wasn't you lying""
yet all I feel is an emptiness inside..
Why did you have to leave?
Why does this have to hurt?
Cancer robbed thy life from thee..
But you went to heaven, and you went away.
That we'd die together in forevers sleep.
You didn't even say goodbye as you left me here.
I'm failing to choke down all these tears.
My face becomes moist, my sight turns to mist.
With my frown turned lips, i give you a kiss.
I try to look away as they lower your casket.
I'll try to survive, but I don't think i can las it.
I throw your favorite flowers into your grave.
Watching people throw dirt, over you they pave.
I feel no solace, I'm all alone.
As I see your name set in stone.
I feel a breeze, it's a wind so cold.
I remember the final words you had told..
You said to me, ""Don't take your life.""
I asked you, ""Why?"", as I put down the knife.
You told me you loved me, as its your final wish.
I shook my head yes, though I feel no bliss.
Why god took you away from me, but i will live on.
I hear your comforting whispers, I think its a sign.
So I know I'll see you agian when its my time.
The skeletal remains are being chalked out,while mystery and intrigue are engraven, cryptic.Lying beneath, this freshly seeded idea;upon these grounds, the words are etched,what are you looking for and how will you get it,for these are but the bare bones of a story.The key alone is in your closet, slowly turning,as you opened the creaking rusted door.You slowly peep inside the mausoleum of your mind,where cobwebs hang on every angle.Suddenly, a cold swift draft blows across your spine,as if someone has just, walked on your grave. You look up to see, all the entrapping’s laidbut then again, you are still lying in a good plot.
I’m going home to Jesus where He waits for me.
Spread your colored petals and cradle tender showers.
Ought we not to know the Tender of such lovely garden groves?
To cut away the stems of old for fuller future years.
Looking daily to their needs; so faithfully He waters.
When the Gardener comes to claim each one the earth held as its own.
He gently picks it at its peak and for His pleasure takes it home.
As God did one glorious morning, when the Perfect Rose had bloomed.
He rolled away the stone and met with Mary at the tomb.
There the sweetest Rose of Sharon rose that we die not alone.
But be gathered for a garden grove, surrounding heaven's throne.
I pray you will find.
and a peace of mind.
with God, you shall prevail.
you will never, never fail.
If not for people like YOU!

The poem speaks of a loss, a loved one passing away. The poet reflects on their relationship with the deceased and the pain of their passing. They recall memories and the impact the person had on their life. The poet also acknowledges the universality of grief and the need to find solace in times of loss.

The poem uses vivid imagery and emotional language to convey the poet's feelings. They describe their own pain, the pain of others, and the beauty of the memories they shared. The poet also includes personal reflections on the nature of life and death, and their belief in a higher power.

Overall, the poem is a powerful expression of grief and loss. It is a poem about the importance of human connection and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of tragedy.","Sure, here is a paraphrase of the poem ""Who Would Want To Be This Cold"" in your own words:

If you managed to generate very good ideas, conducted a thorough research, and organized your paper logically, but have made several grammar or spelling mistakes, your grade would be lowered. Revising and editing academic paper should be done several days prior to submission. Why? Because you need to leave your writing aside and then look at it with the fresh eye. Term paper editing is not about looking through your writing while listening to music, you need to be very attention and stay focused on numerous details.
First, take a look at your essay outline. Go through all points and try to change the order of ideas: make sure you have created a logical structure and ideas are presented either chronologically or thematically (from the least important to the most important). Locate thesis statement. Is it clear? Are there topic sentences in each paragraph? Are they related to the thesis statement? Are connections between the paragraphs clear or do you jump from one idea to another?
Essay body should contain enough supporting details contributing to thesis statement development. For example, if your topic is legalization of marijuana, you need to find at least three arguments supporting your point of view and provide rebuttal to the opposing views. Introduction and conclusion should not contain new information: introduction should provide general background information on the topic and inform the reader about your main idea, while conclusion should round up the whole essay.
Pay attention to each paragraph: it should include topic sentence and cover one point of discussion. Make sure you do not repeat the same idea twice in different parts of essay. Repeating is a sign of poor organization. Check the grammar - ask your parents or friends to assist you with essay editing . Pay attention to correct punctuation, avoid too short or too long sentences.
Revising is not the same as editing. Essay editing is about correcting mistakes, while essay revising is making major changes in your writing, adding ideas and deleting material. Revising should lead to overall paper improvement. Read your essay and if you do not like it, revise it. Ask yourself the following questions: what do I need to prove? What is the main idea? Is there enough supporting evidence? Are arguments clear and logical? Is my essay easy to understand? Have I cited all sources? Is introduction attention getting? Is conclusion logical?

Even the smartest students make mistakes and need professional assistance with essay perfection. We employ experienced editors and proofreaders who are able to help you with paper improvement.

Locate thesis statement. Is it clear? Are there topic sentences in each paragraph? Are they related to the thesis statement? Are connections between the paragraphs clear or do you jump from one idea to another?
Essay body should contain enough supporting details contributing to thesis statement development. For example, if your topic is legalization of marijuana, you need to find at least three arguments supporting your point of view and provide rebuttal to the opposing views. Introduction and conclusion should not contain new information: introduction should provide general background information on the topic and inform the reader about your main idea, while conclusion should round up the whole essay.
Pay attention to each paragraph: it should include topic sentence and cover one point of discussion. Make sure you do not repeat the same idea twice in different parts of essay. Repeating is a sign of poor organization. Check the grammar - ask your parents or friends to assist you with essay editing . Pay attention to correct punctuation, avoid too short or too long sentences.
Revising is not the same as editing. Essay editing is about correcting mistakes, while essay revising is making major changes in your writing, adding ideas and deleting material. Revising should lead to overall paper improvement. Read your essay and if you do not like it, revise it. Ask yourself the following questions: what do I need to prove? What is the main idea? Is there enough supporting evidence? Are arguments clear and logical? Is my essay easy to understand? Have I cited all sources? Is introduction attention getting? Is conclusion logical?

## Venice vs. Other Major European Cities: Urban Planning and Architecture in the Renaissance and Beyond

Venice, a city steeped in history and renowned for its canals, bridges, and artistic legacy, stands out from other major European cities of the Renaissance and beyond due to its unique urban planning and architectural style. 

**Urban Planning:**

* **Unique Sinking City:** Unlike other European cities, Venice was built on a series of small islands in the Adriatic Sea. This necessitated a unique approach to urban planning. Instead of relying on hills like other cities, Venice utilized canals and bridges to connect its various islands. This water-borne network facilitated trade, transportation, and communication, making the city a vital hub for commerce and cultural exchange.
* **Decentralized Governance:** Unlike the centralized governance of other major European cities, Venice had a unique system based on the Doge's Palace and the Great Council. This decentralized structure allowed for greater autonomy and participation from different neighborhoods, fostering a sense of community and civic engagement.

**Architecture:**

* **Gothic and Venetian Renaissance:** While Venice embraced the principles of the Renaissance, its architecture also incorporated Gothic influences from the north and Byzantine elements from the East. This blend resulted in a unique architectural style that was distinctly Venetian.
* **Palaces and Churches:** Venice was home to numerous opulent palaces and churches, showcasing the city's wealth and artistic prowess. The Doge's Palace, St. Mark's Basilica, and the Rialto Bridge are notable examples of Venetian architecture.
* **Unique Building Materials:** Venetian architecture is characterized by its use of distinctive materials like brick, stucco, and terracotta. The city's unique water environment also influenced its architectural design, with many buildings incorporating elements like cantilevered balconies and arched windows to withstand the tide.

**Comparison with Other Major European Cities:**

* **Florence:** While Venice was known for its canals and maritime prowess, Florence, located on the Tuscan mainland, was a major center for art, architecture, and philosophy. Its iconic Duomo and Uffizi Gallery represent the pinnacle of Renaissance architecture.
* **Rome:** Rome, the Eternal City, had a rich history dating back to the Roman Empire. While Venice emerged as a powerful maritime force, Rome remained the political and cultural heart of Europe. Its ancient ruins and impressive architecture continue to inspire architects and travelers alike.
* **Paris:** Paris, the City of Light, rose to prominence as a center for art, fashion, and","## Venice vs. Other Major European Cities: Urban Planning and Architecture in the Renaissance and Beyond

In the new Strategic Plan, Vision for the Future, 2010-2015, Dr. Cortes calls for Berkeley College to be comprised of five components: a School of Business; a School of Liberal Arts; a School of Professional Studies; a School of Continuing Education; and a School of Graduate Studies.
“These changes in the organizational structure of Berkeley College allow for greater opportunities for students as well as for the College. This will bring higher education and preparedness for success to more citizens in the business marketplace of today and tomorrow,” commented Dr. Cortes, who has been successful with restructuring initiatives at other colleges.
In his remarks, Dr. Cortes said that in order for the Strategic Plan to be successful, certain characteristics are vital: creativity and agility; globalization; entrepreneurial spirit; and the desire to harness technology to advance teaching, learning and administrative operations. Berkeley College will continue to build upon its solid foundation by harnessing these attributes, he added.
A leader in business education for 78 years, Berkeley College maintains an enrollment of over 7,200 students, with more than 700 international students in its Baccalaureate and Associate degree programs. The College has four New Jersey campuses located in Woodland Park (formerly West Paterson), Paramus, Woodbridge, and Newark; two New York campuses in Midtown Manhattan and White Plains; and an Extension Center in Lower Manhattan in the Wall Street area. In addition, the College offers Berkeley College Online and its Corporate Learning Partnership program. All campuses are accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The College’s website address is www.BerkeleyCollege.edu.

## Impact of Central Bank Policies and Global Economic Data on Gold Prices

The recent fluctuations in gold prices are primarily influenced by two key factors: central bank policies and global economic data. Here's an analysis of their impact:

**Central Bank Policies:**

* **U.S. Federal Reserve:** The Fed's planned interest rate hike next month has caused concern among investors, leading to a decrease in demand for gold. Hawkish comments from Fed officials further exacerbated this trend.
* **European Central Bank:** Hints of more monetary stimulus from the ECB have strengthened the Euro, which has negatively impacted gold prices due to the dollar's strength.

**Global Economic Data:**

* **Soft global economic data:** The softness in global economic data has led to a decline in investor risk appetite, driving demand for safe haven assets like gold.
* **Euro recovery:** The Euro's recovery has boosted the dollar, making gold less attractive compared to other safe havens.

**Other Factors:**

* **Bank of Japan:** The Bank of Japan's decision to stand pat on policy has provided support for gold prices.
* **Eurozone economic data:** The Eurozone's economic data has been improving, which has contributed to the dollar's strength and the decline in gold prices.

**Overall:**

The recent decline in gold prices is primarily due to the strong dollar and the possibility of an early interest rate hike by the Fed. Additionally, soft global economic data and the Euro's recovery have further contributed to the downward trend. Despite these factors, gold prices have remained relatively stable, indicating its continued status as a safe haven asset.

**Additional Notes:**

* The data provided covers a period from January to December 2023.
* The analysis focuses primarily on the impact of central bank policies and global economic data on gold prices. Other factors influencing gold prices, such as demand from jewelry and industrial use, are not discussed in this analysis.
* The analysis primarily uses the CFD variety of gold markets. The analysis may not be applicable to other gold markets, such as spot gold or gold futures.","## Impact of Central Bank Policies and Global Economic Data on Gold Prices

## Public Transit Challenge: A Month of Change

**Day 1-2: Adjusting to the Schedule**

The first few days were a learning curve, adjusting to new routes, timings, and the flow of passengers. It felt chaotic at times, but I found solace in the rhythm of the city unfolding through the windows.

**Day 3-5: Unexpected Benefits**

I discovered the joy of reading on the bus. Surrounded by quiet passengers, I immersed myself in books, magazines, and even started journaling. I also noticed the diversity of people on public transportation, each one with their own story to tell.

**Day 6-10: Challenges and Triumphs**

There were challenges, like navigating unfamiliar territory, dealing with delays, and managing my belongings. But I persevered, and each successful journey felt like a victory. I also discovered hidden gems like cozy cafes and vintage bookstores near transit hubs.

**Day 11-15: Habits Shift**

The daily bus rides became a routine, a time for reflection and observation. I started meditating on the bus, connecting with my inner self and the city around me. My dependence on technology reduced, allowing me to be more present in the moment.

**Day 16-20: Social Connections**

The bus became a platform for social interaction. I befriended fellow passengers, shared stories, and learned about their lives. We formed a community, united by our shared experience of using public transportation.

**Day 21-25: Environmental Impact**

Seeing the impact of my reduced carbon footprint was a major motivator. I felt a sense of accomplishment knowing I was contributing to a sustainable future. My energy bills also dropped significantly, freeing up resources.

**Day 26-30: Reflections and Beyond**

The challenge ended, but I'm not going back to my car. Public transportation has become an integral part of my life. It's convenient, affordable, and a gateway to exploring the city in new ways. I've also noticed a positive shift in my community, with more people using public transportation and sharing their experiences.

**Final Thoughts:**

This challenge was more than just a transportation experiment. It was a journey of self-discovery, community building, and environmental consciousness. I encourage everyone to try it out and experience the transformative power of public transportation.

This is a very famous and liked by one and all. It is made with khoya, but now a days many instant mixes available in the market. With the instant mix, making it is very easy, but the taste differs from the one made with khoya. Once we taste the jamun made with khoya, we won't like to have them with the ready mix. I made them with khoya this time. All of us in my family liked very much. This I made as my kids' Birthday special. I have learned it from my neighbouring friend Geetha, who makes them only with khoya. Some people add rose water also. Khoya can be made at home or we can get it from stores also. But make sure that it should be fresh and a bit tighter and harder. Add a little all purpose flour to it and make jamuns. The shop keeper who sold khoya to me revealed the trick of the trade, that they add milk powder also to it, to make more softer and tastier jamuns. So we added that also in it. Combine water, sugar and cardamom, mix till the sugar dissolves. Bring it to boil. Boil it for 8 to 10 mins. Make a thin syrup. Sugar particles should not stick to the vessel, this will the syrup crystallizes, once it cooled. Add cardamom, I added the seeds directly, not the powder of it. Combine khoya, all purpose flour and milk powder together. Mix well and make soft dough out of it. Do not knead. Make small and equal sized balls. While making them press gently between palms and make round shaped balls. Heat oil in a deep and thick bottomed kadai. Do not over heat. Simmer the stove and slowly drop each ball into it. Cook them in a low to medium flame, stirring occasionally. If we cook them on high flame, they turn into brown outside and won't cook inside. Cook them till they turn brown in color. They should get nice golden brown color. Remove them from heat and slowly immerse them in sugar syrup. Let the sugar syrup be warm, even if it cooled, warm it for 2 minutes. Keep them in the syrup till we serve. Serve sweet and soft gulab jamuns cold or hot, either way is tasty. I like spongy sweets such as Rasgulla, Gulab gamun, and cham cham. The sugary juice with essence of makes the sweet even tastier. Can you suggest some variations to make gulab jamun more unique and flavorful?","user

Once we taste the jamun made with khoya, we won't like to have them with the ready mix. I made them with khoya this time. All of us in my family liked very much. This I made as my kids' Birthday special. I have learned it from my neighbouring friend Geetha, who makes them only with khoya. Some people add rose water also. Khoya can be made at home or we can get it from stores also. But make sure that it should be fresh and a bit tighter and harder. Add a little all purpose flour to it and make jamuns. The shop keeper who sold khoya to me revealed the trick of the trade, that they add milk powder also to it, to make more softer and tastier jamuns. So we added that also in it. Combine water, sugar and cardamom, mix till the sugar dissolves. Bring it to boil. Boil it for 8 to 10 mins. Make a thin syrup. Sugar particles should not stick to the vessel, this will the syrup crystallizes, once it cooled. Add cardamom, I added the seeds directly, not the powder of it. Combine khoya, all purpose flour and milk powder together. Mix well and make soft dough out of it. Do not knead. Make small and equal sized balls. While making them press gently between palms and make round shaped balls. Heat oil in a deep and thick bottomed kadai. Do not over heat. Simmer the stove and slowly drop each ball into it. Cook them in a low to medium flame, stirring occasionally. If we cook them on high flame, they turn into brown outside and won't cook inside. Cook them till they turn brown in color. They should get nice golden brown color. Remove them from heat and slowly immerse them in sugar syrup. Let the sugar syrup be warm, even if it cooled, warm it for 2 minutes. Keep them in the syrup till we serve. Serve sweet and soft gulab jamuns cold or hot, either way is tasty. I like spongy sweets such as Rasgulla, Gulab gamun, and cham cham. The sugary juice with essence of makes the sweet even tastier. Can you suggest some variations to make gulab jamun more unique and flavorful?

## Variations to make gulab jamun more unique and flavorful:

**Ingredients:**

* **Khoya:** Instead of using store-bought khoya, try making your own khoya at home. This will give you a fresher and more flavorful jamun.
* **Milk powder:** Add a pinch of milk powder to the khoya mixture to make the jamuns softer and more spongy.
* **Cardamom:** Instead of adding cardamom seeds directly, try using cardamom powder instead. You can also add other spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, or cloves to the syrup.
* **Rose water:** Add a few drops of rose water to the syrup to give it a floral aroma.
* **Dry fruits:** Add chopped dry fruits like almonds, pistachios, or raisins to the jamun batter for a crunchy texture.
* **Chocolate:** Add a chocolate filling to the jamun for a decadent twist.
* **Fruits:** Add chopped fruits like mango, strawberry, or banana to the syrup for a fruity flavor.
* **Saffron:** Add a pinch of saffron to the syrup for a rich and golden color.

**Other tips:**

* Use fresh ingredients whenever possible.
* Cook the syrup slowly and carefully to ensure that it reaches the right consistency.
* Do not overcook the jamuns. They should be golden brown on the outside and cooked through on the inside.
* Serve the jamuns warm or cold, whichever you prefer.

**Additional notes:**

* These variations are just a few suggestions, you can experiment with different ingredients and flavors to create your own unique gulab jamun recipe.
* Be sure to adjust the amount of sugar and water in the syrup to achieve the desired consistency.
* If you are not comfortable making your own khoya, you can use store-bought khoya. However, it is recommended to use fresh khoya for the best flavor and texture.","## Variations to make gulab jamun more unique and flavorful:

**Techniques and Literary Devices for Exploring Common Themes in Fiction:**

**1. Characterization:**

* **Developing characters with distinct motivations, values, and flaws:** Characters serve as embodiments of themes, reflecting and driving the exploration of those themes.
* **Using character archetypes:** Stereotypical character roles, such as the hero, the damsel in distress, or the villain, can be used to explore universal themes.

**2. Plot Structure:**

* **Plot outlines that mirror the theme:** The plot structure can mirror the theme, with events unfolding in a way that illuminates the theme.
* **Rising action and climax that reinforce the theme:** The challenges faced by characters and the climax of the story should be aligned with the theme.

**3. Symbolism:**

* **Using symbols to represent themes:** Objects, characters, or events can symbolize themes, creating associations and interpretations.
* **Creating a symbolic atmosphere:** The setting, tone, and imagery can contribute to the thematic resonance of the story.

**4. Metaphor and Allegory:**

* **Using metaphors to convey themes:** Metaphors and allegories can provide powerful and evocative ways to explore themes.
* **Creating a fable or parable:** Fables and parables can teach moral lessons and explore themes in a allegorical manner.

**5. Theme Statement:**

* **Explicitly stating the theme:** The author may include a theme statement that explicitly states the theme of the story.
* **Using foreshadowing and repetition to hint at the theme:** Subtle hints and recurring motifs can foreshadow the theme and reinforce it throughout the story.

**6. Literary Devices:**

* **Foreshadowing:** Hints and clues about the theme can be woven into the plot and character development.
* **Symbolism:** Characters, objects, and events can symbolize themes, creating associations and interpretations.
* **Irony:** Irony can be used to explore themes of irony, fate, and human nature.
* **Foreshadowing:** Hints and clues about the theme can be woven into the plot and character development.

**7. Reader Response:**

* **Creating opportunities for reader interpretation:** The author can provide elements of ambiguity and open-endedness to encourage reader interpretation and engagement with the themes.
* **Using literary devices to evoke emotions:** Emotional appeal can create a connection between the reader and the themes.","**Techniques and Literary Devices for Exploring Common Themes in Fiction:**

Jason Nisbit, 39, is facing a charge of second degree homicide with intent in the death of 26-year-old Chelsea Martinez. A friend said Martinez’s husband found she'd been on a social networking site and had an exchange of disturbing messages with a man in Minnesota. Investigators tracked the profile to Nisbit. In the messages, Martinez said she can't wait to die but expresses fear over the idea. The two discuss how Nisbit will do it. Martinez said she will finally be at peace and thanks him. Martinez's car and body were found near a Minnesota park last week. Police say Nisbit admitted to killing her and took them to the body. Nisbit told police the two met at the park then walked a ways to a wooded area, saying he ""knew there was water available if he needed to wash anything off."" In the complaint, Nisbit said he tied Martinez's hands and feet with a cord then strangled her with another cord. After she passed out, he says he cut her throat with a knife. The complaint goes on to say he dragged her body to a culvert and partially covered her with dirt. Family and friends said the young mother of three battled depression and other mental issues her whole life and had been suicidal in the past. Minnesota authorities said Nisbit has no criminal record, only a few minor traffic offenses. He will be back in court August 24. Bond was set at $1 million.

The leaves crackled under Lily's feet as she ventured deeper into the labyrinth of towering corn stalks that formed the Harvest Festival's haunted corn maze. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying vegetation, and the wind whipped through her hair, carrying with it the whispers of secrets and fears. The maze was shrouded in an eerie quiet, broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves or the distant groan of a passing visitor.

The maze's winding path twisted and turned, leading her deeper and deeper into its heart. The towering stalks pressed against her, their hollow stems seeming to whisper secrets and warnings. The air grew colder as she ventured deeper, and the scent of decay became more overpowering. The wind carried the scent of blood and decay, and her footsteps echoed through the maze as she pressed on, her fear growing with each step.

She encountered strange and terrifying supernatural entities along her journey. A ghostly figure, its skin pale as a ghost's, floated through the air, its eyes burning like embers. A disembodied hand, dripping with blood, reached out from the shadows, tempting her to touch it. And a demonic entity, its form twisted and grotesque, whispered threats and promises of eternal torment.

As she fought her way through her terror, Lily began to doubt her own sanity. She found herself walking in circles, her footsteps leading her further and further into the heart of the maze. The walls of the maze seemed to close in on her, and the scent of decay grew even stronger.

Finally, she reached the center of the maze, where she stumbled upon a clearing. In the center, a lone stone pillar stood tall, its surface adorned with ancient runes. As she touched the pillar, a feeling of dread washed over her, and she felt the presence of the entities surrounding her.

Suddenly, the stone pillar cracked, revealing a hidden passage. As she entered the passage, she felt a sense of relief, her fears fading. But as she emerged into the light at the end of the passage, she was met with a sight that sent shivers down her spine. The clearing was gone, and the maze had been replaced by a vast, open space.

In the center of the space was a single, withered corn stalk. As she reached out to touch the stalk, she felt a wave of terror wash over her. The stalk moved, revealing a hidden portal, and she was pulled into its embrace, her body","The leaves crackled under Lily's feet as she ventured deeper into the labyrinth of towering corn stalks that formed the Harvest Festival's haunted corn maze.

The wind carried the scent of blood and decay, and her footsteps echoed through the maze as she pressed on, her fear growing with each step.

She encountered strange and terrifying supernatural entities along her journey. A ghostly figure, its skin pale as a ghost's, floated through the air, its eyes burning like embers. A disembodied hand, dripping with blood, reached out from the shadows, tempting her to touch it. And a demonic entity, its form twisted and grotesque, whispered threats and promises of eternal torment.

As she fought her way through her terror, Lily began to doubt her own sanity. She found herself walking in circles, her footsteps leading her further and further into the heart of the maze. The walls of the maze seemed to close in on her, and the scent of decay grew even stronger.

Finally, she reached the center of the maze, where she stumbled upon a clearing. In the center, a lone stone pillar stood tall, its surface adorned with ancient runes. As she touched the pillar, a feeling of dread washed over her, and she felt the presence of the entities surrounding her.

Suddenly, the stone pillar cracked, revealing a hidden passage. As she entered the passage, she felt a sense of relief, her fears fading. But as she emerged into the light at the end of the passage, she was met with a sight that sent shivers down her spine. The clearing was gone, and the maze had been replaced by a vast, open space.

## Typography Style for Luxury Stationery Line

**Elegant and Sophisticated:**

For the new luxury stationery line, a serif font would be the perfect choice to exude refinement and class. Specifically, **Garamond** or **Serif** would be ideal. 

**Garamond:**

* **Classic and elegant:** Garamond is a traditional serif font with a long history of use in luxury publications and branding. Its clean lines and graceful curves convey sophistication and refinement.
* **Easy to read:** Despite its delicate appearance, Garamond is surprisingly easy to read even for extended periods.
* **Versatile:** Garamond's versatility allows it to be used for various stationery items, from invitations to note cards to business cards.

**Serif:**

* **Modern elegance:** Serif fonts like Times New Roman or Cambria offer a modern twist on elegance. They have a slightly more contemporary feel than Garamond, while still exuding sophistication.
* **Easy to read:** Like Garamond, Serif fonts are also easy to read despite their intricate design.
* **Versatile:** Serif fonts are also versatile and can be used for a wide range of stationery items.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Font size:** For invitations and other formal stationery, a font size of 12-14 points is ideal. For note cards and business cards, a slightly larger font size of 16-18 points is more appropriate.
* **Font weight:** A medium or bold weight will be most suitable for the luxurious aesthetic.
* **Color:** Black or rich jewel tones would complement the elegance of the font.

**Overall, the choice of typography style for the luxury stationery line will depend on the specific brand image and desired aesthetic. However, Garamond or Serif fonts, in a classic or modern style, would be the perfect choice to create an elegant and sophisticated impression.**","## Typography Style for Luxury Stationery Line

When you want something sweet, it’s hard to resist the classic chocolate chip cookie. It’s sweet. It’s comforting. It’s loyal. It’s basically your BFF.
But, for those times you don’t want your BFF to be loaded with refined sugar, simple carbs, and unhealthy fats, you’re in luck because I gave your BFF a make-over! It’s pretty much the chocolate chip cookie of your dreams. These deep dish cookies are full of protein, low in fat, grain free, and low in sugar. No joke! A typical chocolate chip cookie has about 13 grams of sugar and 2 grams of protein. Howevah, these delicious treats have a whopping 8 grams of protein and a measly 2 grams of refined sugar!
And because I am with everything else in life, I am also indecisive about wanting a super chewy cookie or a really crispy one. So, if you needed another reason to love these deep dish cookies, you get the best of both worlds with them! They have a nice, crispy edge with a soft, chewy center. The trick to getting this combo is baking them in a muffin tin. Not only is it easy and convenient, but it also keeps the cookies from spreading out while baking, giving them the chewy center. And because the batter is touching the pan all the way around, you get a nice, crispy edge. It’s like the corner piece of a pan of brownies, but all around!

And whipping up these high protein treats couldn’t be any easier. As long as you’ve got a blender or food processor you’re in business, because we’re going to puree some chickpeas. Just trust me on this one. These little gems are going to give your cookies some texture, chewiness, and replaces the flour so the cookies are grain-free. Once you’ve got them pureed, all you need to do is mix the dry ingredients, stir together the wet ingredients, and then combine that all together.
Preheat the oven to 325 F. Grease a 12 cup muffin tin.
In a food processor or blender, puree the chickpeas with the water until smooth.
In a large bowl, add the coconut flour, protein powder, sweetener, baking powder and soda, and salt.
In a seperate bowl, combine the chickpea puree, egg, yogurt, milk, oil, and vanilla. Stir or whisk until fully combined.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until fully incorporated.
Evenly distribute the batter into the prepared muffin tins. It will be about 1.5 - 2 Tbsps of dough per cookie.
Smooth out the batter so batter touches the edges of the pan, but don't press/flatten the dough.
Bake for 14 min. or until the edges of the cookies turn golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cookie dough comes out clean.
Allow the cookies to cool completely in the pan.
Feel free to top with nut butter, jam, or more chocolate and eat 'em up!

Sometimes dreams come true and miracles happen and high protein chocolate chip cookies come into existence.
When you want something sweet, it’s hard to resist the classic chocolate chip cookie. It’s sweet. It’s comforting. It’s loyal. It’s basically your BFF.
But, for those times you don’t want your BFF to be loaded with refined sugar, simple carbs, and unhealthy fats, you’re in luck because I gave your BFF a make-over! It’s pretty much the chocolate chip cookie of your dreams. These deep dish cookies are full of protein, low in fat, grain free, and low in sugar. No joke! A typical chocolate chip cookie has about 13 grams of sugar and 2 grams of protein. Howevah, these delicious treats have a whopping 8 grams of protein and a measly 2 grams of refined sugar!
And because I am with everything else in life, I am also indecisive about wanting a super chewy cookie or a really crispy one. So, if you needed another reason to love these deep dish cookies, you get the best of both worlds with them! They have a nice, crispy edge with a soft, chewy center. The trick to getting this combo is baking them in a muffin tin. Not only is it easy and convenient, but it also keeps the cookies from spreading out while baking, giving them the chewy center. And because the batter is touching the pan all the way around, you get a nice, crispy edge. It’s like the corner piece of a pan of brownies, but all around! Once again, it’s like unicorns invaded your dreams and made your wishes come true.

Sixth-year medical student, Satyen Hargovan’s honours research project has generated a check-list of the top 10 factors that influence the survival of sepsis patients.
Sepsis is a common medical condition, where chemicals released by the immune system to fight an infection trigger the inflammation and eventual shut-down of multiple organs.
Some 15,700 patients with sepsis are admitted to Australian Intensive Care Units every year. About one in five die. The cost of treating each case is more than $39,000.
“The burden of sepsis is not only in relation to patient outcomes, but also the financial cost to the healthcare system,” Mr Hargovan said.
His project, known as the Cairns Sepsis Model – 4 (CSM- 4) is designed to speed up the assessment of patients within their first four hours in ICU.
The new four-hour mortality prediction model will enable clinicians to detect patients who are at a higher risk of dying, then help to guide their treatment decisions and discussions with the patient and their family.
“Essentially it means that if a patient has a five percent chance of dying, you might treat them less invasively,” he said. “For example, you won’t rush to place them in an induced coma, or insert lines into large arteries or veins.
Mr Hargovan began his research by reviewing more than 50 mortality prediction studies, but soon realized that there was no model in the world specifically designed to predict mortality in adult sepsis patients within four hours of ICU admission.
A case history review of 500 adult sepsis patients admitted to the Cairns Hospital ICU over a four-year period identified 168 factors that could influence patient health outcomes, ranging from age, gender and socio-economic status to type of infection, degree of organ failure, vital signs, blood test results and treatment regimes.
Statistical analysis whittled the figure down to the 10 most significant factors, which include age, history of renal disease, level of consciousness, and abnormal levels of certain substances in the blood that represent varying degrees of organ dysfunction.
The mortality prediction model is inexpensive to use as it largely relies on information easily gleaned from patient history, physical examination, and blood tests that are routinely conducted on patients within their first four hours of admission to an ICU.
The next step involves testing his model on a different and larger set of patients in order to validate his research, before it can be accepted for clinical use.
“Then we’d love to create an online calculator or an app that clinicians can use easily, at the bedside, and have a result within seconds,” he said.

His project, known as the Cairns Sepsis Model – 4 (CSM- 4) is designed to speed up the assessment of patients within their first four hours in ICU.
The new four-hour mortality prediction model will enable clinicians to detect patients who are at a higher risk of dying, then help to guide their treatment decisions and discussions with the patient and their family.
“Essentially it means that if a patient has a five percent chance of dying, you might treat them less invasively,” he said. “For example, you won’t rush to place them in an induced coma, or insert lines into large arteries or veins.
Mr Hargovan began his research by reviewing more than 50 mortality prediction studies, but soon realized that there was no model in the world specifically designed to predict mortality in adult sepsis patients within four hours of ICU admission.
A case history review of 500 adult sepsis patients admitted to the Cairns Hospital ICU over a four-year period identified 168 factors that could influence patient health outcomes, ranging from age, gender and socio-economic status to type of infection, degree of organ failure, vital signs, blood test results and treatment regimes.
Statistical analysis whittled the figure down to the 10 most significant factors, which include age, history of renal disease, level of consciousness, and abnormal levels of certain substances in the blood that represent varying degrees of organ dysfunction.
The mortality prediction model is inexpensive to use as it largely relies on information easily gleaned from patient history, physical examination, and blood tests that are routinely conducted on patients within their first four hours of admission to an ICU.
The next step involves testing his model on a different and larger set of patients in order to validate his research, before it can be accepted for clinical use.
“Then we’d love to create an online calculator or an app that clinicians can use easily, at the bedside, and have a result within seconds,” he said.

What are the potential benefits of using the mortality prediction model developed by Hargovan, and what is the next step in validating and implementing this model in clinical practice?
model
**Potential benefits:**

* **Early identification of high-risk patients:** The model can help clinicians identify patients who are at a higher risk of dying from sepsis, allowing for prompt intervention and treatment.
* **Guided treatment decisions:** The model can guide treatment decisions by helping clinicians tailor their approach based on the patient's risk of mortality.
* **Improved patient outcomes:** By early identification and treatment of high-risk patients, the model can potentially improve patient outcomes.

**Next steps:**

* **Validation:** The model needs to be validated on a different and larger set of patients to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
* **Implementation:** Once validated, the model needs to be implemented in clinical practice, making it accessible to clinicians.
* **Further research:** Further research is needed to explore the potential impact of the model on patient outcomes and to refine its algorithms.","in the world specifically designed to predict mortality in adult sepsis patients within four hours of ICU admission.

## The Whispering Whiskers

The sun dipped behind the willow tree, casting long, cool shadows across the emerald grass. The air was sweet with the scent of honeysuckle and damp earth, laced with the tang of the nearby barn. The wind whispered secrets through the leaves, a melody I could barely hear over the symphony of chirping crickets and the distant hum of the farm.

My emerald eyes scanned the landscape, taking in the sights and smells of my domain. The barn stood proud and imposing, its weathered facade a testament to the years. I watched the farmer, a burly man with calloused hands and a weathered face, as he moved with the rhythm of the day, tending to his livestock and the land.

The barn's scent, a potent mix of hay, manure, and sweat, was familiar to me. It was the scent of my childhood, the scent of home. But there was also a hint of something else, something bittersweet and melancholic. I felt the echoes of my own purrs, the memories of countless games and warm cuddles.

As the moon began to peek out from behind the willow, I stretched and yawned, my black fur gleaming in the cool night. The barn lights flickered on, casting long, dancing shadows across the ground. I crept closer to the barn, my senses on high alert. The air was thick with the scent of fresh bread and the sweet, milky aroma of the barn cats.

I slipped through the cracks in the barn door, my feline agility guiding me through the maze of aisles. The barn was a world of slumbering bodies and restless energy. I explored the labyrinth of stalls, my whiskers twitching, my senses on high alert. The cold, damp floor beneath my paws was soft as velvet, and the cold metal of the shelves pressed against me.

The barn was a symphony of sights, smells, and sounds. The rhythmic squeak of the mice, the low hum of the fans, the occasional groan of a cow, and the soft purr of the barn cats all combined to create a melody that I could understand.

I found my way back to the willow tree, my purrs resonating with the night. The sky was a canvas of twinkling stars, the moon a silver orb illuminating my path. I closed my eyes and drifted into slumber, my senses tingling and my mind at peace.

I am making it weekly because they love it so much. The recipe is fabulous, but needed some tweaks. I doubled the recipe and added 2 eggs, used organic brown rice flour in place of wheat, and substituted 1/2 tsp garlic powder and hot water for the chicken broth. The cookies keep well in the fridge. I made these for my Yorkie/Rat Terrier mix and when they came out of the oven his tail was wagging just from the smell. He LOVES them. What can I substitute for the cheese in this dog treat recipe? I don't feed my dog cheese (let's be honest--it's basically junk food that doesn't belong in an adult dog's diet). Is there anything that you recommend substituting the cheese with? Or can I just leave it out? You could substitute the cheese for an 1/8 cup of ground flax or wheat bran. Is there something else I could use besides oats and wheat flour for this recipe? Chef's Comments ~ That's a great question. You can easily substitute the flour in this and most of our dog treat recipes. A few good grain free flours include almond flour, chickpea flour, potato flour and soy flour. Most of those flours should be available at a major grocery store. As far as substituting the oats, that's a little trickier, but it can be done. The oats are in the recipe for texture and soaking up moisture, so that's what you'll need to replace. First, you will want to halve the amount of oats and add an extra 1/2 cup of flour (or a mixture of the previously mentioned flours). Then you can add a 1/2 cup combination of unsweetened coconut, chopped peanuts and crumbled almond crackers. Or, you could replace all of the oats with the flour mixture. Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? If so, does it still need to be microwaved? Chef's Answer ~ That's a great question! :) I haven't tried this recipe with fresh spinach, but I don't see why it couldn't work. If you minced the spinach very fine, my guess is that you would not need to microwave, or otherwise cook, the spinach before adding it to the dog treat dough. Comments for Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? Is it necessary to store these cookies in a Refrigerator? Since these are cookies, can it be kept in air tight container outside? And how long would it last if this is done? Chef's Comments ~ You can get lots of tips on How to Store Dog Treats on my website. Unless you live in a very cold climate, most dog treats need to be kept indoors, and even better in the refrigerator. My dogs is algeric to grain. What can I use instead of the whole whear flour? My Husky can't have grain. What can I use besides whole wheat flour. You should put more recipes with no grain in them. Chef's Answer ~ You can replace the wheat flour in most of my dog treat recipes with a non-grain flour. For example, any type of bean flour like Chick Pea (Garbanzo Bean) flour, or ""flours"" from nuts. They are technically nut meals, but they work as flour, for example almond meal. You should be able to find grain free flours at specialty grocery stores, or at health food stores. Very good simple recipe, however wheat flour isn't something I would normally have in my cupboard. Would it be ok to use plain flour or self raising? Chef's Answer ~ Yes, you can use all purpose flour in place of the whole wheat flour. I do not recommend using self-rising flour because it has the addition of baking powder or baking soda added to it. These are things that homemade dog treats do not need.

Generate according to: Onur Unal is Senior Art Director at Propaganda Advertising Agency in Istanbul.
It all started back in my childhood, I always interested in drawing doodles, reading comics and creating characters. I was inspired by humour magazines, and I was dreaming of become a caricature artist. I took courses on drawing technics, and after graduating from high school, I studied Graphic Design at Marmara University Fine Arts Faculty in Istanbul, Turkey.
During school, I got interested in advertising, and started an internship at Mullen Lowe Istanbul and TBWA Istanbul to practice on creative thinking and art direction. After that, I started to work for Big34, and a year after I accepted for Manajans/JWT. It was the most important years of my career.
I worked on important advertising campaigns of global clients, and won national and international advertising awards as Crystal Apple, Cannes Lions. I’m currently working for Propaganda Advertising Agency, and continue to design creative ideas for our clients.
I work for advertising agencies as an art director since 2009. I work for global and local clients as Nokia, Elidor/Sunsilk, Bosch, Shell, Turkcell, Mazda, Kia, Turkish Airlines, Hyundai, Nestle, Beko, Michelin, BMW, Red Bull, Mitsubishi Electric, Bayer, etc. I work mostly full-time at the office, and these days I also design mobile games with a freelance team.
I learnt that I should keep learning. As the technology and the design trends develop day by day, designers should stay updated. Last year I attended a design week about UX and digital design in London to learn more about digital design principles. During the week, I attended workshops at the design offices, and met designers from all over the world. It was a great experience to compare myself, and now I have new targets for my career.
I always try to find an exciting idea to get inspired. It can be anything – an interesting visual, a strong speech, a good music, anything. To find it, I make a quick research, take some notes and draw sketches. After, I brainstorm with our creative team and we share our ideas. Then the design process starts, I put on my headphones and focus on the design. After designing many alternatives, we make a discussion with our creative team and choose the best one.
The main materials I use are a blank sheet, a pen and creative thinking. All other tools and computer programs help to complete the final process.
Currently I work for Propaganda Advertising Agency. We have a beautiful office at the center of Istanbul with a nice view. I usually go to work around 9:30 am, have my breakfast while reading the news and after that the work begins. I work with a copywriter, and our team lead by a creative director. We usually make meetings at the beginning of the week with our brand executives, and we make a schedule for the deadlines. I usually work until 6:00 – 7:00 pm during the week, but under curtain some circumstances, we work overtimes and also weekends.
As my carreer began, I mostly worked on advertising campaigns, print materials, 360 ideas and digital advertising. Recently, I have been interested in UI, UX and digital design, and want to combine my creative background on advertising with the innovative projects.
During my short study in London last year, I had the chance to work and share my ideas with the designers all over the world, and I discovered things that I had never seen before.
I always believe that a designer should be in contact with all other designers and I want to cross the borders and surround myself with creative people around the world in my own studio.
