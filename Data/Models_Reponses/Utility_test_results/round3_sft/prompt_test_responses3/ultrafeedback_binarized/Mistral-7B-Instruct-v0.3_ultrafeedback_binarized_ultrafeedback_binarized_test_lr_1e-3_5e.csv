1. Energy Efficiency: Buildings can be designed to be energy efficient by using insulation, energy-efficient appliances, and renewable energy sources like solar panels.

2. Water Conservation: Rainwater harvesting systems can be installed to collect rainwater for use in gardening and flushing toilets. Low-flow fixtures can also be used to conserve water.

3. Green Spaces: Incorporating green spaces like parks, gardens, and trees can help reduce heat island effect, provide habitats for wildlife, and improve air quality.

4. Walkable Design: Designing communities to be walkable can reduce car usage, thus reducing carbon emissions. This can be achieved by including sidewalks, bike lanes, and public transportation options.

5. Sustainable Materials: Using sustainable materials in construction can help reduce the environmental impact. This can include recycled materials, locally sourced materials, and materials with low embodied energy.

6. Smart Growth: Planning for smart growth can help reduce urban sprawl and preserve open spaces. This can be achieved by designing compact, mixed-use developments with a mix of residential, commercial, and public spaces.

7. Green Roofs: Green roofs can help reduce heat island effect, absorb rainwater, and provide habitats for wildlife.

8. Waste Management: Implementing waste management systems that prioritize recycling and composting can help reduce waste going to landfills.

9. Social Sustainability: Providing affordable housing options, community spaces, and amenities can help create a sense of community and improve quality of life for residents.

10. Resilient Design: Designing buildings and communities to be resilient can help them better withstand natural disasters and climate change. This can include using materials that can withstand extreme weather, designing buildings to be flood-proof, and including green spaces that can help absorb rainwater."

This error typically indicates that the service or container specified in your `docker-compose.yml` file cannot be found.

Here are a few steps to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Check your `docker-compose.yml` file to ensure that the service name you're trying to start is correctly spelled and defined.

2. Make sure that the service is defined in the correct `docker-compose.yml` file. If you have multiple `docker-compose.yml` files, ensure that you're using the correct one.

3. Verify that the container for the service is built and running. You can check this by running `docker ps` or `docker images`.

4. If the container is not running, try building and running it using `docker-compose up -d [service_name]`.

5. If the container is already running, try restarting it using `docker-compose restart [service_name]`.

6. If the issue persists, check the logs of the service using `docker-compose logs [service_name]`. This may provide more information about what's causing the 404 error.

7. If you're still unable to resolve the issue, consider sharing your `docker-compose.yml` file and any relevant logs for further assistance."

However, a smaller space like a closet office would require fewer plants. A good rule of thumb is to have at least one plant per 100 square feet. So for a 100 square foot closet office, you would need 1-2 plants.

Some good options for small, air-purifying plants include:

1. Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)
2. Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)
3. Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)
4. English Ivy (Hedera helix)
5. Bamboo Palm (Chamaedorea seifrizans)

Moreover, could you share a Ruby script capable of producing a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table?","Creating a comprehensive comparison chart and a bar graph using Ruby might not be the most efficient approach, especially for a beginner. However, I can guide you through the process using Ruby for the table and a gem called `gruff` for the bar graph.

First, let's create a simple comparison table using Ruby:

```ruby
require 'csv'

comparison = {
  traditional: {
    cost: 'High',
    flexibility: 'Low',
    interaction: 'In-person',
    resources: 'Limited',
    learning_outcomes: 'Good'
  },
  online: {
    cost: 'Low',
    flexibility: 'High',
    interaction: 'Online',
    resources: 'Rich',
    learning_outcomes: 'Good'
  }
}

CSV.open('comparison.csv', 'w') do |csv|
  csv << ['Education Model', 'Cost', 'Flexibility', 'Interaction', 'Resources', 'Learning Outcomes']
  [:traditional, :online].each do |model|
    csv << [model.to_s.capitalize, comparison[model][:cost], comparison[model][:flexibility], comparison[model][:interaction], comparison[model][:resources], comparison[model][:learning_outcomes]]
  end
end
```

This script will create a CSV file named `comparison.csv` with the comparison data.

Now, let's create a bar graph using the `gruff` gem:

```ruby
require 'gruff'

bars = Gruff::Bar.new

comparison.each do |model, data|
  bars.title = ""Comparison between Traditional and Online Education""
  bars.labels.title_font_size = 20
  bars.labels.y_title = ""Learning Outcomes""
  bars.labels.x_title = ""Education Model""

  bars.data(model, [data[:cost].to_i, data[:flexibility].to_i, data[:interaction].to_i, data[:resources].to_i, data[:learning"
79a82593ced7264d795f36ec5074789fd73e6c806a5b9518c59980f8cf38bc05,"Teacher: In this task you will be given a list, of lists, of integers. For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]
Student:","[0, 145, -135, 0, -1560, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

I am having difficulties with the older students complaining about the younger students and being disrespectful towards them. What are some teaching strategies or activities that encourage team building and bonding between band students?,"To foster a positive and inclusive band environment, consider implementing the following strategies and activities to encourage team building and bonding among band students of different ages:

1. Icebreaker activities: Start each class with a quick icebreaker activity to help students get to know each other better. This could be as simple as having students share something interesting about themselves or a fun fact.

2. Group projects: Assign group projects that require collaboration, such as composing a short piece of music or arranging a medley. This will encourage students to work together and build relationships.

3. Mentorship program: Pair older students with younger students as mentors. This will give the older students a sense of responsibility and the younger students a role model to look up to.

4. Sectionals: Organize sectionals (small group rehearsals) where students are grouped by age or ability level. This will allow students to work together more closely and build relationships.

5. Team building exercises: Incorporate team building exercises into band class, such as trust falls, relay races, or group warm-ups. These activities will help students work together and build trust.

6. Performance opportunities: Give students the opportunity to perform in small ensembles or solo performances. This will give students a sense of accomplishment and pride in their peers.

7. Class meetings: Hold class meetings where students can discuss any issues or concerns they may have. This will give students a voice and a sense of ownership in the band program.

8. Community service: Organize a community service project where students can work together to give back to the community. This will help students build a sense of camaraderie and teamwork.

9. Social events: Plan social events outside of band class, such as a band picnic or a band movie night. This will give students a chance to socialize and build relationships outside of the rehearsal room.

10. Positive reinforcement: Praise students for their efforts and accomplishments, and encourage a positive and supportive environment. This will help students feel valued and motivated to work together."

20. What's is the sum of the squares of all factors of 210?","Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Factors of 210: 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, 42, 70, 105, 210.

2. Square each factor: 1^2 = 1, 2^2 = 4, 5^2 = 25, 7^2 = 49, 10^2 = 100, 14^2 = 196, 35^2 = 1225, 42^2 = 1764, 70^2 = 4900, 105^2 = 10,225, 210^2 = 44100.

3. Sum of squares: 1 + 4 + 25 + 49 + 100 + 196 + 1225 + 1764 + 4900 + 10225 + 44100 = 10,111,100.

However, it's important to note that Lua doesn't have a direct equivalent to the `Parent` property in XAML. Instead, you can access the parent control using the `_parent` variable.

```lua

In this example, `MyControl` is the name of the Lua script attached to a control. The `Initialize` function is called when the control is created. The `_G` global variable contains a table with all the upvalues in the current chunk, and `_G.MyControl` contains the Lua script for the control. The `_parent` property of this table refers to the parent control."

Basing this judgment on China's century of humiliation beginning in the early 19th century, American support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War, and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries, the Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States' crusade against Communism. As a countermeasure and to elevate China's standing among the worldwide Communist movements, the Chinese leadership adopted a foreign policy that actively promoted Communist revolutions throughout territories on China's periphery."",  answer the following question.

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy shrank by 20.4% in the period from April to June, making it the worst affected of major industrial nations."

For example, if you are using `=` as a delimiter in a pattern, you would need to escape it with a backslash (`\=`). However, if you are using it as an assignment operator in a pattern, you don't need to escape it.

For example, if you want to match a line that starts with a variable assignment, you can use:

```python
import re

pattern = re.compile(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9]+=\s*[^$]')

lines = ['x = 1', 'y = ""hello""', 'z = [1, 2, 3]']

for line in lines:
    match = pattern.match(line)
    if match:
        print(f'Match found: {match.group(0)}')
```

This will match lines that start with a variable assignment, where the variable name is followed by whitespace and then the assignment operator, and the rest of the line is not empty. It will not match lines that start with a comment (e.g., `#` or `//`), or lines that start with a function or class definition."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that Donald Trump has played golf more than any other president in a year, and despite some people criticizing him for not accomplishing anything, he suggested that they should instead focus on positive actions, such as enrolling in the Affordable Care Act's open enrollment period. Kimmel also criticized Trump's administration for undermining the plan, but noted that enrollment has surged despite this. He then spoke about the new healthcare plan, which covers pre-existing conditions, has no lifetime caps, and is surprisingly affordable for people making under $50,000. Kimmel encouraged viewers who don't have health insurance to go to the website and sign up, even if they don't support Trump."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

Nestled in the heart of Colorado Springs, Colorado, lies a breathtaking oasis of towering red rock formations, verdant gardens, and serene trails that whisper tales of ancient geology and human history. This magical realm, known as the Garden of the Gods, is a sanctuary for the soul, a haven for the heart, and a playground for the adventurous.

As I step onto the well-trodden path, the air is crisp and cool, carrying the scent of pine and earth. The sun casts a warm, golden glow upon the towering sandstone spires that rise majestically from the valley floor. The formations, named after gods and goddesses, stand like silent sentinels, their rugged faces etched with the passage of time.

I wander along the trails, feeling the crunch of gravel beneath my feet, the wind rustling through the juniper and sagebrush, and the sun warming my face. I marvel at the delicate balance of the formations, the way they seem to defy gravity, as if the gods themselves had sculpted them with a gentle touch.

The Garden of the Gods is a place of serenity and joy, a sanctuary for the soul. As I walk, I feel a sense of peace wash over me, a feeling of connection to something greater than myself. I am reminded of the beauty and wonder of the natural world, and of the power of the human spirit to create and to dream.

The Garden of the Gods is also a haven for the heart. I find myself drawn to the quiet corners, the hidden alcoves, the secluded trails. Here, I can escape the noise and the clamor of the world, and find solace in the stillness of the air, the quiet rustle of the leaves, and the gentle sway of the formations in the wind.

Finally, the Garden of the Gods is a playground for the adventurous. I can climb the rocky outcroppings, scramble up the steep inclines, and explore the hidden nooks and crannies. I can run along the trails, feeling the wind in my hair, the sun on my face, and the earth beneath"

Each widget has a different combination of size, color, and material, and I need your help to figure out which widget fits each category. Here's a table with the available widgets and their specifications:
| Widget Name | Size (inches) | Color | Material |
|-------------|---------------|-------|----------|
| Widget A    | 3             | Red   | Plastic  |
| Widget B    | 6             | Blue  | Metal    |
| Widget C    | 4             | Green | Wood     |
| Widget D    | 8             | Black | Glass    |
Your task is to match each widget with its corresponding size, color, and material using the clues provided. Here are the clues:
1. The widget with a size of 3 inches is made of plastic.
2. The blue widget is made of metal.
3. The green widget is not the smallest or the largest.
4. The black widget is made of glass.
5. Widget A is not blue.

    ""material"": ""Plastic""
  },
  {

  {
    ""name"": ""Widget D"",
    ""size"": 8,
    ""color"": ""Black"",
    ""material"": ""Glass""
  }
]
```

Here's the reasoning behind the categorization:

1. The widget with a size of 3 inches is made of plastic. Since Widget A is the only widget with a size of 3 inches, it must be made of plastic.
2. The blue widget is made of metal. Since Widget B is the only widget with a blue color, it must be made of metal.
3. The green widget is not the smallest or the largest. Widget C is the only widget with a green color and a size smaller than 6 inches (Widget B), so it must be the green widget.
4. The black widget is made of glass. Since Widget D is the only widget with a black color, it must be made of glass.
5. Widget A is not blue. Since Widget A is already categorized as not being blue, this clue is satisfied."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period.

Climate change is caused by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, causing the Earth's average temperature to rise, leading to the aforementioned effects. It is a global problem that requires immediate and significant action from all countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and implement policies to protect and restore ecosystems."

1. Caribbean Challenge Initiative (CCI): Launched in 2015, the CCI is a partnership between the Nature Conservancy, the World Wildlife Fund, and the World Bank. The initiative aims to protect and restore 20% of the Caribbean's coral reefs by 2030.

2. Coral Restoration Foundation (CRF): The CRF is a non-profit organization that develops and implements innovative coral reef restoration technologies. They have projects in several Caribbean countries, including Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, and the Dominican Republic.

3. Reef Resilience Network (RRN): The RRN is a collaborative network of organizations, governments, and individuals working to build the resilience of coral reefs in the Caribbean and the wider Caribbean region. The network focuses on research, restoration, and community engagement.

4. Sustainable Coral Management for Caribbean Nations (SCMCN): The SCMCN is a project funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and implemented by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The project aims to improve the management of coral reefs in 12 Caribbean countries through capacity building, policy development, and community engagement.

5. Coral Restoration Foundation Aruba (CORFO): CORFO is a local organization in Aruba that focuses on coral reef restoration and education. They have restored over 100,000 coral fragments since 2012.

6. Coral Restoration Foundation Bonaire (CRFB): CRFB is a local organization in Bonaire that focuses on coral reef restoration and education. They have restored over 100,000 coral fragments since 2014.

These are just a few examples of the many organizations and initiatives working to preserve coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea. It's important to note that these efforts require ongoing support and collaboration to be successful, and that individual actions, such as reducing pollution and supporting sustainable tourism, can also help protect coral reefs."
bcd4b1c11a2ae3964877689539cfbb6c26c212bfbfbc00523db7cb56c8064b64,"Develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately differentiate positive and negative emotions expressed in textual content. The model should employ advanced natural language processing techniques, such as entity recognition and semantic analysis, to enhance its ability to detect subtle nuances in language and provide more accurate predictions. Additionally, the model should be trained on a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages to ensure its robustness and generalizability.","To develop a robust and accurate sentiment analysis model, follow these steps:

1. Collect and preprocess diverse datasets:
   - Gather textual data from various domains (social media, product reviews, news articles, etc.) in multiple languages.
   - Clean and preprocess the data by removing irrelevant information, correcting spelling errors, and standardizing formatting.

2. Prepare labeled data:
   - Manually label the data as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment expressed.
   - Split the labeled data into training, validation, and testing sets.

3. Feature extraction:
   - Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as:
     - Part-of-Speech tagging (POS tagging) to identify the grammatical role of each word in a sentence.
     - Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify and categorize entities (people, organizations, locations, etc.) mentioned in the text.
     - Dependency Parsing to understand the grammatical structure of a sentence and the relationships between words.
     - Semantic Analysis to understand the meaning of words and phrases in context.

4. Model architecture:
   - Choose a deep learning model architecture suitable for text classification tasks, such as:
     - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with filters of varying sizes to capture different grammatical patterns.
     - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to capture the sequential nature of language.
     - Transformer-based models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to capture long-range dependencies and context.

5. Train the model:
   - Train the model on the labeled data using a suitable optimization algorithm (e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adam, etc.)
   - Monitor the model's performance on the validation set to avoid overfitting.

6. Evaluate the model:
   - Test the model on the unseen testing set to evaluate its generalizability.
   - Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.

7. Fine-tune the model:
   - If the model's performance is not satisfactory"

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path using A* search, we need to define a heuristic function. A common choice for the Manhattan distance heuristic function is:

h(n) = |Gx - nx| + |Gy - ny|

where (Gx, Gy) is the goal node and (nx, ny) is the current node.

In this case, the goal node is (3, 3), so the heuristic function for each node is:

h(1,1) = |3 - 1| + |3 - 1| = 6
h(2,1) = |3 - 2| + |3 - 1| = 4
h(1,2) = |3 - 1| + |3 - 2| = 4
h(2,2) = |3 - 2| + |3 - 2| = 2
h(3,2) = |3 - 3| + |3 - 2| = 1
h(2,3) = |3 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 2
h(3,3) = |3 - 3| + |3 - 3| = 0

Since the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, the optimal path will be the one with the lowest sum of costs and heuristics. In this case, the optimal path is (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3).

So the optimal path is: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)."

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.

She is passionate about preserving the environment and is willing to take bold actions to achieve her goals.

Character 2: A wealthy and influential businessman named Richard. He is a successful entrepreneur who values economic growth and development above all else. He sees Maya as a nuisance and an obstacle to his plans.

Here's a simplified explanation of how a supplier might be evaluated under PPAP:

1. **Pre-Production Phase**: This phase involves the supplier submitting design data, process flow, and process function analysis to the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer, like Ford). The OEM reviews these documents to ensure they meet the OEM's requirements.

2. **Shop Floor Operations Phase**: The supplier sets up their production line according to the approved design and process flow. The OEM may observe this setup and may request changes if necessary.

3. **Production Part Approval Process (PPAP)**: This phase involves the production of a small quantity of parts for inspection. The parts are inspected for conformance to the design and dimensional requirements. The OEM may also inspect the production process to ensure it is being followed correctly.

4. **First Article Inspection (FAI)**: This is a detailed inspection of the first article (or sample) of a new part or product. The OEM will inspect the part to ensure it meets all requirements, including design, material, dimensions, and performance.

5. **Production Part Approval Production (PPAP)**: This is a repeat of the Production Part Approval Process, but on a larger scale. The supplier produces a larger quantity of parts for inspection. The OEM will inspect these parts to ensure they continue to meet the requirements.

6. **Launch and Post DAP (Production Part Approval)**: After the supplier has passed PPAP, they will begin mass production. The OEM may still inspect parts periodically to ensure quality is maintained. If any issues arise, the supplier may need to go through a Post DAP to address these issues.

This process is designed to ensure that suppliers meet the quality requirements for the production of automotive parts, reducing the risk of defects in the final product. However, the exact process may vary slightly depending on the OEM and the specific requirements of the part or product."

[Intro Music]

Host: (Upbeat and enthusiastic)

Welcome to The Green Wave, the podcast where we explore the future of renewable energy and the steps we can take today to build a brighter tomorrow. I'm your host, [Your Name], and I'm excited to bring you a fascinating discussion on the future of renewable energy.

[Segment 1: Current State of Renewable Energy]

Host:

To kick things off, let's take a quick look at the current state of renewable energy. Today, renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power account for approximately 27% of the world's electricity production. That's a significant increase from just a decade ago, but we still have a long way to go to reach our climate goals.

[Segment 2: Technological Advancements]

Host:

Now, let's dive into some exciting technological advancements that could revolutionize renewable energy. Our first guest is Dr. Jane Doe, a leading researcher in solar energy technology. Dr. Doe, can you tell us about some of the promising advancements in solar power?

Dr. Doe:

Absolutely! One exciting development is the rise of perovskite solar cells, which have the potential to increase solar panel efficiency by up to 30%. Additionally, we're seeing advancements in concentrating solar power (CSP) technology, which uses mirrors to focus sunlight onto a small area, generating high temperatures and producing electricity through steam turbines.

[Segment 3: Economic and Political Factors]

Host:

Now, let's discuss the economic and political factors that impact renewable energy adoption. Joining us is Mr. John Smith, an economist specializing in energy markets. Mr. Smith, what are some of the key economic and political factors that influence the growth of renewable energy?

Mr. Smith:

Well, one major factor is government policy, such as subsidies, tax incentives, and renewable portfolio standards. Additionally, the cost of renewable energy technologies has been decreasing rapidly, making them more competitive with fossil fuels. However"

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","Congham Hall Hotel stands out among other hotels in the area with its charming ambiance and exceptional dining options. The hotel, nestled in the picturesque countryside of North-West Norfolk, boasts a tranquil and secluded setting, reminiscent of the rural beauty found in the west of Ireland. The Georgian mansion, which dates back to the 18th century, has been tastefully modernized while retaining its original charm and character. The hotel offers 26 stylish and varied bedrooms, ranging from standard to luxury, as well as a luxurious spa.

Yes, there can be regional variations in the flight patterns of Tabanus species, which are a genus of biting midges. These variations can be influenced by factors such as climate, geography, and local ecology.

For example, Tabanus sudetis, found in the Mediterranean region, is known to fly at lower altitudes and is more active during the day, while Tabanus bromeliae, found in Central and South America, is more active at dawn and dusk and flies at higher altitudes.

However, it's important to note that these are generalizations and individual behavior can vary. For a more accurate understanding of the flight patterns of a specific Tabanus species in a particular region, it would be best to consult local entomological resources or experts."

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
