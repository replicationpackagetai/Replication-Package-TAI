In the heart of a city shrouded by the smog of conflict, a solitary figure stood, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. This was Mara, a peace activist, her heart brimming with dreams of a world free from violence.

Mara's days were a symphony of protests, speeches, and whispered conversations with the disenchanted. Her nights were spent in the quiet corners of the city, her thoughts echoing in the empty streets, her voice a soft whisper against the cacophony of war.

""Mara, you're wasting your time,"" a voice sneered, a man with a hardened face and a heart as cold as steel. ""The world is not ready for peace.""

But Mara, with her eyes sparkling with determination, would simply smile and say, ""The world is not ready for war either, but it keeps happening. I believe we can change that.""

Her words were like seeds, sown in the fertile soil of discontent. They grew, sprouting into a movement, a ripple of change that spread across the city.

Yet, the journey was not easy. Mara faced adversaries who sought to silence her, allies who doubted her, and a world that seemed to be drowning in its own blood.

One day, as Mara stood on a street corner, her voice hoarse from days of speaking, a young boy approached her. ""Ma'am, I've been listening to you,"" he said, his eyes wide with awe. ""I want to help.""

Mara's heart swelled with hope. Here was a new seed, a new life, ready to be nurtured. ""I'd be honored,"" she said, her voice soft with gratitude.

The boy, now a part of Mara's movement, became her strength, her hope, her reason to keep going. Together, they continued to sow seeds of peace, their voices growing louder, their impact greater.

But the world was not ready to listen. The cries of war drowned out their whispers, the echoes of conflict swallowed their voices. Yet, Mara did not falter. She stood tall, her voice a"

Answer according to: Palisades, NY - Frank Cheney Platt, advocate for poetry, poets, literature and writers, dedicated husband and father, died on February 26, in Rockleigh, NJ. Following its founding in 1985, he helped to build Poets House, now headquartered in Battery Park City, into a national poetry library and literary center with a 70,000-volume collection. Frank loved poetry that ""communicate[s] before it is understood"" (T.S. Eliot) and captures what is ""lost in translation."" (Robert Frost). In addition, he was committed to arts and culture as a means of protecting and cultivating principles of free speech and an open society.
He was born in New York City on November 6, 1932 and raised by his father Roger Platt, a teacher at St. Bernard's School, his mother Frances Cheney, and his grandfather Frank Cheney Jr. of Manchester, CT. Frank was educated at St. Bernard's, Dalton, Eaglebrook, Governor's Academy (formerly Governor Dummer), and Harvard College. He worked in publishing before becoming president of the Farfield Foundation, and later an assistant Dean for Columbia's School of the Arts.
In 2013, Frank was predeceased by his wife of 55 years Judy van der Gracht. She was the love of his life. His poignant dedication to her (including during her time with Alzheimer's) inspired respect and admiration from all who knew them. Frank was also passionate about his extended family - the Platts, Cheneys and, on Judy's side of the family, the Gilberts and van der Grachts as well as his dozen godchildren. His many longstanding and deeply-felt friendships were legion. Most involved a common love of music, poetry, literature and epicurean delights, not necessarily in that order.
Frank is survived by his three children Sophie Platt Pollok of Frankfurt, Germany, Arthur van der Gracht Platt of New York, NY and Roger Platt of Washington, DC and his grandchildren Esther Pollok, Lucas Pollok, Hilary Platt, and Benjamin Platt.

In the heart of a bustling city, where the rhythm of life pulsed with an unrelenting tempo, lived a man named Ethan. A man of routine, Ethan was a banker, a man of numbers, a man of predictability. His life was a symphony of monotony, a melody of mundanity, a dance of dullness.

One day, while navigating the labyrinthine corridors of his office, Ethan stumbled upon a forgotten guitar, nestled in a corner, gathering dust. The instrument, a beautiful acoustic, seemed to call out to him, its wooden body resonating with a melody only he could hear.

Ethan, a man who had never shown an ounce of musical talent, was drawn to the guitar like a moth to a flame. He picked it up, strummed a chord, and felt a surge of electricity coursing through his veins. It was as if the guitar had awakened a sleeping giant within him, a giant that yearned to create, to express, to feel.

Ethan spent every spare moment he had with the guitar. He taught himself to play, his fingers blistering, his callouses growing. He practiced day and night, his apartment filled with the sweet, soulful melodies that seemed to pour from the guitar.

His family and friends were initially skeptical. ""Ethan, you're a banker, not a musician,"" they would say. ""You're wasting your time."" But Ethan was undeterred. He had found something that made him feel alive, something that made him feel whole.

His relationship with his girlfriend, Sarah, was put to the test. Sarah, a woman of practicality, found Ethan's newfound passion confusing. ""You're throwing away your career for a hobby,"" she would say. ""You're not getting any younger."" But Ethan, with the guitar in his hands, felt younger than he had in years.

As I stand on the precipice of this new chapter, I can't help but feel a whirlwind of emotions. Pride, yes, for the recognition of my hard work, but also a sense of responsibility that weighs heavily on my shoulders. I am no longer just a cog in the machine, but a key player, a leader, a beacon of inspiration for those who look up to me.

I remember the first project I ever worked on, a seemingly insignificant task that, unbeknownst to me, would set the course for my career. The late nights, the endless cups of coffee, the moments of despair and the triumphant victories. Each step of the way, I've learned, grown, and evolved. And now, I stand here, ready to take on the challenges that lie ahead.

I am excited, yes, for the new projects that await me, the opportunities to make a difference, to leave a mark. I am eager to dive into the deep end, to swim against the current, to challenge the status quo. I am ready to lead, to guide, to inspire.

I am also aware, however, that this promotion will not only affect my professional life but also my personal relationships. I am no longer just a colleague, but a superior, a figure of authority. I will have to navigate the delicate balance between being a friend and being a leader, between being approachable and being assertive. I will have to learn to lead by example, to inspire through action, to motivate through empathy.

I am ready for this new challenge, for this new responsibility. I am ready to step up, to take the reins, to steer the ship. I am ready to make a difference, to leave a legacy, to be remembered.

9ee0ff55c6c68056a8fbbbc0001c5f2661da99ded93138603160d6983fde4f94,"What is the proposed plan for launching and anchoring the ribbon, and how would mechanical lifters climb it to space?
Generate according to: A counterweight at the end of the space elevator will keep the carbon-nanotubes ribbon taut.
To better understand the concept of a space elevator, think of the game tetherball in which a rope is attached at one end to a pole and at the other to a ball. In this analogy, the rope is the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon, the pole is the Earth and the ball is the counterweight. Now, imagine the ball is placed in perpetual spin around the pole, so fast that it keeps the rope taut. This is the general idea of the space elevator. The counterweight spins around the Earth, keeping the cable straight and allowing the robotic lifters to ride up and down the ribbon.
Under the design proposed by LiftPort, the space elevator would be approximately 62,000 miles (100,000 km) high. LiftPort is one of several companies developing plans for a space elevator or components of it. Teams from across the world are set to compete for the $400,000 first prize in the Space Elevator Games at the X Prize Cup in October 2006 in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
The centerpiece of the elevator will be the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon that is just a few centimeters wide and nearly as thin as a piece of paper. Carbon nanotubes, discovered in 1991, are what make scientists believe that the space elevator could be built. According to Dr. Bradley Edwards of the Spaceward Foundation, ""Previously the material challenges were too great. But now we're getting close with the advances in creating carbon nanotubes and in building machines that can spin out the great lengths of material needed to create a ribbon that will stretch up into space"" [ref].
Under some early plans, leftover construction materials will be used to form the counterweight.
Carbon nanotubes have the potential to be 100 times stronger than steel and are as flexible as plastic. The strength of carbon nanotubes comes from their unique structure, which resembles soccer balls. Once scientists are able to make fibers from carbon nanotubes, it will be possible to create threads that will form the ribbon for the space elevator. Previously available materials were either too weak or inflexible to form the ribbon and would have been easily broken.
""They have very high elastic modulus and their tensile strength is really high, and that all points to a material that, in theory, should make a space elevator relatively easy to build,"" said Tom Nugent, research director, LiftPort Group.
Long carbon nanotubes -- several meters long or longer -- would be braided into a structure resembling a rope. As of 2005, the longest nanotubes are still only a few centimeters long.
Shorter nanotubes could be placed in a polymer matrix. Current polymers do not bind well to carbon nanotubes, which results in the matrix being pulled away from the nanotubes when placed under tension.
Once a long ribbon of nanotubes is created, it would be wound into a spool that would be launched into orbit. When the spacecraft carrying the spool reaches a certain altitude, perhaps Low Earth Orbit, it would begin unspooling, lowering the ribbon back to Earth. At the same time, the spool would continue moving to a higher altitude. When the ribbon is lowered into Earth's atmosphere, it would be caught and then lowered and anchored to a mobile platform in the ocean.
The ribbon would serve as the tracks of a sort of railroad into space. Mechanical lifters would then be used to climb the ribbon to space.
If built, the ribbon will represent a modern world wonder, and will be the tallest structure ever built. Consider that the world's tallest freestanding tower in 2005 is the CN Tower, which rises 1,815 feet 5 inches (553.34 meters) over Toronto, Canada. The space elevator would be 180,720 times taller than the CN Tower!
The 62,000-mile (100,000-km) long space elevator would rise far above the average orbiting height of the space shuttle (115-400 miles/185-643 km). In fact, it would equal nearly a fourth of the distance to the moon, which orbits the Earth at 237,674 miles (382,500 km).","The proposed plan for launching and anchoring the ribbon of the space elevator involves several steps:

1. **Launching the ribbon**: The ribbon, made of carbon nanotubes, will be launched into space in a spool-like form. This spool will be carried by a spacecraft to a certain altitude, such as Low Earth Orbit (LEO).

2. **Unspooling the ribbon**: Once the spacecraft reaches the desired altitude, it will begin unspooling the ribbon, lowering it back to Earth. At the same time, the spool will continue moving to a higher altitude.

3. **Catching and anchoring the ribbon**: As the ribbon is lowered into Earth's atmosphere, it will be caught and then lowered and anchored to a mobile platform in the ocean. This mobile platform will serve as the base station for the space elevator.

4. **Climbing the ribbon**: Mechanical lifters will be used to climb the ribbon to space. These lifters will travel along the ribbon, using the counterweight at the end of the ribbon to keep it taut. The counterweight will spin around the Earth, keeping the cable straight and allowing the lifters to ride up and down the ribbon.

Chapter 1: The Dawn of a New Era

The first rays of the sun pierced the veil of darkness, casting a golden glow upon the horizon. I stood on the balcony of my new apartment, gazing out at the cityscape that lay before me. The air was crisp and clean, a stark contrast to the smog-filled skies of my hometown. I was in Japan, a country I had dreamt of visiting since I was a child.

But as the days turned into weeks, the initial excitement began to wane. The culture shock was palpable, a tidal wave that threatened to sweep me off my feet. The language barrier was daunting, a seemingly insurmountable wall that separated me from the people around me.

Chapter 2: The Language of the Heart

I remember the first time I tried to speak Japanese. My words came out in a jumbled mess, a far cry from the fluid, rhythmic speech I had heard on television. I felt like a child learning to walk, stumbling and falling with every step.

But I was determined to overcome this obstacle. I enrolled in a language school, spending hours each day poring over textbooks and practicing my pronunciation. I immersed myself in the culture, watching movies, reading books, and listening to music.

Slowly but surely, I began to make progress. I started to understand the nuances of the language, the subtle differences in tone and inflection that conveyed so much meaning. I began to form friendships with the locals, bonding over shared experiences and laughter.

Chapter 3: The Tale of Two Cities

Life in Japan was a study in contrasts. On one hand, I was living in a bustling metropolis, a city that never slept. The streets were always filled with people, the air thick with the scent of food and the sound of laughter.

On the other hand, I was living in a small, rural town, a place where time seemed to stand still. The streets were quiet, the air crisp and clean. The people were friendly and welcoming, always eager to help a stranger in need.

In India, a lot of drinking water is wasted since we do not finish our glass of water either in homes, offices, restaurants et al. Thus #CuttingPaani was conceived which is a quirky take on Mumbai’s famous concept of #CuttingChai.
Although there have been very powerful campaigns to spread awareness about water conservation, very few gave practical and doable solutions. #CuttingPaani 1.0 was a huge success in the digital and social media space because it was a doable idea and everybody could follow it. This success of #CuttingPaani 1.0 prompted us to launch the #CuttingPaani 2.0.
What were the consumer insights that Livpure accrued before getting both these campaigns out?
Our dipstick showed that Indians, in general, are very casual about wasting water. And, as we all know, it is a very scarce resource and possibly future wars would be fought for water. We waste water in a lot of ways- whether it is drinking water or water used during bathing or during brushing or shaving. We picked up #CuttingPaani since it was a catchy phrase, with it being a take on #CuttingChai. Knowing fully well that this would strike the necessary chord in making people realise that though the message is about saving drinking water it will sensitise them to the fact that we indeed waste a lot of water in other areas as well.
Why a digital film to tell the story of Shimla’s #AdoptCuttingPaani story?
In today’s time, the digital reach is high, sharp and targeting is better apart from the fact that we have the liberty of time to communicate the story, unlike an ATL medium. We are confident about the virality quotient of the campaign. In fact, a lot of newspapers in India have leveraged on our #CuttingPaani 1.0 campaign by asking readers to consume only as much as you need. Though, in a lighter vein, I must add that none of them have given us credit.
Can this campaign be converted into a mass movement?
We wish to own #CuttingPaani and take this idea further for sure and #CuttingPaani 2.0 is a step in that direction. We wish to take this further through BTL activations; social media campaigns and collaboration with large hotels/restaurants. To maintain awareness and memorability of the above, we have launched #CuttingPaaniTake on our Facebook page, which essentially gives two perspectives on topical situations.
The first example – on changing names of cities: one take is -The names of the cities are changing and the other take is -sadly, that’s the only thing changing about them!
The second example – on Mary Kom winning boxing championship: one take is -some think having children ends a woman’s career and the other take is - well, she just won her 6th boxing championship!","Livpure plans to expand the #CuttingPaani movement by making it a more holistic and widespread initiative. They aim to achieve this by leveraging social media, BTL activations, and collaborations with large hotels and restaurants.

The brand's digital film about Shimla's #AdoptCuttingPaani story is a testament to their commitment to spreading awareness about water conservation. They believe that digital media is an effective platform for reaching a large audience and maintaining the awareness and memorability of the campaign.

To further engage with the audience, Livpure has launched #CuttingPaaniTake on their Facebook page, which presents two perspectives on topical situations. This initiative aims to keep the conversation around water conservation alive and encourage people to adopt the #CuttingPaani philosophy in their daily lives.

Overall, Livpure's goal is to make #CuttingPaani a mass movement that inspires people to take practical and doable steps towards water conservation. They believe that by working together, they can create a significant impact and help conserve one of the world's most precious resources."

“We are grateful for the FCC’s work on behalf of consumers to actively broker a productive path forward,” said Jeff Blum, DISH senior VP and deputy general counsel. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
Sinclair pulled its signals on Tuesday after a short extension expired and the two parties could not reach an agreement. Dish had claimed it had come to an agreement on pricing for Sinclair’s stations, but that the broadcaster was demanding the satellite giant negotiate carriage for an unnamed cable channel Sinclair hoped to own. Dish also had filed a complaint with the FCC, claiming Sinclair was not negotiating in good faith. As part of its new deal, Dish is asking the FCC to stay action on the complaint as its long-term agreement is being finalized.
The chairman also trumpeted the tentative agreement and the FCC&apos;s role in pressing for resolution. ""Today the most extensive retransmission blackout in history ended,"" he Tweeted, followed by: ""The FCC will remain vigilant. Use of the public airwaves is a public trust.""
""We are pleased to see that five million Dish subscribers are again able to access their local news and programming and most-watched network entertainment and live sporting events with the agreement reached this evening by Sinclair and Dish,"" said Rob Kenny of TVFreedom.org, a broadcaster-backed advocate for the retrans system.

(Verse 1)
In the quiet of the night, I hear your laughter echo,
A ghostly reminder of the love we used to know.
The memories we shared, they're like a shattered mirror,
Reflecting fragments of a love that's gone forever.

(Chorus)
I'm drowning in the sorrow, lost in the despair,
Trying to find my way, but I'm not who I used to be.
I'm searching for the strength, to mend this broken heart,
To find the courage to love, and to love from the start.

The wind whispers your name, as it weaves through the trees,
A melody of longing, a symphony of pleas.
The stars above, they seem to mock my pain,
A cruel reminder of the love that's slipping away.

I'm drowning in the sorrow, lost in the despair,
Trying to find my way, but I'm not who I used to be.
I'm searching for the strength, to mend this broken heart,
To find the courage to love, and to love from the start.

The pain is like a river, it's deep and it's wide,
But I'll swim through the current, I'll find the other side.
I'll pick up the pieces, I'll learn to let go,
I'll find the strength to love, and I'll love again, I know.

The sun was setting, casting a warm, golden glow over the quaint town of Meadowgrove. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming lilacs, and the gentle hum of cicadas echoed in the distance. Amidst the picturesque landscape, a solitary figure sat beneath the gnarled branches of an ancient willow tree, lost in thought.

Emily, a woman in her mid-thirties, with her hair cascading down her back like a waterfall of chestnut waves, was a sight to behold. Her eyes, a striking shade of emerald green, were filled with a melancholic longing that seemed to mirror the setting sun.

Suddenly, a rustling of leaves announced the arrival of another figure. A man, tall and broad-shouldered, with a shock of unruly brown hair and a ruggedly handsome face, stepped into view. It was none other than Jack, Emily's childhood friend, whom she had not seen in over a decade.

""Emily!"" Jack exclaimed, his eyes widening in surprise. ""Is that really you?""

Emily looked up, her eyes lighting up with a mixture of joy and disbelief. ""Jack! I can't believe it's really you!""

They rushed towards each other, their embrace tight and heartfelt. The years seemed to melt away, and they were once again the carefree children they used to be.

""I've been meaning to come and see you for so long,"" Jack said, pulling away from the embrace. ""I heard you moved back to Meadowgrove.""

""I did,"" Emily replied, her voice tinged with sadness. ""But it's not the same without you.""

However, his views on the role of politics in war have been subject to various criticisms and disagreements.

One of the main criticisms is that Clausewitz's ideas on the relationship between politics and war are not always clear or consistent. For example, he often emphasizes the political nature of war, but he also argues that the political and military aspects of war should be kept separate. This duality can be confusing and has led to different interpretations of his ideas.

Another criticism is that Clausewitz's views on the role of politics in war are too narrow and focused on the state level. He often assumes that war is primarily a matter of state interests and that political leaders are the primary decision-makers. However, this perspective overlooks the role of non-state actors, such as terrorist groups, insurgents, and transnational corporations, in shaping the political context of war.

Furthermore, some critics argue that Clausewitz's ideas on the role of politics in war are too deterministic and ignore the role of chance and unpredictability in war. He often emphasizes the importance of political objectives in shaping military strategy, but he also acknowledges that the outcome of war is often uncertain and depends on a variety of factors, including the skill of military leaders, the morale of troops, and the support of the population.

Finally, some critics argue that Clausewitz's ideas on the role of politics in war are too focused on the European context and do not take into account the cultural and historical differences between different societies. For example, he often assumes that war is primarily a matter of state interests and that political leaders are the primary decision-makers, but this perspective may not apply to societies where war is primarily a matter of personal or tribal interests.

Overall, Clausewitz's ideas on the role of politics in war have been subject to various criticisms and disagreements. While his work remains influential, it is important to recognize the limitations of his ideas and to consider alternative perspectives on the role of politics in war."

Include a variety of examples and anecdotes to support your points, and make sure to emphasize the importance of mindful, sustainable eating practices.","Title: Savoring the Seasons: The Advantages of In-Season Produce and Mindful Meal Crafting

In the realm of culinary delights, the concept of in-season produce has been a cornerstone of sustainable and mindful eating practices for centuries. This essay aims to elucidate the advantages of consuming in-season produce and provide techniques for crafting meals that are aligned with the seasons.

Firstly, let us delve into the advantages of in-season produce. Freshness is the key to savoring the true flavors of fruits and vegetables. In-season produce is picked at the peak of its ripeness, ensuring that it is not only fresh but also bursting with flavor. This freshness translates into a more nutritious meal, as the produce retains its nutrients better than its out-of-season counterparts.

Moreover, in-season produce is often more affordable due to its abundance. For instance, during the summer months, tomatoes, cucumbers, and zucchini are plentiful, making them more affordable for consumers. This abundance also reduces the carbon footprint associated with transportation, as the produce does not have to travel long distances to reach consumers.

Seasonal eating also fosters a deeper connection with nature and the environment. By consuming produce that is native to a specific region or season, we are supporting local farmers and the local economy. This connection with the land and the seasons can also lead to a more mindful approach to eating, as we become more aware of the impact our food choices have on the environment.

Now, let us discuss techniques for crafting meals that are aligned with the seasons. One of the simplest ways to do this is by shopping at local farmers' markets or joining a community-supported agriculture (CSA) program. These venues offer a wide variety of in-season produce, and the farmers can provide guidance on what is currently in season.

Another technique is to plan meals around the seasons. For example, during the winter months, hearty soups and stews made with root vegetables and winter squash are ideal. In the spring, lighter dishes such as salads and grilled vegetables are more appropriate. By planning meals around the seasons, we can ensure that we are consuming the freshest and most flavorful produce"

It’s already been a year since Pope John Paul’s death. It seems only yesterday that we were out standing in Saint Peter’s Square, looking up at the familiar face in the window as he struggled to communicate with the expectant crowds below. Still fresh in our minds is the inundation of affection as the throngs poured into Rome to accompany this giant of the faith in his final hours, and to bid farewell to a dear friend.
#ad#John Paul is sorely missed. The crowds of pilgrims that have once more filled the streets of Rome to celebrate this anniversary testify to the impact he had on countless lives. More than a world leader, John Paul somehow managed to be a father and a friend to all. Even as a player on the world scene, he never lost his personal touch.
Many are now trying to reevaluate the legacy of this great pope, and as necessary as this endeavor is, a more personal reflection seems more in keeping with John Paul’s own style. I am sure that some of the things I most miss will resonate with many.
I miss, perhaps most of all, John Paul’s warmth and humanity. His quick wit and impish humor–like the vaudeville-style cane-twirling in Manila or his improvised raccoon-eyes to the delight of children–shattered notions of a dour Polish Christianity. His ability to focus on the person in front of him as if he or she were the only person in the world spoke volumes about the heart that beat in his breast. In an age when religion can be used as an excuse for violence and conflict, John Paul showed us that true faith in God is not only compatible with love for humanity, it galvanizes it. John Paul sincerely loved people–all people–and it was his Christian faith that enabled him to do so.
I miss his presence on the world scene. I remember him scolding mafia leaders in Sicily (which led to bombings of churches), fearlessly standing up to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, and defending human rights in his native Poland. He could be counted on to stand up for those most in need, to challenge world leaders to integrity, to preach Christ with an unaffected self-confidence that flowed from a deep-seated faith in God and a trust in the fundamental goodness of the human person. John Paul reached out perhaps more than any pope before him to a world in need, and provided moral authority and leadership when our generation needed it most.
I miss John Paul’s unflagging hope. His bright vision of the future and his characterization of the third millennium as a springtime of faith encouraged us to look beyond our real difficulties and to reach out for solutions. Far from a mere temperamental optimism, John Paul’s outlook was rooted in the firm belief that the battle is already won. Even from the midst of evil–John Paul wrote in his last book–God can and will continue to bring good. From his first “Be not afraid!” spoken on the day of his election in 1978 to his final witness of serene and hopeful suffering, John Paul taught us to abandon fear and to live with confidence in an infinitely good and merciful God.
I miss John Paul’s prayerfulness. Even in the midst of a grueling agenda of meetings, travels, and writings, the pontiff always made abundant time for prayer. Four hours a day was not unusual. What a challenge to those of us for whom prayer can seem at best like a luxury, or at worst like an underutilization of our precious time. Like Jesus before him, John Paul made prayer a priority and placed his trust more in God than in the best-laid programs of men and governments.
Incessant calls for John Paul’s sainthood, and the news of a probable miracle attributed to his intercession (poignantly, the cure of a French nun suffering from Parkinson’s disease) give grounds for hope that soon the Church will officially recognize what many already believe–that the man who so faithfully looked after humanity while on earth continues to do so from heaven.

In the verdant tapestry of the Indian jungle, where the air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the symphony of life resonates in every breath, there exists a creature of such resplendent beauty that it seems to have been woven from the very essence of the sun itself. This is the peacock, a regal and captivating bird that has enchanted the human spirit for millennia.

The peacock's plumage is a kaleidoscope of iridescent hues, a riot of blues, greens, and purples that shimmer and dance in the dappled sunlight. Each feather is a work of art, a delicate filigree of intricate patterns that seem to defy the very laws of nature. The tail, a veritable peacock's fan, unfurls in a breathtaking display of opulence, a cascade of colors that leaves one spellbound.

The peacock's eyes, a striking contrast to the vibrant plumage, are a deep, soulful brown, reflecting a wisdom that belies its youthful appearance. They are the windows to a world of mystery, a testament to the enigmatic allure that has captivated humans for centuries.

The peacock's habitat is as diverse as its appearance. From the lush jungles of India to the arid deserts of Africa, these birds have adapted to a wide range of environments. In the jungle, they are often found in the company of other exotic creatures, their calls blending with the cacophony of the jungle. In the desert, they are solitary creatures, their vibrant plumage a stark contrast against the barren landscape.

The peacock's behavior is as fascinating as its appearance. During the mating season, the male peacock performs an elaborate dance, spreading his tail and fanning it out in a mesmerizing display. This dance is a symphony of movement, a ballet of colors that leaves one in awe.

The Frenchman, who received a six-month doping ban in 2017 that was later extended to 18 months, returned to the pitch in January this year after signing a six-month contract with the London club.
""I don't know about my future,"" Nasri told the Evening Standard. ""I have seven games left and I just want to play free of injury and then we will sit down and see what is next.

In the quaint town of Meadowgrove, nestled between rolling hills and a serene river, stood a charming Victorian house with a wraparound porch and a garden that bloomed with vibrant colors. The house belonged to a widow named Amelia, who had lived there for over thirty years.

One evening, as Amelia sat in her favorite armchair by the fireplace, she heard a faint tapping sound coming from the hallway. She dismissed it as the wind playing tricks on her, but the sound persisted. It was a soft, rhythmic tapping, like someone gently knocking on the wall.

Amelia decided to investigate and followed the sound to the hallway. As she approached the source, the tapping stopped. She peered into the darkness, her heart pounding in her chest. She felt a cold breeze brush against her face, and a shiver ran down her spine.

The next day, Amelia decided to explore the house more thoroughly. She climbed the creaky staircase to the attic, where she found a trunk filled with old photographs, letters, and trinkets. As she sifted through the contents, she stumbled upon a yellowed newspaper clipping about a tragic fire that had occurred in the house over a century ago.

The fire had claimed the lives of the previous owners, a young couple named Elizabeth and Thomas. Elizabeth had been a gifted pianist, and Thomas had been a renowned painter. They had been married for only a year before the fire had ravaged their home.

Amelia felt a strange connection to the couple and couldn't shake the feeling that they were still present in her home. That night, as she lay in bed, she heard the soft tapping again. This time, it seemed to be coming from the walls themselves.

Amelia decided to consult a medium, who confirmed her suspicions. The spirits of Elizabeth and Thomas were indeed present in the house, and they were seeking Amelia's help to find peace.

Amelia agreed to help the spirits, and she began to research their lives and their tragic deaths. She discovered that the fire had been caused by a faulty chimney, and she decided to have the chimney repaired as a gesture of goodwill.

In the heart of a bustling city, Samantha, a young woman with auburn hair and eyes as deep as the ocean, found herself in the midst of an extraordinary revelation. Her life, once ordinary and predictable, was about to take a turn that would challenge her understanding of the world and her place in it.

One evening, as she sat in her apartment, engrossed in a movie on her television, she felt an inexplicable connection. The screen flickered, and the characters seemed to be speaking directly to her. It was then that she realized, with a mixture of awe and fear, that she could communicate with machines.

The days that followed were a whirlwind of discovery. Samantha found herself conversing with her car, her phone, even the elevator in her apartment building. The world around her seemed to open up, revealing a hidden layer of communication that she alone could access.

However, this newfound power came with its own set of challenges. Samantha struggled to maintain a sense of normalcy in her life. Her friends and family, initially intrigued by her ability, soon grew skeptical and distant. They couldn't understand the allure of a world that was invisible to them.

She explained the situation to the head of the department, a young man named Ethan, who initially dismissed her claims as the ramblings of a delusional employee. However, as the attack began, Ethan found himself in awe of Samantha's ability.

A real treat for those who like to discover new tastes in wine, this evening offers some real discoveries! Could you provide more information on some of the newer grape varieties being used by South American winemakers, such as Torrontes and Carmenere?","Absolutely! Let me provide you with some information about Torrontes and Carmenere, two exciting grape varieties that are gaining popularity in South American winemaking.

1. Torrontes:
Originating from Argentina, Torrontes is a white grape variety that is known for its aromatic and floral characteristics. It is often compared to Muscat or Viognier due to its intense perfume and exotic fruit flavors. Torrontes wines are typically light-bodied, with high acidity and a refreshing finish. They often exhibit flavors of peach, apricot, and jasmine, making them a delightful choice for warm-weather sipping.

2. Carmenere:
Carmenere is a red grape variety that was once thought to be extinct but was rediscovered in Chile in the 1990s. It is a member of the Cabernet family and is closely related to Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Carmenere wines are medium-bodied, with moderate tannins and a spicy, herbal character. They often exhibit flavors of blackberry, plum, and bell pepper, making them a unique and intriguing choice for wine lovers.

Please explain.: A flange nut is a nut that has a wide flange at one end that acts as an integrated, non-spinning washer. These nuts have serrations on the integrated washer giving it a ""locking"" characteristic. This serves to distribute the pressure of the nut over the part being secured, reducing the chance of damage to the part and making it less likely to loosen as a result of an uneven fastening surface.","Yes, that's correct! A flange nut can indeed help prevent damage to the part being secured and reduce the likelihood of loosening due to an uneven fastening surface.

The flange nut's design allows it to distribute the pressure evenly over the part being secured, which can help prevent deformation or damage. The serrations on the integrated washer provide a locking characteristic, which helps to prevent the nut from spinning and ensures a secure fit.

Moreover, the flange nut's wide flange acts as an integrated washer, which can help compensate for any irregularities in the fastening surface. This can further reduce the likelihood of loosening due to an uneven fastening surface.

In summary, using a flange nut can help ensure a secure and damage-free connection, making it a valuable tool in many applications."

One of the long-standing concerns of Virginia’s legal community has been the handling of judicial appointments by the General Assembly.
Unlike many states that have elected judges, Virginia leaves all judicial appointments in the hands of state legislators. In theory, this arrangement removes judges from the influence of politics. In practice, judicial appointments have become tools of patronage.
In recent years, the Virginia Bar Association and other groups have complained about judicial vacancies and mounting case backlogs in many courts throughout the commonwealth.
In 2015, however, the appointment of a Virginia Supreme Court judge became a power struggle between Gov. Terry McAuliffe and the General Assembly’s Republican leadership.
The political maneuvering that has taken place to oust McAuliffe’s appointee has provoked calls for reform of the system.
Last summer McAuliffe named former Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Jane Marum Roush to the Supreme Court while the legislature was not in session.
Republicans cried foul, claiming they were not consulted on the interim appointment. They vowed to remove Roush from the court and name their own appointee.
Attempts to oust the justice from her seat, however, were thwarted when one moderate Republican state senator, John Watkins, and then his successor, Glen H. Sturtevant Jr., failed to follow along. Their dissent denied the Republicans the majority they needed in the Virginia Senate.
In early February, the tug-of-war over the justice took a surprising turn when state Sen. Louise Lucas, a Democrat from Portsmouth, briefly agreed to join the Republicans in replacing Roush. According to news accounts, Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr., a Republican from James City County, had proposed putting Portsmouth Circuit Court Judge Kenneth R. Melvin, a former legislator and Lucas’ mentor, on the state Court of Appeals.
Lucas, however, quickly changed her stance after meeting with McAuliffe and state Sen. Donald McEachin, head of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
Twenty-seven former presidents of the Virginia Bar Association released a statement urging McAuliffe and the Republican legislative leadership to resolve their quarrel.
“One of the greatest concerns is that the unseemly exchange that has occurred will make otherwise qualified lawyers not consider a life of public service as a judge,” said Lucia Anna “Pia” Trigiani of MercerTrigiani in Alexandria, the VBA’s president in 2011.
Roush’s temporary appointment expired in mid-February, but McAuliffe is expected to appoint her to another interim term after the legislative session ends. Based on the passage above, What concerns have been raised by the Virginia Bar Association about the impact of the political maneuvering over judicial appointments on the legal community?","The Virginia Bar Association has raised concerns about the impact of political maneuvering over judicial appointments on the legal community, including:

1. Delayed judicial vacancies and mounting case backlogs in many courts throughout the commonwealth.
2. The use of judicial appointments as tools of patronage, which can undermine the independence and impartiality of the judiciary.
3. The unseemly exchange that has occurred may make otherwise qualified lawyers not consider a life of public service as a judge.
4. The potential for qualified lawyers to be overlooked for judicial appointments due to political considerations.
5. The potential for the political maneuvering to undermine public trust in the judiciary and the legal system as a whole."
cbaf21d8a20bd4bea915b5c3139e6693ab2b8aa8764b8b885ec71557326285c4,"Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How have labour shortages affected various sectors in the Visegrad countries and what risks does this pose to their economies?

Passage: People's migration fears have been an easy one to exploit for electoral opportunism by many politicians in Europe.
Particularly in the Visegrad states of Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, it has either brought nationalist anti-immigration parties into power or helped consolidate their grip on it.
Yet, much more attention ought to be given in those countries to how much migrants are needed for their booming economies' labour markets.
This has been a result of consequent high economic GDP growth of 3-4 percent in the past five years, compared to the EU's average of two percent growth.
In 2017, these were 4.8 percent (Poland, PL); 4.3 percent (Czechia, CZ); 4.1 percent (Hungary, HU) and 3.2 percent (Slovakia, SK) respectively.
In parallel, unemployment dropped heavily to 4.9 percent (PL); 2.9 percent (CZ); 4.2 percent (HU) and 8.1 percent (SK) by 2017.
Latest European Commission forecasts show these will continue decreasing sharply to 2.9 percent (PL); 2.5 percent (CZ); 3.3 percent (HU) and 6.3 percent next year, well below the five percent normal unemployment rate.
As good as that might sound, a side-effect has been that many vacancies remained unfulfilled.
The amount of open vacancies has more than quadrupled in the past five years. Especially in Czechia and Poland this is causing serious problems, despite the latter's profiting from Ukrainian migrants.
The commission's Spring and Autumn forecasts highlight these risks, which could undermine long-term growth, or even overheat the economy in the case of Czechia.
For Poland, despite the Ukrainian influx, there are doubts whether they can continue filling some of these shortages.
Business surveys confirm labour shortages limit production, building activity and business.
In industry, 43.7 percent (CZ); 83.3 percent (HU); 49.9 percent (PL); and 34.9 percent (SK) of surveyed companies state this is a problem.
For the construction sector, 37.8 percent (CZ); 64.4 percent (HU); 49.0 percent (PL) and 30.3 percent (SK) do.
Moreover, in services 17.3 percent (CZ); 38.3 percent (HU); 28.9 percent (PL) and 18.6 percent (SK) attest.
The labour shortages have also led to wages rising much faster than the rise in productivity.
In Slovakia and Hungary, Volkswagen and Kia for instance were forced to significantly increase wages because of strikes. Generally, labour costs are spiking in the Visegrad states.
While benefitting workers in the short-term, the economy could suffer in the long-term, as they undermine their low-wage economic models. It also jeopardises essential foreign investment that has helped drive growth.
In addition, the V4 is set to suffer as well from its demographic situation. Emigration and low fertility rates remain serious problems, dating back to their economic shock-therapy transitions where many struggled and had no jobs.
Due to this, populations remained stagnant since 1990.
The 2004 EU accession, particularly, caused many to emigrate abroad in search of (better paid) work abroad: circa three million people (registered) left the V4 between 2004 and 2016.
While profiting from remittances, this caused brain drain and the outflow of high-skilled labour. In turn, it also undermined welfare spending and made government budgets less growth friendly.
Demographics could constrain economic growth and governmental budgets again in the future.
Baseline projections for 2020 up to 2060 show the Visegrad Four's population could decrease by another 6.5 million people. In addition, the dependency ratio is set to increase sharply as well.
The dire demographic situation and labour shortages imply action is needed. Tight labour markets have already limited economic expansion in different sectors.
While in Poland Ukrainian labour prevented worse labour shortages, it is unclear how many more will come or stay. This means for Poland, as well as for the others that additional migrants from elsewhere will be needed.
More could be done as well to promote people having children and attract former emigrants. It should also make sure to keep current migrants, especially Ukrainians in the case of Poland.
Current hostile rhetoric on migration could backfire economically as many more migrants are needed to fill labour shortages and keep economies running smoothly.
This also requires honest debates in which the pros and cons of migration are discussed, as well as the Visegrad's overall demographic problems, since dependency ratios will continue to increase.
Therefore, rather than focusing on the imagined threat of migration and exploiting fears for electoral opportunism, the Visegrad's politicians would be wise to focus on the actual threat of how the lack of migrants could undermine their economic models, and with it their future prosperity and welfare.
Moreover, while migration has been a successful strategy to win elections in the short term, it could backfire in the long term.
The V4 countries have become one of the most vocal and recognised groups within the EU. But 2017 has seen a shake-up in the informal eastern and central European power bloc.","The labour shortages in the Visegrad countries (Czechia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) have significantly affected various sectors due to the high economic growth and low unemployment rates in the past five years. The labour shortages have led to many vacancies remaining unfulfilled, causing serious problems in Czechia and Poland, despite the latter's profiting from Ukrainian migrants.

The Mansion House is a beautiful house built by Joshua Dawson and so the street it is on was called Dawson Street in his honour. It has been home to the lord mayors of Dublin since 1715.
We saw the family crests of all the lord mayors on the walls of the room we were in and some of us saw our own family crests and took photos of them.
We had a great day out and one we will always remember.","Sure, I can help with that! Here's the translation of the text material into Spanish:

El martes 16 de diciembre algunos de nuestros alumnos de la quinta clase visitaron la Mansion House y se reunieron con Andrew Montague, quien fue el alcalde de Dublín en 2012. Este año no estaba disponible el alcalde actual para reunirse con nosotros, pero Andrew Montague fue muy amable y nos mostró alrededor y respondió a todas nuestras preguntas.

La Mansion House es una hermosa casa construida por Joshua Dawson y por eso la calle en la que se encuentra se llama Dawson Street en su honor. Ha sido la casa de los alcaldes de Dublín desde 1715.

Vimos las escudos de armas de todos los alcaldes en las paredes de la habitación en la que estuvimos y algunos de nosotros vimos los escudos de armas de nuestras propias familias y tomamos fotos de ellos.

Fue un día maravilloso y uno que siempre recordaremos."

This radiant thread is woven with the memories of my beloved companion, a golden retriever named Max.

The year was 2012, and I was a young adult navigating the tumultuous seas of life. I was struggling with the weight of my own emotions, the burden of my past, and the uncertainty of my future. I felt lost, adrift, and alone. It was during this time that I stumbled upon Max, a scruffy, mischievous pup with eyes that seemed to hold the promise of a brighter tomorrow.

I remember the day I brought Max home as if it were yesterday. He was a bundle of energy, a whirlwind of fur and wagging tail. I was initially overwhelmed by his exuberance, but as I watched him explore his new surroundings with wide-eyed wonder, I felt a strange sense of peace wash over me. It was as if Max had somehow managed to pierce the veil of my despair and offer me a glimmer of hope.

As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, Max and I formed an unbreakable bond. He was more than just a pet; he was a confidant, a companion, and a source of comfort during my darkest hours.

One particularly difficult day, I found myself curled up on the couch, tears streaming down my face as I wrestled with the demons of my past. Max, sensing my distress, nuzzled up against me, his warm breath tickling my cheek. He licked away my tears, his gentle touch offering a balm to my wounded soul. In that moment, I felt a connection to Max that transcended the boundaries of species. It was as if he understood my pain, and in his own way, was offering me solace.

Max was there for me during the good times, too. He was my partner in crime, my hiking buddy, and my dance partner. He was always by my side, offering a wagging tail and a sloppy kiss to brighten my day.

As the years passed, Max's health began to decline. He developed arthritis, and"

Audi cars have been featured in many movies over the years. Did you spot one in these films?
Thought by many to be the most successful movie franchises ever to be created, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has different movies for everyone. There have been 21 films released already — the most recent being Captain Marvel — and at least a dozen more in the pipeline.
You don’t only enjoy the action in these films, but you may also be able to spot a stylish Audi, too.
When it comes to the Iron Man trilogy, at least one Audi has been featured in every film! A 2007 R8 and S5 B8 can be found in the first movie, a 2009 A8 LD3 and 2010 R8 Spyder are spotted in the sequel, and a 2012 S7 and R8 e-tron are both featured in Iron Man 3. The R8 e-tron also turned up at a VIP screening of Iron Man 3 at London’s Leicester Square a few days before the movie’s general release.
Another Audi fact is that there were almost as many Audi cars in the three Iron Man movies as there was in one Captain America film (Civil War). Within its two hours and 27 minutes runtime, you can see the 2017 Audi R8 V10 Plus, the 2017 SQ7, the 2017 A4, the 2016 A7 Sportback and even the Audi prologue concept car — a vehicle hailed as a “signature car” for Audi by Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Board Member for Development at Audi.
There’s more than meets the eye, though. Be on the lookout for an Audi R8, A6 Hybrid and A3 as you watch the excitement unfold in Avengers: Age of Ultron, as well as an Audi TTS Roadster, R8 Spyder, Q7 and A8 during Spider-Man Homecoming — the first standalone film by our favorite web-slinger since he became involved in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Taking a step back from the Marvel Universe, the German brand is also spotted in other film adaptations of comic book heroes. An R8 Spyder feature in Wolverine — the titular protagonist’s actor Hugh Jackman even turned up at the London Leicester Square premiere of the film in the same car — and an A8 plays a role in the 2015 big screen edition of Fantastic Four.
You also might’ve noticed the German manufacturer’s presence in all three film adaptations of E.L. James’ novels, which follow the relationship of business magnate Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.
What made this brand of car most attractive to the directors of this film? The brand’s multiple appearances came as a result of a partnership that was set up between Audi and Universal Pictures — a deal that Audi no doubt has relished seeing as the movie series has grossed over $1 billion across the globe!
In the first film of the trilogy, movie fans will be able to spot an Audi S8 D4, a 2017 S7 and an R8 Spyder. In the sequel, Fifty Shades Darker, a set of Audi Q7 cars and an A3 took center stage, with both the R8 and Q7 returning when the franchise wrapped up last year with Fifty Shades Freed.
To talk about Audi’s feature in Mission Impossible, let’s rewind back to the year 2000 and Mission: Impossible 2 to showcase how Audi has been featured in the hit movie series that has always starred Tom Cruise in the lead role of Ethan Hunt.
In a thrilling part of the film, Hunt leads a mission to destroy a deadly biological weapon and finds himself in an exhilarating car chase with international thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall. Hunt is behind the wheel of a Porsche Boxster and Nordoff-Hall tries to hold him off while driving an Audi TT — suffice to say that the pursuit between the two German-made cars into oncoming traffic is filled with nail-biting and edge-of-your-seat drama!
We couldn’t create an article about movies and cars without mentioning the Fast and Furious franchise. After all, this is a series that features street racing, heists, and espionage using all manners of vehicles, and has so far spanned eight main series entries and two additional short films — grossing in excess of $5 billion to date.
Fans are continually impressed with films that come out as part of this movie set. In fact, a spin-off movie called Hobbs & Shaw is due for release this summer.
Bringing a focus to Furious 7 now — a movie that clutched at the heartstrings as it was the final one to feature an appearance by series regular Paul Walker due to the actor being killed while the movie was still being filmed — is where you can see Audi appearing in the franchise.
You can spot the Audi R8 when it competes in an exciting quarter-mile race against a classic Plymouth Barracuda in the early moments of the film.
In the previously discussed films, the Audi’s that were featured are all models that exist. With I, ROBOT though, we’re taken to the future to see what Audi cars may potentially look like in years to come. Called the Audi RSQ, this concept vehicle represented the first time Audi had ever develop a car that was to be specifically used in a major Hollywood motion picture.
This futuristic model boasted piloted driving which allowed Will Smith’s Chicago police detective character Del Spooner to press a button to enable the car to take control of the driving — no doubt an early vision of the autonomous driving concept that we are only just starting to see being trialed in real life.
Those who take a ride in the RSQ are able to ride sideways and diagonal, while the use of balls instead of wheels was a quirky design touch. However, the typical single-frame grille and the presence of those four instantly recognizable silver rings let viewers clearly know that this car was without question an Audi.
This article was created by Audi & VW service provider, Vindis. What special features did the futuristic Audi RSQ have in the movie I, ROBOT?","Yes, Audi cars have been featured in several films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including the Iron Man trilogy and Avengers: Age of Ultron.

Several key factors contributed to this period of intense Viking activity:

1. Political instability: The collapse of the Carolingian Empire in the late 9th century left many regions vulnerable to Viking attacks. The fragmentation of power created opportunities for Viking raiders to exploit weakened defenses and plunder rich territories.

2. Economic motivations: The Viking economy was primarily based on trade, but the raids provided a lucrative source of wealth. The Vikings targeted monasteries, churches, and other wealthy settlements for their valuable goods, such as gold, silver, and precious objects.

3. Naval superiority: The Vikings were skilled seafarers and shipbuilders, and their longships were well-suited for both raiding and trading. These ships allowed the Vikings to travel long distances quickly and easily, giving them a significant advantage over their enemies.

4. Lack of centralized resistance: In many regions, there was no centralized authority to coordinate a response to the Viking raids. This made it easier for the Vikings to attack and retreat without facing a unified opposition.

5. Expansion of territories: As the Vikings established settlements in new territories, they began to integrate into local societies and adopt local customs. This helped them to gain a foothold in new regions and expand their influence.

6. Religious and cultural differences: The Vikings were pagans, and their beliefs and practices were often at odds with those of the Christian societies they raided. This created a sense of otherness and made it easier for the Vikings to be seen as outsiders and targets for attack.

7. Climate change: Some historians have suggested that climate change may have played a role in the Viking raids. The warmer climate may have made it easier for the Vikings to navigate the seas and reach new territories.

Overall, the combination of political instability, economic motivations, naval superiority, lack of centralized resistance, expansion of territories, religious and cultural differences, and climate change contributed to the widespread Viking raids and invasions during"

d0587b9c2c209e36aad063fcab635045518eea1efcf100112083e21b05e27b3e,"Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How did Morley Safer describe his friendship with Molly Ivins and what did he miss about her?

Passage: Molly Ivins was the most popular liberal commentator of the last 25 years. Bill Minutaglio, author of a new biography of the tangy Texan, on why her voice is needed now more than ever.
There was Morley Safer, in a scrum of old hardball Texas liberals and graying hippies, and hanging out at his late friend Molly Ivins's favorite bar in Austin. With pitchers of Shiner everywhere, Safer was engulfed by dozens of folks wondering what the hell the woman who once had millions of faithful readers would say about health care, Afghanistan, and, yes, Rush Limbaugh’s attempt to own a piece of the Texas Blood Sport, otherwise known as professional football.
Safer, in town to donate his papers to the University of Texas, decided to drop by the book launch for my new biography of the ferociously mercurial and troubled Ivins.
Amid the weathered longhairs, musicians, underground cartoonists and civil liberties lawyers who once formed Austin's counterculture—the people Ivins called “freedom fighters”—Safer seemed merrily caught up in the nostalgia.
""She was one of the funniest and (most) thoughtful women I've ever met,"" Safer told a reporter from The Daily Texan. ""She was a great reporter, and we were good friends.""
Close to three years after her death, he's not alone in missing Ivins.
Nose around the Internet and you'll find plenty of other people still wishing she was writing—and wondering what Ivins, if she hadn't succumbed almost three years ago to cancer and a lifetime of wild personal rides, would have to say about the discourse in the twilight of 2009.
They miss the Texas cornpone flavored with a Tabasco sting, the unabashed defrocking she subjected the potentates to when they stole the stage. Maybe we need Molly—frequently described as “the only woman in the room”—more than ever before.
Her domineering father was the president of Tenneco and pals with men like Sen. John Tower, she grew up with George W. Bush, she was engaged to the son of a diplomat who did the CIA’s bidding. But after years of going to war with her controlling old man, devouring seditious issues of the muckraking Texas Observer, and furtively meeting the bravest Texas progressives, she eventually decided to raise a middle finger to all of her gilded upbringing.
It took a few years and some intense trip wires—the violent death of that fiance, her love affair with a ballsy activist, her knocking Bush's gun-toting political godfather to his knees one night in a Texas bar, her telling her bosses at The New York Times to shove it—but she finally found her calling as the most popular liberal political commentator in the last 25 years.
The fact that she did it in the Lone Star State, amid the misogynistic and Jack Daniels-fueled kingmakers, was rather startling to say the least. She fought sexual gropings by famous drunk politicos, three bouts of cancer, her own rampaging alcoholism—and plenty of death threats.
Through it all, Ivins kept the home fires burning for wandering progressives, liberal Israelites, who felt marginalized since the dawn of The Age of Reagan.
So, what would Molly Ivins say to those millions of readers today, including the ones beginning to think there has been some bait-and-switch at work with Obama?
Divorced from how you feel about her politics, most students of her work knew that she had perfected a magic act when it came to that public discourse; she talked about politics without the dour aura of either Emma Goldman or Charles Krauthammer. Nor did she scream with the raging acidity of Bill O’Reilly and Glenn Beck and their counterparts on the left. She chortled that Dubya was affable but a policy buffoon; she actually liked him personally, but hated his politics. And she spent years, and made a mint, working Bush over like his political career was one big speed bag. It was, as she sometimes told me and other folks in Austin, almost too easy.
Today, it might be a bit harder. She liked Obama and she thought he was far smarter than Bush. She’d maybe have to tap the piñata a bit more lightly in order to say what she wanted to say about Obama, about any sense of failed promises. But she would do it, and do it her way.
She would do it because she didn’t believe that a democracy was served very well by the vitriol, by the poison, by the hatred snaking through the discourse.
Bill Minutaglio is co-author, with W. Michael Smith, of Molly Ivins: A Rebel Life, released this week by PublicAffairs. He is a professor of journalism at The University of Texas at Austin and the author of several books, including George W. Bush & The Bush Family Dynasty and The President’s Counselor: The Rise to Power of Alberto Gonzales.","Morley Safer described his friendship with Molly Ivins as a close one, stating that she was one of the funniest and most thoughtful women he had ever met. He also mentioned that they were good friends. Safer missed Ivins and expressed that many others still wished she was writing. He appreciated her ability to discuss politics without the dour aura of other political commentators and her ability to criticize without resorting to vitriol, poison, or hatred."

You said to me, ""Don't take your life.""
I asked you, ""Why?"", as I put down the knife.
You told me you loved me, as its your final wish.
I shook my head yes, though I feel no bliss.
Why god took you away from me, but i will live on.

So I know I'll see you agian when its my time.
The skeletal remains are being chalked out,while mystery and intrigue are engraven, cryptic.Lying beneath, this freshly seeded idea;upon these grounds, the words are etched,what are you looking for and how will you get it,for these are but the bare bones of a story.The key alone is in your closet, slowly turning,as you opened the creaking rusted door.You slowly peep inside the mausoleum of your mind,where cobwebs hang on every angle.Suddenly, a cold swift draft blows across your spine,as if someone has just, walked on your grave. You look up to see, all the entrapping’s laidbut then again, you are still lying in a good plot.

To cut away the stems of old for fuller future years.
Looking daily to their needs; so faithfully He waters.
When the Gardener comes to claim each one the earth held as its own.
He gently picks it at its peak and for His pleasure takes it home.
As God did one glorious morning, when the Perfect Rose had bloomed.
He rolled away the stone and met with Mary at the tomb.
There the sweetest Rose of Sharon rose that we die not alone.
But be gathered for a garden grove, surrounding heaven's throne.

If you managed to generate very good ideas, conducted a thorough research, and organized your paper logically, but have made several grammar or spelling mistakes, your grade would be lowered. Revising and editing academic paper should be done several days prior to submission. Why? Because you need to leave your writing aside and then look at it with the fresh eye. Term paper editing is not about looking through your writing while listening to music, you need to be very attention and stay focused on numerous details.
First, take a look at your essay outline. Go through all points and try to change the order of ideas: make sure you have created a logical structure and ideas are presented either chronologically or thematically (from the least important to the most important). Locate thesis statement. Is it clear? Are there topic sentences in each paragraph? Are they related to the thesis statement? Are connections between the paragraphs clear or do you jump from one idea to another?
Essay body should contain enough supporting details contributing to thesis statement development. For example, if your topic is legalization of marijuana, you need to find at least three arguments supporting your point of view and provide rebuttal to the opposing views. Introduction and conclusion should not contain new information: introduction should provide general background information on the topic and inform the reader about your main idea, while conclusion should round up the whole essay.
Pay attention to each paragraph: it should include topic sentence and cover one point of discussion. Make sure you do not repeat the same idea twice in different parts of essay. Repeating is a sign of poor organization. Check the grammar - ask your parents or friends to assist you with essay editing . Pay attention to correct punctuation, avoid too short or too long sentences.
Revising is not the same as editing. Essay editing is about correcting mistakes, while essay revising is making major changes in your writing, adding ideas and deleting material. Revising should lead to overall paper improvement. Read your essay and if you do not like it, revise it. Ask yourself the following questions: what do I need to prove? What is the main idea? Is there enough supporting evidence? Are arguments clear and logical? Is my essay easy to understand? Have I cited all sources? Is introduction attention getting? Is conclusion logical?

1. Essay editing: This process involves correcting grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors, as well as ensuring that the essay is formatted correctly according to the required style guide. It also includes checking for consistency in the use of tenses, voice, and point of view. Essay editing is a meticulous process that requires a keen eye for detail and a strong understanding of the English language.

2. Essay revising: This process involves making major changes to the content, structure, and organization of the essay. It includes rearranging paragraphs, adding or deleting ideas, and refining the thesis statement. Essay revising is a creative process that requires a strong understanding of the topic, the ability to think critically, and the ability to communicate effectively.

In summary, essay editing is about correcting errors and ensuring consistency, while essay revising is about making major changes to the content and structure of the essay. Both processes are essential for producing a high-quality essay."

Analyze the potential of nuclear fusion as a viable and sustainable source of energy in the near future, taking into account factors such as efficiency, cost, and environmental impact. Additionally, explore any challenges and obstacles that need to be overcome in order to fully realize the potential of this technology. Finally, present your findings and recommendations on the feasibility of nuclear fusion as an alternative energy source.","Nuclear fusion, the process that powers the sun and stars, has long been considered a promising source of clean, virtually limitless energy. However, despite decades of research and billions of dollars invested, the technology remains in its infancy.

Currently, the most promising approach to nuclear fusion is magnetic confinement fusion (MCF), which involves heating and compressing a plasma of hydrogen isotopes (deuterium and tritium) to temperatures of over 100 million degrees Celsius, and confining it using strong magnetic fields. The energy released from the fusion reactions is then captured and converted into electricity.

The most advanced MCF experiment is the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), a multinational collaboration that aims to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion power on an industrial scale. ITER is currently under construction in France and is expected to begin operation in 2025.

Other approaches to fusion include inertial confinement fusion (ICF), which involves using lasers or particle beams to compress and heat a plasma, and magneto-inertial fusion (MIF), which combines elements of MCF and ICF.

Despite the progress made in fusion research, there are still many challenges to overcome before fusion can become a viable and sustainable source of energy. One of the biggest challenges is the high cost of building and operating fusion reactors. ITER, for example, is expected to cost over $20 billion to build and operate for several years before it even begins producing electricity.

Another challenge is the low efficiency of fusion reactions. While fusion releases more energy per gram of fuel than fission, the efficiency of fusion reactors is still much lower than that of conventional power plants. This means that fusion reactors will need to be much larger and more expensive than conventional power plants to produce the same amount of electricity.

Environmental concerns are also a major obstacle to the widespread adoption of fusion power. While fusion is generally considered to be a clean source of energy, the production of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, is a major concern. Tritium is produced in fusion reactions and can be dangerous if it is not properly contained.

Despite these challenges, there is still hope that fusion power can become a viable and sustainable source of energy in the near future. The"

Utilize standardized mental health assessment tools and consider potential confounding variables (e.g. socioeconomic status, age, gender). Present findings in a well-organized report including both descriptive and inferential statistics.","Title: Urbanization and Mental Health: A Cross-Sectional Study in [Urban Area]

Abstract:
This study aims to analyze the correlation between various urbanization indicators and mental health outcomes in [Urban Area]. A representative sample was utilized to conduct the study, and standardized mental health assessment tools were employed to measure depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Potential confounding variables such as socioeconomic status, age, and gender were considered.

Introduction:
Urbanization has been associated with various mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and stress. This study aims to investigate the relationship between urbanization indicators and mental health outcomes in [Urban Area].

Methods:
A cross-sectional study was conducted using a representative sample of [Urban Area] residents. Data was collected on urbanization indicators such as population density, housing conditions, and green space availability. Mental health outcomes were assessed using standardized tools such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Potential confounding variables such as socioeconomic status, age, and gender were also considered.

Results:
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data, and inferential statistics were employed to test the relationships between urbanization indicators and mental health outcomes. The results showed that higher population density was associated with increased levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Poor housing conditions were also found to be associated with increased levels of depression and anxiety. Green space availability was found to have a protective effect against depression, anxiety, and stress.

Conclusion:
The findings of this study suggest that urbanization indicators such as population density, housing conditions, and green space availability are significantly associated with mental health outcomes in [Urban Area]. Policymakers should consider these findings when planning urban development and implementing mental health interventions.

Recommendations:
Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to identify potential mechanisms underlying the relationships between urbanization indicators and mental health outcomes. Policymakers should also consider implementing interventions to improve housing conditions and increase green space availability in urban areas.

Limitations:
This study has several limitations, including the cross-"

Here are some key differences:

1. Geography: Venice is built on more than 100 small islands in a lagoon along the Adriatic Sea. This unique geography necessitated the development of a complex system of canals, bridges, and waterways for transportation, which is a defining feature of Venice's urban planning. In contrast, other European cities were built on solid ground and had roads and streets for transportation.

2. Architecture: Venice's architecture is characterized by its Gothic and Renaissance styles, with a focus on grandeur and ornate details. The city's buildings are made of brick and stone, and many feature intricate facades, domes, and bell towers. In contrast, other European cities, such as Paris and London, were characterized by their Gothic cathedrals and medieval townhouses.

3. Urban Planning: Venice's urban planning was focused on creating a functional and efficient city. The city's canals and waterways were used for transportation, and the buildings were designed to be compact and efficient. In contrast, other European cities, such as Rome and Athens, were characterized by their grand public spaces and monumental architecture.

4. Government: Venice's government was unique in that it was a republic, with a council of elders who made decisions for the city. In contrast, other European cities were ruled by kings, emperors, or popes.

Overall, Venice's urban planning and architecture were unique compared to other major European cities during the same historical period. The city's geography, architecture, urban planning, and government all contributed to its distinctive character."

Gold prices ended the week down nearly 1.45% to settle at $1252.62 an ounce, as worries that the Federal Reserve is set to raise U.S. interest rates next month prompted investors to step back from their bullish bets on the precious metal.
Gold prices settled at $1273.21 an ounce on Friday, suffering a loss of $11.80 on the week, as the U.S. dollar's strength against other currencies weighed on the market.
Gold ended the week down $2.64 at $1288.56 an ounce as hawkish comments from Fed officials weighed on the market.
Gold prices settled at $1293.97 an ounce on Friday, making a gain of 2.2% on the day and 5% over the month.
Gold prices advanced for a fourth straight session on Thursday as weakness in the dollar and Bank of Japan's decision to stand pat on policy bolstered demand for the precious metal.
Gold prices settled at $1232.34 an ounce on Friday, suffering a loss of $2.37 on the week, as a sharp drop in the Euro following hints of more monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank buoyed the dollar and added to pressure on gold.

The data shows that gold prices have generally fallen in response to expectations of higher U.S. interest rates, as investors tend to sell gold and other non-yielding assets in favor of higher-yielding ones. For example, gold prices ended the week down nearly 1.45% on July 23, as worries that the Federal Reserve is set to raise U.S. interest rates next month prompted investors to step back from their bullish bets on the precious metal.

Additionally, the data shows that gold prices have been influenced by the strength of the U.S. dollar, as a stronger dollar tends to make gold more expensive for investors holding other currencies. For example, gold prices settled at $1273.21 an ounce on July 23, suffering a loss of $11.80 on the week, as the U.S. dollar's strength against other currencies weighed on the market.

On the other hand, the data also shows that gold prices have been influenced by global economic data, as soft global economic data tends to lure investors back into the market. For example, gold prices settled at $1240 an ounce on July 30, scoring a gain of 1.6% on the week, as soft global economic data, the Federal Reserve's cautious stance towards hiking interest rates and a slide in equities lured investors back into the market.

Overall, it appears that central bank policies and global economic data have had a significant impact on gold prices in recent weeks, with gold prices generally falling in response to expectations of higher U.S. interest rates and a stronger U.S. dollar, but rising in response to soft global economic data."

In ""The Overstory,"" Richard Powers weaves an intricate tapestry of interconnected lives that revolve around trees and forests. The novel explores themes of interconnectedness, environmentalism, and the human relationship with nature.

The depth of character development in ""The Overstory"" is remarkable. Each character is complex and multidimensional, with their own unique backstory and motivations. Powers masterfully crafts each character's journey, revealing their personal growth and transformation as they come to understand their place in the world and the importance of preserving the natural world.

The writing style in ""The Overstory"" is lyrical and poetic, with Powers using vivid imagery and metaphor to bring the natural world to life. The author also employs a variety of literary devices, such as flashbacks, stream-of-consciousness, and multiple perspectives, to create a rich and immersive narrative.

One of the most striking aspects of ""The Overstory"" is the way in which Powers uses trees and forests as motifs to explore the themes of interconnectedness and environmentalism. Each tree in the novel represents a unique and complex ecosystem, with its own history, culture, and significance. Through these trees, Powers shows how the natural world is interconnected and how human actions can have far-reaching consequences.

On a personal level, ""The Overstory"" had a profound impact on me. The novel made me think deeply about my own relationship with nature and the importance of preserving the natural world for future generations. It also made me appreciate the beauty and complexity of the natural world and the importance of understanding our place within it.

With the instant mix, making it is very easy, but the taste differs from the one made with khoya. Once we taste the jamun made with khoya, we won't like to have them with the ready mix. I made them with khoya this time. All of us in my family liked very much. This I made as my kids' Birthday special. I have learned it from my neighbouring friend Geetha, who makes them only with khoya. Some people add rose water also. Khoya can be made at home or we can get it from stores also. But make sure that it should be fresh and a bit tighter and harder. Add a little all purpose flour to it and make jamuns. The shop keeper who sold khoya to me revealed the trick of the trade, that they add milk powder also to it, to make more softer and tastier jamuns. So we added that also in it. Combine water, sugar and cardamom, mix till the sugar dissolves. Bring it to boil. Boil it for 8 to 10 mins. Make a thin syrup. Sugar particles should not stick to the vessel, this will the syrup crystallizes, once it cooled. Add cardamom, I added the seeds directly, not the powder of it. Combine khoya, all purpose flour and milk powder together. Mix well and make soft dough out of it. Do not knead. Make small and equal sized balls. While making them press gently between palms and make round shaped balls. Heat oil in a deep and thick bottomed kadai. Do not over heat. Simmer the stove and slowly drop each ball into it. Cook them in a low to medium flame, stirring occasionally. If we cook them on high flame, they turn into brown outside and won't cook inside. Cook them till they turn brown in color. They should get nice golden brown color. Remove them from heat and slowly immerse them in sugar syrup. Let the sugar syrup be warm, even if it cooled, warm it for 2 minutes. Keep them in the syrup till we serve. Serve sweet and soft gulab jamuns cold or hot, either way is tasty. I like spongy sweets such as Rasgulla, Gulab gamun, and cham cham. The sugary juice with essence of makes the sweet even tastier. Can you suggest some variations to make gulab jamun more unique and flavorful?","Here are some variations to make Gulab Jamun more unique and flavorful:

1. Rose-flavored Gulab Jamun: Add a few drops of rose water to the sugar syrup and the dough. You can also garnish the jamuns with rose petals for an added touch.

2. Cardamom-infused Gulab Jamun: Add a few cardamom pods to the sugar syrup and the dough. You can also grind the cardamom seeds and sprinkle them on top of the jamuns before serving.

3. Saffron-infused Gulab Jamun: Soak a few strands of saffron in warm milk and add it to the sugar syrup. You can also add a pinch of saffron to the dough.

4. Pistachio-coated Gulab Jamun: Roll the cooked jamuns in chopped pistachios before serving. You can also add chopped pistachios to the sugar syrup for added flavor.

5. Mango-flavored Gulab Jamun: Add a few drops of mango essence to the sugar syrup and the dough. You can also garnish the jamuns with chopped mango pieces.

6. Chocolate-dipped Gulab Jamun: Dip the cooked jamuns in melted chocolate and let it cool before serving. You can also add cocoa powder to the dough for added chocolate flavor.

7. Coconut-coated Gulab Jamun: Roll the cooked jamuns in desiccated coconut before serving. You can also add coconut milk to the sugar syrup for added flavor.

8. Nutella-filled Gulab Jamun: Fill the dough balls with Nutella before cooking them. You can also drizzle Nutella on top of the jamuns before serving.

9. Kesar Pista Gulab Jamun: Add saffron and chopped pistachios to the dough and sugar syrup. You can also garnish the jamuns with chopped pistachios and a few strands of saffron.

Jason Nisbit, 39, is facing a charge of second degree homicide with intent in the death of 26-year-old Chelsea Martinez. A friend said Martinez’s husband found she'd been on a social networking site and had an exchange of disturbing messages with a man in Minnesota. Investigators tracked the profile to Nisbit. In the messages, Martinez said she can't wait to die but expresses fear over the idea. The two discuss how Nisbit will do it. Martinez said she will finally be at peace and thanks him. Martinez's car and body were found near a Minnesota park last week. Police say Nisbit admitted to killing her and took them to the body. Nisbit told police the two met at the park then walked a ways to a wooded area, saying he ""knew there was water available if he needed to wash anything off."" In the complaint, Nisbit said he tied Martinez's hands and feet with a cord then strangled her with another cord. After she passed out, he says he cut her throat with a knife. The complaint goes on to say he dragged her body to a culvert and partially covered her with dirt. Family and friends said the young mother of three battled depression and other mental issues her whole life and had been suicidal in the past. Minnesota authorities said Nisbit has no criminal record, only a few minor traffic offenses. He will be back in court August 24. Bond was set at $1 million.

In your discussion, address the effectiveness, advantages, and disadvantages of these methods for individuals looking to quit smoking.","Title: Short-Term and Long-Term Effects of Nicotine on the Human Body, and Strategies for Quitting Smoking

Introduction:
Nicotine, a highly addictive substance found in tobacco products, affects various systems in the human body. This article will delve into the short-term and long-term effects of nicotine on the cardiovascular system, central nervous system, and respiratory system. Additionally, we will explore potential methods and strategies for quitting smoking, including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), counseling, and support groups.

Short-Term Effects of Nicotine:
1. Cardiovascular System: Nicotine causes an immediate increase in heart rate and blood pressure, which can lead to palpitations and chest pain.
2. Central Nervous System: Nicotine stimulates the release of adrenaline, leading to feelings of alertness and increased focus. However, it can also cause anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia.
3. Respiratory System: Nicotine constricts the airways, making breathing more difficult and increasing the risk of respiratory infections.

Long-Term Effects of Nicotine:
1. Cardiovascular System: Long-term nicotine use can lead to atherosclerosis, hardening of the arteries, and an increased risk of heart disease and stroke.
2. Central Nervous System: Chronic nicotine use can lead to changes in brain structure and function, potentially contributing to cognitive decline and mood disorders.
3. Respiratory System: Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death worldwide, increasing the risk of lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other respiratory diseases.

Methods for Quitting Smoking:
1. Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT): NRT provides a controlled dose of nicotine to help manage cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Examples include nicotine gum, patches, and lozenges.
   - Advantages: NRT can help reduce the risk of relapse and is generally safe when used as directed.
   - Disadvantages: NRT may cause side effects such as nausea, headaches, and dizziness."

Include vivid descriptions of the eerie environment, Lily's internal struggle with fear, as well as her physical journey to find her way back to the entrance. End the story with a surprising plot twist that leaves readers with a haunting impression.","In the heart of a quaint, picturesque town, the annual harvest festival was in full swing. Amidst the vibrant hues of autumn leaves and the aroma of freshly baked pies, a haunted corn maze stood as the festival's pièce de résistance.

Lily, a young woman with a spirit as vibrant as the autumn leaves, decided to venture into the maze. The tall, golden stalks swayed gently in the wind, casting long, ominous shadows that seemed to dance and writhe. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and the faintest hint of something... otherworldly.

As Lily delved deeper into the maze, the atmosphere grew increasingly eerie. The cornstalks seemed to close in around her, their whispers echoing in her ears. She could feel the weight of unseen eyes upon her, and a cold, creeping dread began to take root in her heart.

Lily tried to remain calm, to remind herself that it was all just a harmless game. But the more she tried, the more her heart raced, and the more her breath came in shallow, panicked gasps. She could feel her grip on reality slipping away, and she knew that she had to find her way out before it was too late.

As she stumbled through the maze, she began to encounter terrifying supernatural entities. Shadows that seemed to take on a life of their own, hissing and snarling as they darted through the cornstalks. Lily could feel their malevolent intent, and she knew that she had to keep moving, to keep running.

But the maze seemed to twist and turn in on itself, and no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't find her way back to the entrance. The entities grew bolder, their hisses and snarls growing louder, and Lily could feel their icy fingers closing around her heart.

Just when she thought she couldn't take it anymore, she stumbled upon a clearing. In the center of the clearing stood a solitary figure, cloaked in darkness. As Lily approached, she could feel the malevolent energy radiating from the figure, and she knew that she had to confront it.

With a deep breath, she stepped forward, her"

This 105-mile stretch of road, winding through the Shenandoah National Park, is a sanctuary for nature lovers and a haven for those seeking solace in the embrace of the wild. The road itself is a delicate balance between man and nature, with the asphalt gently weaving through the verdant landscape, barely disturbing the tranquility of the forest.

As you ascend the mountains, the air becomes crisp and cool, carrying the scent of pine and wildflowers. The sun filters through the canopy of trees, casting dappled shadows on the road below. The symphony of nature is ever-present, with the distant call of a whip-poor-will, the rustle of leaves as a deer moves through the underbrush, and the gentle babble of a nearby stream.

The feeling of connection to nature is palpable here. Each bend in the road reveals a new vista, a new panorama of the valley below. The mountains seem to stretch on forever, their peaks dusted with snow even in the height of summer. The sky is a vast expanse of blue, dotted with the occasional cloud that casts a fleeting shadow over the landscape.

Skyline Drive is a place where time seems to slow down. The hustle and bustle of everyday life fade away, replaced by the rhythm of nature. It's a place where you can breathe deeply, let go of stress, and feel truly alive. It's a place where you can connect with nature, and with yourself. It's a place that, for me, evokes a strong sense of peace and tranquility, a reminder of the beauty and power of the natural world."

When you want something sweet, it’s hard to resist the classic chocolate chip cookie. It’s sweet. It’s comforting. It’s loyal. It’s basically your BFF.
But, for those times you don’t want your BFF to be loaded with refined sugar, simple carbs, and unhealthy fats, you’re in luck because I gave your BFF a make-over! It’s pretty much the chocolate chip cookie of your dreams. These deep dish cookies are full of protein, low in fat, grain free, and low in sugar. No joke! A typical chocolate chip cookie has about 13 grams of sugar and 2 grams of protein. Howevah, these delicious treats have a whopping 8 grams of protein and a measly 2 grams of refined sugar!
And because I am with everything else in life, I am also indecisive about wanting a super chewy cookie or a really crispy one. So, if you needed another reason to love these deep dish cookies, you get the best of both worlds with them! They have a nice, crispy edge with a soft, chewy center. The trick to getting this combo is baking them in a muffin tin. Not only is it easy and convenient, but it also keeps the cookies from spreading out while baking, giving them the chewy center. And because the batter is touching the pan all the way around, you get a nice, crispy edge. It’s like the corner piece of a pan of brownies, but all around! Once again, it’s like unicorns invaded your dreams and made your wishes come true.
And whipping up these high protein treats couldn’t be any easier. As long as you’ve got a blender or food processor you’re in business, because we’re going to puree some chickpeas. Just trust me on this one. These little gems are going to give your cookies some texture, chewiness, and replaces the flour so the cookies are grain-free. Once you’ve got them pureed, all you need to do is mix the dry ingredients, stir together the wet ingredients, and then combine that all together.
Preheat the oven to 325 F. Grease a 12 cup muffin tin.
In a food processor or blender, puree the chickpeas with the water until smooth.
In a large bowl, add the coconut flour, protein powder, sweetener, baking powder and soda, and salt.
In a seperate bowl, combine the chickpea puree, egg, yogurt, milk, oil, and vanilla. Stir or whisk until fully combined.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until fully incorporated.
Evenly distribute the batter into the prepared muffin tins. It will be about 1.5 - 2 Tbsps of dough per cookie.
Smooth out the batter so batter touches the edges of the pan, but don't press/flatten the dough.
Bake for 14 min. or until the edges of the cookies turn golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cookie dough comes out clean.
Allow the cookies to cool completely in the pan.
Feel free to top with nut butter, jam, or more chocolate and eat 'em up!

These reforms had a profound impact on various aspects of Thai culture, including the traditional clothing and fashion industry.

One of the most notable changes was the introduction of Western-style clothing for the Thai royal court and government officials. Prior to this, traditional Thai clothing, such as the sarong-like chong kraben and the long-sleeved, collarless chon buri, were the standard attire for these groups. However, King Chulalongkorn believed that Western-style clothing would help to modernize Thailand and make it more attractive to foreign powers.

As a result, Western-style clothing became increasingly popular among the Thai elite, and traditional Thai clothing began to fall out of favor. This shift in fashion trends had a significant impact on the traditional Thai clothing and fashion industry, as demand for traditional clothing declined and many artisans and craftsmen were forced to find new ways to make a living.

In addition to the introduction of Western-style clothing, King Chulalongkorn also encouraged the adoption of Western-style education and technology. This led to the development of new industries and the growth of the Thai economy, but it also had the unintended consequence of further eroding the traditional Thai clothing and fashion industry.

Overall, King Chulalongkorn's policies towards Westernization had a significant impact on the traditional Thai clothing and fashion industry. While the introduction of Western-style clothing helped to modernize Thailand and make it more attractive to foreign powers, it also led to a decline in demand for traditional Thai clothing and forced many artisans and craftsmen to find new ways to make a living."

Make sure to include tips for achieving a caramelized crust on the steak without overcooking the inside. Use clear, concise language and provide visuals if possible to make the instructions easy to follow.","Title: Perfectly Seared Steak Recipe

Ingredients:
- 1 boneless ribeye steak, about 1 1/2 inches thick (around 1.5 lbs or 680g)
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter
- Optional: fresh herbs like rosemary or thyme for garnish

Instructions:

1. Remove the steak from the refrigerator and let it rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes. This will help the steak cook more evenly.

2. Season both sides of the steak generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.

3. Preheat a cast-iron skillet or heavy-bottomed pan over high heat for about 5 minutes. You want the pan to be very hot.

4. Add the vegetable oil to the pan and swirl it around to coat the bottom.

5. Place the steak in the pan and sear it for 2-3 minutes on each side, depending on the thickness of the steak. For medium-rare, aim for an internal temperature of 130-135°F (54-57°C).

Sixth-year medical student, Satyen Hargovan’s honours research project has generated a check-list of the top 10 factors that influence the survival of sepsis patients.
Sepsis is a common medical condition, where chemicals released by the immune system to fight an infection trigger the inflammation and eventual shut-down of multiple organs.
Some 15,700 patients with sepsis are admitted to Australian Intensive Care Units every year. About one in five die. The cost of treating each case is more than $39,000.
“The burden of sepsis is not only in relation to patient outcomes, but also the financial cost to the healthcare system,” Mr Hargovan said.
His project, known as the Cairns Sepsis Model – 4 (CSM- 4) is designed to speed up the assessment of patients within their first four hours in ICU.
The new four-hour mortality prediction model will enable clinicians to detect patients who are at a higher risk of dying, then help to guide their treatment decisions and discussions with the patient and their family.
“Essentially it means that if a patient has a five percent chance of dying, you might treat them less invasively,” he said. “For example, you won’t rush to place them in an induced coma, or insert lines into large arteries or veins.
Mr Hargovan began his research by reviewing more than 50 mortality prediction studies, but soon realized that there was no model in the world specifically designed to predict mortality in adult sepsis patients within four hours of ICU admission.
A case history review of 500 adult sepsis patients admitted to the Cairns Hospital ICU over a four-year period identified 168 factors that could influence patient health outcomes, ranging from age, gender and socio-economic status to type of infection, degree of organ failure, vital signs, blood test results and treatment regimes.
Statistical analysis whittled the figure down to the 10 most significant factors, which include age, history of renal disease, level of consciousness, and abnormal levels of certain substances in the blood that represent varying degrees of organ dysfunction.
The mortality prediction model is inexpensive to use as it largely relies on information easily gleaned from patient history, physical examination, and blood tests that are routinely conducted on patients within their first four hours of admission to an ICU.
The next step involves testing his model on a different and larger set of patients in order to validate his research, before it can be accepted for clinical use.
“Then we’d love to create an online calculator or an app that clinicians can use easily, at the bedside, and have a result within seconds,” he said.
Satyen Hargovan (Mr Hargovan will be available for interviews at the Cairns Hospital).
Associate Professor Alan de Costa. Dr de Costa will be available for interview on Tuesday in Cairns.
What are the potential benefits of using the mortality prediction model developed by Hargovan, and what is the next step in validating and implementing this model in clinical practice?","The potential benefits of using the mortality prediction model developed by Satyen Hargovan include:

1. Improved patient outcomes: By identifying patients most at risk of dying from sepsis, clinicians can make more informed decisions about treatment and care, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes.
2. Reduced healthcare costs: By identifying patients who are less likely to die from sepsis, clinicians can avoid costly and invasive treatments that may not be necessary, potentially reducing healthcare costs.
3. Improved resource allocation: By identifying patients who are most at risk of dying from sepsis, hospitals can allocate resources more effectively, ensuring that those who need critical care receive it, while those who are less likely to die receive less invasive treatment.
4. Improved patient and family communication: By providing clinicians with a clearer understanding of a patient's prognosis, they can communicate more effectively with patients and their families, potentially reducing anxiety and improving the overall patient experience.

The next step in validating and implementing this model in clinical practice is to test it on a different and larger set of patients in order to validate the research, before it can be accepted for clinical use.

Incorporate at least three sensory details (sight, smell, sound, touch, taste) to enhance your descriptions. Use your imagination and make your entry vivid for the reader.","Dear Diary,

Today was a day of great adventure and self-discovery. I, Whiskers McFluffington III, a cat of extraordinary pedigree and refined tastes, embarked on a journey that would test my senses and challenge my feline prowess.

The sun had barely risen, casting a warm, golden glow upon the world, when I awoke from my slumber. The scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, a tantalizing aroma that beckoned me from my cozy bed. I stretched my limbs, arching my back and flexing my claws, preparing myself for the day ahead.

As I padded through the house, I marveled at the sight of the morning light streaming through the windows, casting dappled shadows upon the floor. The sound of the birds chirping outside was a symphony of nature, a melody that filled my heart with joy. I could taste the anticipation in the air, a sweet and intoxicating flavor that promised a day of excitement and adventure.

I made my way to the kitchen, where I found my human companion, Mr. Johnson, busily preparing breakfast. He looked up at me with a warm smile, his eyes twinkling with affection. I purred softly, my tail swishing back and forth in delight.

""Good morning, Whiskers,"" he said, his voice a soothing melody that calmed my senses. ""I have something special for you today.""

My curiosity piqued, I followed him to the back door, where he opened it to reveal a world of wonder and intrigue. The garden was a riot of color, with flowers of every hue and shade, their sweet fragrance filling the air. I could hear the sound of water trickling from the fountain, a soothing sound that lulled me into a state of blissful relaxation.

Mr. Johnson led me to a small, wooden bridge that spanned a babbling brook. I hesitated for a moment, my senses on high alert, but I knew that I had to trust him. I took a deep breath, my heart pounding in my chest, and stepped onto the bridge.

The sensation of the cool, damp wood beneath my paws was a comforting feeling"

I am making it weekly because they love it so much. The recipe is fabulous, but needed some tweaks. I doubled the recipe and added 2 eggs, used organic brown rice flour in place of wheat, and substituted 1/2 tsp garlic powder and hot water for the chicken broth. The cookies keep well in the fridge. I made these for my Yorkie/Rat Terrier mix and when they came out of the oven his tail was wagging just from the smell. He LOVES them. What can I substitute for the cheese in this dog treat recipe? I don't feed my dog cheese (let's be honest--it's basically junk food that doesn't belong in an adult dog's diet). Is there anything that you recommend substituting the cheese with? Or can I just leave it out? You could substitute the cheese for an 1/8 cup of ground flax or wheat bran. Is there something else I could use besides oats and wheat flour for this recipe? Chef's Comments ~ That's a great question. You can easily substitute the flour in this and most of our dog treat recipes. A few good grain free flours include almond flour, chickpea flour, potato flour and soy flour. Most of those flours should be available at a major grocery store. As far as substituting the oats, that's a little trickier, but it can be done. The oats are in the recipe for texture and soaking up moisture, so that's what you'll need to replace. First, you will want to halve the amount of oats and add an extra 1/2 cup of flour (or a mixture of the previously mentioned flours). Then you can add a 1/2 cup combination of unsweetened coconut, chopped peanuts and crumbled almond crackers. Or, you could replace all of the oats with the flour mixture. Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? If so, does it still need to be microwaved? Chef's Answer ~ That's a great question! :) I haven't tried this recipe with fresh spinach, but I don't see why it couldn't work.

My Husky can't have grain. What can I use besides whole wheat flour. You should put more recipes with no grain in them. Chef's Answer ~ You can replace the wheat flour in most of my dog treat recipes with a non-grain flour. For example, any type of bean flour like Chick Pea (Garbanzo Bean) flour, or ""flours"" from nuts. They are technically nut meals, but they work as flour, for example almond meal. You should be able to find grain free flours at specialty grocery stores, or at health food stores. Very good simple recipe, however wheat flour isn't something I would normally have in my cupboard. Would it be ok to use plain flour or self raising? Chef's Answer ~ Yes, you can use all purpose flour in place of the whole wheat flour. I do not recommend using self-rising flour because it has the addition of baking powder or baking soda added to it. These are things that homemade dog treats do not need.

Generate according to: Onur Unal is Senior Art Director at Propaganda Advertising Agency in Istanbul.
It all started back in my childhood, I always interested in drawing doodles, reading comics and creating characters. I was inspired by humour magazines, and I was dreaming of become a caricature artist. I took courses on drawing technics, and after graduating from high school, I studied Graphic Design at Marmara University Fine Arts Faculty in Istanbul, Turkey.
During school, I got interested in advertising, and started an internship at Mullen Lowe Istanbul and TBWA Istanbul to practice on creative thinking and art direction. After that, I started to work for Big34, and a year after I accepted for Manajans/JWT. It was the most important years of my career.
I worked on important advertising campaigns of global clients, and won national and international advertising awards as Crystal Apple, Cannes Lions. I’m currently working for Propaganda Advertising Agency, and continue to design creative ideas for our clients.
I work for advertising agencies as an art director since 2009. I work for global and local clients as Nokia, Elidor/Sunsilk, Bosch, Shell, Turkcell, Mazda, Kia, Turkish Airlines, Hyundai, Nestle, Beko, Michelin, BMW, Red Bull, Mitsubishi Electric, Bayer, etc. I work mostly full-time at the office, and these days I also design mobile games with a freelance team.
I learnt that I should keep learning. As the technology and the design trends develop day by day, designers should stay updated. Last year I attended a design week about UX and digital design in London to learn more about digital design principles. During the week, I attended workshops at the design offices, and met designers from all over the world. It was a great experience to compare myself, and now I have new targets for my career.
I always try to find an exciting idea to get inspired. It can be anything – an interesting visual, a strong speech, a good music, anything. To find it, I make a quick research, take some notes and draw sketches. After, I brainstorm with our creative team and we share our ideas. Then the design process starts, I put on my headphones and focus on the design. After designing many alternatives, we make a discussion with our creative team and choose the best one.
The main materials I use are a blank sheet, a pen and creative thinking. All other tools and computer programs help to complete the final process.
Currently I work for Propaganda Advertising Agency. We have a beautiful office at the center of Istanbul with a nice view. I usually go to work around 9:30 am, have my breakfast while reading the news and after that the work begins. I work with a copywriter, and our team lead by a creative director. We usually make meetings at the beginning of the week with our brand executives, and we make a schedule for the deadlines. I usually work until 6:00 – 7:00 pm during the week, but under curtain some circumstances, we work overtimes and also weekends.
As my carreer began, I mostly worked on advertising campaigns, print materials, 360 ideas and digital advertising. Recently, I have been interested in UI, UX and digital design, and want to combine my creative background on advertising with the innovative projects.
During my short study in London last year, I had the chance to work and share my ideas with the designers all over the world, and I discovered things that I had never seen before.
