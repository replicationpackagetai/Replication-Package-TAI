When you encounter a 404 error while running `docker-compose up`, it's usually not directly related to Docker or Docker Compose, but rather to the services or applications defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Here are some common reasons and troubleshooting steps:

1. **Incorrect Service Names**:
   - Ensure that the service names in your `docker-compose.yml` file match the ones you are trying to start.

2. **Service Not Defined**:
   - Verify that the service you are trying to start is defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. **Incorrect Command**:
   - Make sure you are using the correct command to start the service. For example, if you have a service named `web`, you should use `docker-compose up web`.

4. **Network Issues**:
   - Ensure that the service is running and accessible. You can use `docker-compose ps` to check the status of your services.

5. **Port Binding**:
   - If you are trying to access a service via a port, ensure that the port is correctly mapped and the service is listening on that port.

6. **Service Configuration**:
   - Check the configuration of the service in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Ensure that the service is configured correctly and that the application inside the container is running and accessible.

7. **Logs**:
   - Check the logs of the service using `docker-compose logs <service_name>` to see if there are any errors or issues.

8. **File Path**:
   - Ensure that the `docker-compose.yml` file is in the correct directory and that the path is specified correctly if you are using a different file.

Here is an example of a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - ""80:80""
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
```

To start the `web` service, you would use:

```sh
docker-compose up web
```

If you are still encountering issues, please provide more details about your `docker-compose.yml` file and the exact command you are running, as well as any error messages you are seeing."

Based on the passage above, Can you paraphrase the first sentence of the text and explain the author's emotional state?","The first sentence of the text can be paraphrased as: ""I feel like a fortress that has been abandoned and is no longer accessible.""

The author's emotional state appears to be one of isolation, frustration, and perhaps even a sense of powerlessness. The use of the metaphor of an ""inaccessible"" or ""impossible"" fortress suggests a feeling of being trapped or cut off from others. This could indicate a sense of alienation or a struggle to connect with others or the broader community. The mention of ""enormous local entities"" and ""exploitation"" hints at underlying feelings of resentment or anger towards systemic issues. Overall, the tone conveys a complex mix of emotions, including frustration, isolation, and a desire for change or connection."

Here are some guidelines to help you determine how many plants you need:

1. **Space Size**: Measure the square footage of your closet office. A general rule of thumb is to have one large plant or three small plants for every 100 square feet.

2. **Types of Plants**: Some plants are more effective at removing certain pollutants. NASA's Clean Air Study recommends plants like:
   - Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)
   - Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)
   - Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)
   - English Ivy (Hedera helix)
   - Bamboo Palm (Chamaedorea seifrizii)

3. **Air Quality Concerns**: If you have specific air quality concerns (e.g., formaldehyde, benzene, or trichloroethylene), choose plants that are effective at removing those pollutants.

4. **Lighting**: Consider the lighting conditions in your closet office. Some plants require more light than others. For low-light conditions, choose plants like the Snake Plant or Peace Lily.

5. **Maintenance**: Larger plants generally require more maintenance. If you're not experienced with plant care, you might want to opt for easier-to-maintain plants.

### Example Calculation

- If your closet office is 100 square feet, you would need 1 large plant or 3 small plants.
- If it's 200 square feet, you would need 2 large plants or 6 small plants.

### Practical Tips

- **Air Purifiers**: Consider using an air purifier in addition to plants, as they can complement each other in improving air quality.
- **Plant Placement**: Place plants in strategic locations to maximize their effectiveness. For example, place them near sources of pollutants or in areas where air circulation is poor.

By considering these factors, you can determine the appropriate number of plants to improve the air quality in your closet office."

This example includes basic validation to ensure that only image files are uploaded and that the file size is within a reasonable limit.

### HTML Form
First, create an HTML form to upload the image:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
    <meta charset=""UTF-8"">
    <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"">
    <title>Image Upload</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Upload an Image</h2>
    <form action=""upload.php"" method=""post"" enctype=""multipart/form-data"">
        Select image to upload:
        <input type=""file"" name=""image"" id=""image"">
        <input type=""submit"" value=""Upload Image"" name=""submit"">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

### PHP Script (upload.php)
Next, create the PHP script to handle the image upload:

```php
<?php
// Define the directory where the images will be stored
$target_dir = ""uploads/"";
$target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES[""image""][""name""]);

// Check if the file is an actual image or fake image
$check = getimagesize($_FILES[""image""][""tmp_name""]);
if ($check !== false) {
    // File is an image
    $imageFileType = strtolower(pathinfo($target_file, PATHINFO_EXTENSION));
    // Allow certain file formats
    $allowedTypes = array('jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif');
    if (in_array($imageFileType, $allowedTypes)) {
        // Check file size
        if ($_FILES[""image""][""size""] < 5000000) { // 5MB
            // Allow only certain file formats
            if (in_array($imageFileType, $allowedTypes)) {
                // Check if file already exists
                if (file_exists($target_file)) {
                    echo ""Sorry, file already exists."";
                } else {
                    // Upload file
                    if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES[""image""][""tmp_name""], $target_file)) {
                        echo ""The file "". htmlspecialchars(basename($_FILES[""image""][""name""])). "" has been uploaded."";

Moreover, could you share a Ruby script capable of producing a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table?","To create a comprehensive comparison chart in HTML table format between traditional education and online education, taking into account the aspects of cost, flexibility, interaction, resources, and learning outcomes, using Ruby code, you can follow these steps:
1. Create an HTML table with the required columns and rows.
2. Use Ruby to populate the table with the relevant information for each aspect.
3. Use HTML and CSS to style the table and make it visually appealing.
Here's an example Ruby script that creates an HTML table with the required information:
```ruby
# Define the table headers
headers = [""Aspect"", ""Traditional Education"", ""Online Education""]
# Define the table rows
rows = [
  [""Cost"", ""Higher"", ""Lower""],
  [""Flexibility"", ""Less"", ""More""],
  [""Interaction"", ""Face-to-face"", ""Virtual""],
  [""Resources"", ""Physical campus"", ""Online platform""],
  [""Learning Outcomes"", ""Varies"", ""Varies""]

Body fat is essential for various physiological functions, including hormone production, insulation, and energy storage. Here are some potential consequences of having a very low body fat percentage:

1. **Hormonal Imbalance**: Low body fat can lead to hormonal imbalances, particularly affecting estrogen levels. This can result in irregular menstrual cycles, amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), and other reproductive issues.

2. **Reduced Muscle Mass and Strength**: While low body fat is generally associated with a leaner appearance, it can also lead to a reduction in muscle mass and strength. This can affect overall physical performance and increase the risk of injury.

3. **Weakened Immune System**: Adequate body fat is necessary for a healthy immune system. Low body fat can weaken the immune response, making the individual more susceptible to infections and illnesses.

4. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: A very low body fat percentage can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, which are stored in fat tissues. This can result in various health issues, including anemia, osteoporosis, and other nutrient-related disorders.

5. **Psychological Effects**: Extremely low body fat can contribute to body image issues and eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa. These conditions can have severe psychological and physical consequences.

6. **Metabolic Issues**: Low body fat can affect metabolism, potentially leading to metabolic syndrome, which includes conditions like insulin resistance, high blood pressure, and abnormal cholesterol levels.

If you or someone you know has a very low body fat percentage, it is important to consult a healthcare provider to address any underlying issues and ensure overall health and well-being."

However, in Lua and Luau, objects (like instances in Roblox) do not have a `ParentName` property by default. The `Parent` property exists, but it's a reference to the parent object, not a string name.

If you want to get the name of the parent of an object `v`, you would use:

```lua
local parentName = v.Parent and v.Parent.Name or ""No Parent""
```

This code checks if `v.Parent` is not `nil`, and if it is not `nil`, it retrieves the `Name` property of the parent. If `v.Parent` is `nil`, it assigns the string `""No Parent""` to `parentName`.

If you have a custom class or a specific context where `ParentName` is a defined property, you would use it directly:

```lua
local parentName = v.ParentName
```

But remember, this would need to be a property you've defined yourself or is part of a custom class."

Here's how you can set it up:

### 1. **Edit the sudoers File**

The `sudoers` file is used to configure sudo access. You should always edit this file using the `visudo` command to avoid syntax errors that could prevent sudo from working at all.

```bash
sudo visudo
```

### 2. **Add the Passwordless Rule**

You can add a rule to allow a specific user or group to use sudo without a password. Here are a few examples:

#### For a Specific User:
To allow the user `username` to run all commands with sudo without a password, add the following line:

```bash
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

#### For a Specific Command:
To allow the user `username` to run only a specific command without a password, add the following line:

```bash
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/command
```

#### For a Specific Group:
To allow all members of the `groupname` to run all commands with sudo without a password, add the following line:

```bash
%groupname ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

#### For a Specific Command in a Specific Context:
To allow the user `username` to run a specific command in a specific context without a password, add the following line:

```bash
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/command
```

### 3. **Save and Exit**

After adding the rule, save the file and exit the editor. In `visudo`, you can usually do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` to confirm, and `Enter` to save.

### 4. **Test the Configuration**

You can test the configuration by running a sudo command without a password:

```bash
sudo /path/to/command
```

If the command runs without prompting for a password, the configuration is correct.

### 5. **Security Considerations**

- **Limit the Scope**: Only grant passwordless sudo access to commands or contexts that are absolutely necessary.
- **Monitor Usage**: Keep an eye on sudo logs to ensure that the passwordless sudo access is being used as intended.
- **Use with Caution**: Passwordless sudo can be a security"

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy contracted by 20.4% in April, May, and June due to the coronavirus lockdown, performing worse than other major industrial nations, with Scotland experiencing a 19.4% decline."

Here are some examples:

1. **Matching the literal `=` character:**

   ```python
   import re

   pattern = r'='
   text = ""This is a test string with an = symbol.""

   matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
   print(matches)  # Output: ['=']
   ```

2. **Using `=` in a larger pattern:**

   ```python
   import re

   pattern = r'this=that'
   text = ""This is a test string with this=that.""

   matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
   print(matches)  # Output: ['this=that']
   ```

In these examples, `=` is not part of a special regex character class or metacharacter, so it does not need to be escaped.

However, if you were to use `=` in a context where it might be interpreted as a special character (e.g., in a character class or as part of a quantifier), you would need to escape it:

- **Character class example:**

  ```python
  import re

  pattern = r'[=]'
  text = ""This is a test string with an = symbol.""

  matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
  print(matches)  # Output: ['=']
  ```

- **Quantifier example:**

  ```python
  import re

  pattern = r'=+'
  text = ""This is a test string with == symbols.""

  matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
  print(matches)  # Output: ['==']
  ```

In these cases, `=` is part of a character class or a quantifier, so it needs to be escaped if you want to match the literal `=` character.

In summary, for the `=` symbol to be treated as a literal character, you do not need to escape it."

The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that Donald Trump has broken a presidential record by playing golf more than 70 times during his first year in office. Kimmel used this statistic to highlight his critique of Trump's accomplishments, suggesting that Trump has focused more on golf than on meaningful policy achievements. By emphasizing Trump's golfing record, Kimmel implies that the president has not prioritized significant accomplishments in governance, healthcare, or other areas that might have a more lasting impact on the country."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

It's a quaint little park nestled in the heart of the city, surrounded by towering skyscrapers and bustling streets. Despite its proximity to the urban chaos, this park is a peaceful oasis, a sanctuary where nature and humanity coexist in perfect harmony.

As I step through the gates, the sound of the city fades away, replaced by the gentle rustling of leaves and the chirping of birds. The air is fresh and clean, carrying the scent of blooming flowers and freshly cut grass. The sun filters through the trees, casting dappled shadows on the ground and creating a warm, golden glow that bathes the entire park in a sense of tranquility.

The park is filled with lush greenery, from towering oak trees to delicate wildflowers. The grass is soft and inviting, perfect for a leisurely stroll or a picnic with friends. There are benches scattered throughout the park, offering a place to rest and soak in the beauty of the surroundings. Children play on the playground, their laughter and shouts of joy filling the air.

But what truly makes this park special is the pond in the center. The water is crystal clear, reflecting the surrounding trees and creating a serene, almost magical atmosphere. Ducks and geese swim gracefully across the surface, while dragonflies hover above the water, their wings shimmering in the sunlight. The pond is surrounded by a winding path, perfect for a leisurely walk or a jog.

As I wander through the park, I feel a sense of peace and contentment wash over me. The beauty of nature, the sound of birds, the gentle breeze – all of these things combine to create a sense of serenity that is hard to find in the hustle and bustle of the city. It's a place where I can escape the stresses of daily life and simply be present in the moment.

This park is more than just a place to visit; it's a source of joy and happiness for me. Whenever I need a break from the chaos of the world, I know that I can find solace in this hidden gem. It's a reminder that even in the midst of a bustling city, there are still places of beauty and peace waiting to be discovered."

Sails are typically made of materials such as canvas, polyester, or nylon, which are visible and tangible. However, the force that propels a sailboat is generated by the wind, which is a flow of air molecules moving from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure. The wind itself is not visible, but its effects can be seen and felt.

If you're looking for reasons why a sail might seem to be ""invisible"" in certain contexts, here are a few possibilities:

1. **Light Refraction**: In certain lighting conditions, the sail might blend into the background, making it appear almost invisible.

2. **Distance and Size**: At a great distance, a sail might appear very small and indistinct, making it seem almost invisible.

3. **Color and Background**: If the sail is a similar color to the background, it might blend in and appear less noticeable.

4. **Transparency**: Some modern sails are made with transparent or nearly transparent materials, which can make them appear almost invisible.

5. **Low Wind Speed**: At very low wind speeds, the sail might not be fully extended or might appear flaccid, making it less noticeable.

If you have a different context or specific scenario in mind, please provide more details so I can give a more accurate answer."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

Here are some HTML data points that illustrate the different ways sleep deprivation impacts human physiology:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Physical Health:</strong>
    <ul>

In terms of the comparative analysis of the consequences of acute versus chronic sleep deprivation on overall wellness, acute sleep deprivation refers to a single night or a few nights of sleep loss, while chronic sleep deprivation refers to ongoing sleep loss over an extended period of time. The consequences of acute sleep deprivation can include impaired cognitive function, increased risk of accidents, and weakened immune system. However, these effects are typically temporary and can be reversed with adequate sleep.
On the other hand, chronic sleep deprivation can have more severe and long-lasting consequences on overall wellness. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to an increased risk of chronic diseases, impaired emotional regulation, and cognitive decline. These effects can be more difficult to reverse and can have a significant impact on quality of life.

However, many experts and organizations, such as the United Nations and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), consider climate change to be the most urgent threat to all life on Earth. 

Climate change is caused by the increase in greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere due to human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. This leads to global warming, which in turn causes a range of environmental problems, including:

1. Rising sea levels
2. Extreme weather events
3. Loss of biodiversity
4. Ocean acidification
5. Disruption of ecosystems and food chains

While climate change is a critical issue, other threats to life on Earth include:

1. Biodiversity loss: The rapid extinction of species due to habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change.
2. Pollution: Air, water, and soil pollution from industrial activities, plastic waste, and chemical runoff.
3. Overpopulation and resource depletion: The growing human population and its impact on natural resources.
4. Pandemics: The emergence of new infectious diseases, often due to human activities that bring people into closer contact with wildlife.

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string into a short, shareable string in JavaScript, you can use various encoding techniques such as Base64 or custom encoding methods. Base64 is a common choice because it's widely supported and easy to implement.

Here's a simple example using Base64 encoding and decoding:

1. **Encoding the string to Base64:**
2. **Decoding the Base64 string back to the original string:**

```javascript
function encodeToBase64(str) {
    return btoa(encodeURIComponent(str));
}

function decodeFromBase64(encodedStr) {
    return decodeURIComponent(atob(encodedStr));
}

// Example usage:
const originalString = ""This is a long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";
const encodedString = encodeToBase64(originalString);
console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);

const decodedString = decodeFromBase64(encodedString);
console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);

// Check if the decoded string matches the original string
console.log(""Is the decoded string the same as the original?"", decodedString === originalString);
```

### Explanation:

1. **`encodeToBase64` Function:**
   - `encodeURIComponent` is used to encode the string to ensure it doesn't contain any characters that might cause issues during Base64 encoding.
   - `btoa` converts the encoded string to Base64.

2. **`decodeFromBase64` Function:**
   - `atob` converts the Base64 string back to its original form.
   - `decodeURIComponent` is used to decode the string back to its original form.

### Important Notes:
- Base64 encoding will increase the length of the string by approximately 33% (since Base64 encodes 3 bytes into 4 characters).
- If you need an even shorter string, you might consider using a custom encoding method or a library that supports more compact encoding schemes.

### Custom Encoding (Optional):
If you need a more compact encoding, you can use a library like `btoa-lite` or implement a custom encoding scheme. However, Base64 is generally sufficient for most use cases.

```javascript
// Using a custom encoding library (e.g., btoa-lite)
const btoaLite = require('btoa-lite');

function encodeToCustomBase64(str) {
    return btoaLite(encodeURIComponent(str));
}

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node using heuristic search, we can use the A* search algorithm. A* search uses a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal, which in this case is the Manhattan distance (also known as the L1 distance or taxicab distance).

The heuristic function \( h(n) \) for a node \( n \) is the Manhattan distance between the current node and the goal node. The cost function \( f(n) \) is the sum of the cost from the start node to the current node \( g(n) \) and the heuristic \( h(n) \).

Let's apply A* search to find the optimal path:

1. **Start Node**: (1,1)
2. **Goal Node**: (3,3)

The heuristic function \( h(n) \) is calculated as:
\[ h(n) = |x_{\text{goal}} - x_{\text{current}}| + |y_{\text{goal}} - y_{\text{current}}| \]

### Step-by-Step A* Search

1. **Initialize the open list** with the start node (1,1) and the closed list as empty.
2. **Calculate the heuristic for the start node**:
   \[ h(1,1) = |3-1| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4 \]
   \[ f(1,1) = g(1,1) + h(1,1) = 0 + 4 = 4 \]

3. **Expand the start node**:
   - Possible moves: (1,2), (2,1)
   - Calculate the heuristic for each move:
     - \( h(1,2) = |3-1| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
     - \( h(2,1) = |3-2| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3 \)
   - Add these nodes to the open list with their \( f \) values:
     - (1,2): \( f = 1 + 3 = 4 \)
     - (2,1): \( f = 1 + 3 = 4 \)

4. **Choose the node with the lowest \( f \) value** from"

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.

6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz and achieve the ideal foam and bloom, follow these steps and tips:

### Ingredients:
- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz egg white
- 1 oz lemon juice
- 1 oz lime juice
- 1/2 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz orange flower water
- 1 oz heavy cream
- Soda water (Topo Chico is recommended)
- Ice cubes (small, about 3 cubes)

### Equipment:
- Cocktail shaker
- Strainer
- Collins glass

### Instructions:

1. **Dry Shake:**
   - Add gin, egg white, lemon juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your cocktail shaker.
   - Shake vigorously without adding ice for about 2 minutes. This helps to emulsify the egg white and incorporate air into the mixture, which is crucial for creating the foam.

2. **Add Ice and Shake Again:**
   - Add 3 small ice cubes to the shaker.
   - Shake vigorously until the mixture is well-chilled and the ice has mostly melted. This should take about 30 seconds to 1 minute.

3. **Strain and Serve:**
   - Pour the soda water into a Collins glass.
   - Strain the cocktail over the soda water.
   - Optionally, you can use a fine mesh strainer to catch any egg white foam that might have separated.

### Tips for Achieving the Ideal Foam and Bloom:

1. **Vigorous Dry Shake:**
   - The key to a good Ramos Gin Fizz is the foam. A dry shake for 2 minutes is essential to incorporate enough air into the mixture. If you don't have the time or strength to shake for that long, you can use a whisk to incorporate air into the egg white and other ingredients.

2. **Use Small Ice Cubes:**
   - Smaller ice cubes will melt more quickly, allowing you to chill the drink without diluting it too much. This helps maintain the integrity of the foam.

3. **Proper Straining:**
   - Strain the cocktail over the soda water to ensure a smooth, foam-free drink. If you notice any egg white foam separating, you can use a fine mesh strainer to remove it.

4. **Consistency:**
   - The amount of shaking can vary depending on personal preference and the strength of your arm."

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","What sets Congham Hall Hotel apart from other hotels in the area is its unique ambiance and exceptional dining options. The hotel exudes a charming and traditional Georgian charm, with spacious rooms that offer a glimpse into the past, complete with sash windows and five-star amenities. The hotel's tranquil atmosphere is evident from the moment you step into the driveway, surrounded by mature trees and manicured lawns.

The hotel's dining options are particularly noteworthy, with the executive chef, James O'Connor, creating delightful twists on classic fish, meat, and vegetarian dishes using locally-sourced ingredients. The restaurant boasts a spacious orangery-style dining room that provides a warm and inviting atmosphere, perfect for enjoying a sumptuous meal.

In addition to its excellent food, Congham Hall Hotel offers a range of amenities, including a luxury spa, tennis court, croquet lawn, and Secret Garden Spa with a swimming pool, hot tub, and various treatments and therapies.

These differences can be influenced by factors such as climate, availability of hosts, and local ecosystems. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Climate and Seasonality**: In regions with distinct seasons, Tabanus species may have different flight patterns. For example, they might be more active during warmer months and less active during colder periods. In tropical regions, they may be more active year-round.

2. **Host Availability**: The abundance and distribution of hosts (such as horses, cattle, and humans) can influence flight patterns. In areas with a high density of hosts, Tabanus may be more concentrated in those regions, leading to different flight patterns compared to areas with fewer hosts.

3. **Elevation and Topography**: In mountainous regions, flight patterns can vary based on elevation. Tabanus species may be more common in lower elevations where temperatures are warmer and hosts are more abundant.

4. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Some Tabanus species have evolved specific behaviors to cope with their local environments. For example, some species may have adapted to fly at different altitudes or times of day to avoid predators or competitors.

5. **Genetic Differences**: Over time, different populations of Tabanus can develop genetic differences that affect their flight patterns and behavior. These differences can be more pronounced in isolated regions where gene flow is limited.

While these differences exist, it's important to note that the overall behavior and flight patterns of Tabanus species are generally consistent across similar ecological niches. For detailed information on specific species and regions, consulting scientific literature or local entomological studies would be beneficial."

Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
