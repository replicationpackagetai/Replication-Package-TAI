When you encounter a 404 error while running `docker-compose up`, it could be due to several reasons. Here are some common causes and troubleshooting steps:

1. **Incorrect Service Name**:
   - Ensure that the service name you are trying to start exists in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Example: If you are trying to start a service named `web`, make sure `web` is defined in your `docker-compose.yml`.

2. **Incorrect Command**:
   - Double-check the command you are using. The correct command is `docker-compose up` (without any service name) to start all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - If you want to start a specific service, use `docker-compose up <service-name>`.

3. **Service Not Defined**:
   - Verify that the service you are trying to start is correctly defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     version: '3'
     services:
       web:
         image: nginx:latest
         ports:
           - ""80:80""
     ```

4. **Network Issues**:
   - Ensure that the service is running and accessible. Sometimes, the service might be running but not exposed correctly.
   - Check the logs of the service using `docker-compose logs <service-name>`.

5. **Incorrect Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the configuration in your `docker-compose.yml` file is correct and does not contain any typos or syntax errors.
   - Run `docker-compose config` to validate the configuration.

6. **Service Not Built**:
   - If you are using a custom Dockerfile, ensure that the service is built correctly.
   - Run `docker-compose build` before starting the services.

7. **Port Conflicts**:
   - Ensure that the ports you are trying to map are not already in use by another process.
   - You can check running containers and processes using `docker ps` and `netstat -tuln`.

8. **Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure that any required environment variables are set correctly in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

Here is an example of a simple `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest

This metaphor conveys the author's sense of isolation and desolation. The image of a ""ruined fort"" suggests a place that was once grand or significant but is now in disrepair and no longer accessible or functional. This likely reflects the author's feelings of being trapped, disconnected, or disillusioned. The use of ""inaccessible"" further emphasizes a sense of being cut off from others or from a better state of being, possibly due to personal, social, or political circumstances. Overall, the author seems to be expressing a deep emotional state of despair and alienation."

Here are some guidelines to help you determine how many plants you might need:

1. **Space Size**: Measure the square footage of your closet office. A general rule of thumb is that one large plant can improve air quality in about 100 square feet of space.

2. **Types of Plants**: Some plants are more effective at removing certain pollutants. NASA's Clean Air Study identified several plants that are particularly good at air purification:
   - **Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)**
   - **Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)**
   - **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)**
   - **Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica)**
   - **Boston Fern (Nephrolepis exaltata)**
   - **English Ivy (Hedera helix)**

3. **Air Quality Concerns**: If you have specific air quality concerns (e.g., formaldehyde, benzene, or trichloroethylene), choose plants that are known to remove those pollutants.

4. **Lighting**: Consider the lighting in your closet office. Some plants require more light than others. For low-light conditions, choose plants like the snake plant or peace lily.

5. **Maintenance**: Ensure you can maintain the plants properly. Overwatering or neglect can lead to plant death, which might not be ideal in a closet office.

### Example Calculation
If your closet office is 100 square feet, you might need about one large plant. If it's 200 square feet, you might need two large plants. For a smaller space, you could use multiple smaller plants.

### Recommended Plants
- **For a 100 square foot space**: 1-2 large plants (e.g., snake plant, peace lily).
- **For a 200 square foot space**: 2-4 large plants or 4-8 smaller plants.

### Additional Tips
- **Group Plants**: Grouping plants can enhance their effectiveness in improving air quality.
- **Regular Care**: Ensure you water, fertilize, and prune your plants regularly to keep them healthy and effective.

I am having difficulties with the older students complaining about the younger students and being disrespectful towards them. What are some teaching strategies or activities that encourage team building and bonding between band students?,"Addressing the issue of older students being disrespectful towards younger ones in a band setting can be challenging, but there are several strategies and activities that can help foster a more inclusive and supportive environment. Here are some ideas:

### 1. **Team Building Activities**
   - **Icebreaker Games:** Start each semester with icebreaker games that help students get to know each other. Examples include ""Two Truths and a Lie,"" ""Human Bingo,"" or ""Two Words That Describe You.""
   - **Group Challenges:** Organize activities that require collaboration, such as building a tower with limited materials or solving a puzzle together. These activities can help students work together and build trust.

### 2. **Role Reversal Activities**
   - **Conduct a ""Day in the Life"" Activity:** Have older students shadow younger students for a day, experiencing their challenges and responsibilities. This can help older students understand the difficulties faced by younger students.
   - **Swap Roles:** Occasionally, have older students take on the role of section leaders or mentors for younger students. This can help build a sense of responsibility and mutual respect.

### 3. **Structured Collaboration**
   - **Section Leaders:** Assign section leaders from both older and younger students. These leaders can help mediate conflicts and ensure that everyone is contributing equally.
   - **Peer Mentoring:** Pair older students with younger ones for one-on-one mentoring. This can help build relationships and provide support.

### 4. **Inclusive Repertoire**
   - **Diverse Repertoire:** Choose a variety of music that appeals to all age groups. This can help create a shared experience and common ground.
   - **Collaborative Arrangements:** Encourage students to collaborate on arranging or composing music. This can help build a sense of ownership and pride in the ensemble.

### 5. **Conflict Resolution Training**
   - **Workshops:** Conduct workshops on conflict resolution and communication skills. Teach students how to express their feelings and concerns in a respectful manner.
   - **Peer Mediation:** Train a group of students to act as peer mediators. These students can help resolve conflicts between peers in a structured and supportive way.

### 6. **Positive Reinforcement**
   - **Recognition:** Regularly recognize and reward positive behavior and teamwork. This can help create a culture of appreciation and respect.
   - **Feedback Sessions:** Hold regular feedback sessions where students can share their thoughts and feelings about the band environment. Use this"

1. **Energy Storage**: Fat stores energy that the body can use when food intake is low.
2. **Thermal Insulation**: Fat helps to insulate the body and maintain core temperature.
3. **Hormone Production**: Fat tissue produces hormones like estrogen, which are crucial for reproductive health.
4. **Nutrient Storage**: Fat helps store fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K).
5. **Protective Cushioning**: Fat provides cushioning for organs and joints.

If a woman's body fat percentage is significantly below 16%, she may experience:

- **Menstrual Irregularities or Amenorrhea**: Low body fat can disrupt the hormonal balance necessary for regular menstrual cycles.
- **Decreased Fertility**: Reduced estrogen levels can negatively impact fertility.
- **Bone Density Loss**: Fat is involved in the production of hormones that help maintain bone density. Low body fat can lead to osteoporosis or osteopenia.
- **Weakened Immune System**: Fat tissue plays a role in immune function, and very low body fat can weaken the immune system.
- **Muscle Wasting**: The body may start breaking down muscle tissue for energy, leading to muscle loss.
- **Increased Risk of Injuries**: Without adequate fat padding, joints and bones are more vulnerable to injury.
- **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Low body fat can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients.

It's important for women to maintain a healthy body fat percentage within a range that supports overall health and well-being. If you or someone you know is concerned about body fat percentage, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian for personalized advice and support."

However, there is no direct `v.ParentName` property in Lua or Luau.

If you want to access the `Name` property of an object's parent, you would do it like this:

```lua
local parentName = v.Parent.Name
```

If you are looking for a more concise or specific syntax, you might consider creating a custom function or using a table to store the parent's name, but this is not a built-in feature.

For example:

```lua
local function getParentName(v)
    return v.Parent.Name
end

local parentName = getParentName(v)
```

Or if you want to store the parent's name in a variable for later use:

```lua
local parentName = v.Parent.Name
```

This approach is straightforward and works well in Lua and Luau."

### 1. **Edit the sudoers File**
   The `sudoers` file controls who can run what commands as what users. You should always edit this file with the `visudo` command to avoid syntax errors that could prevent sudo from working at all.

   ```bash
   sudo visudo
   ```

### 2. **Add the User to the `sudo` Group (Optional)**
   If you want to allow a user to run all commands without a password, you can add them to the `sudo` group. This is not necessary if you are configuring a specific user or command.

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG sudo username
   ```

### 3. **Configure Passwordless Sudo for a Specific User and Command**
   You can configure sudo to allow a specific user to run a specific command without a password. For example, to allow the user `username` to run `apt-get update` without a password:

   ```bash
   username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get update
   ```

   If you want to allow the user to run any command without a password, you can use:

   ```bash
   username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

### 4. **Verify the Configuration**
   After making changes, save the file and exit the editor. You can test the configuration by logging out and back in as the user or by running a command with sudo.

### 5. **Security Considerations**
   - **Limit the Scope**: Only grant passwordless sudo access for commands or groups of commands that are necessary.
   - **Monitor Usage**: Keep an eye on sudo logs to ensure that the passwordless sudo access is being used as intended.
   - **Use with Caution**: Passwordless sudo can be a security risk if misused, so it should be used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.

### Example `sudoers` File Snippet
Here is an example of what the `sudoers` file might look like with passwordless sudo for a specific user and command:

```bash
# Allow user 'username' to run 'apt-get update' without a password
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASS"

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy contracted by 20.4% in April, May, and June due to the coronavirus lockdown, performing worse than other major industrial nations, with Scotland experiencing a slighter smaller decline of 19.4%."

Here are some examples to illustrate this:

1. **Literal `=`**:
   - If you want to match the literal `=` character, you do not need to escape it:
     ```python
     import re

     pattern = r'='
     text = ""This is a test with an = sign.""
     match = re.search(pattern, text)
     print(match)  # <re.Match object; span=(26, 27), match='='>
     ```

2. **Special Characters**:
   - If `=` is part of a special regex pattern, you might need to escape it. For example, `+*?` are special characters in regex, but `=` is not. However, if you are using `=` in a context where it might be interpreted as a special character, you can escape it:
     ```python
     pattern = r'\='  # Escaping = to treat it as a literal
     text = ""This is a test with an = sign.""
     match = re.search(pattern, text)
     print(match)  # <re.Match object; span=(26, 27), match='='>
     ```

3. **Using `=` in a Pattern**:
   - If you are using `=` in a pattern where it might be interpreted as a special character, you can escape it:
     ```python
     pattern = r'='  # This is fine as = is not a special character
     text = ""This is a test with an = sign.""
     match = re.search(pattern, text)
     print(match)  # <re.Match object; span=(26, 27), match='='>
     ```

In summary, you do not need to escape the `=` symbol in most cases when you want to match it as a literal character. However, if you are in a context where `=` might be interpreted as a special character, you can escape it for clarity or to ensure it is treated as a literal."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that Donald Trump has broken a presidential record by playing golf more than 70 times during his first year in office. This statistic serves as a backdrop for Kimmel's critique of Trump's accomplishments, suggesting that while many people claim Trump hasn't achieved much, he has spent a significant amount of time on leisure activities like golf rather than focusing on governance. Kimmel uses this as a segue to highlight another area where he sees Trump's administration failing, namely in efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act. He encourages viewers to consider the benefits of the new health care plan, even if they do not support Trump, and to sign up if they don't already have health insurance."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

The village is surrounded by lush green fields and towering trees that provide a natural canopy overhead. As I walk through the village, I am greeted by the warm and friendly faces of the locals, who are always eager to share their stories and traditions with visitors.

The village square is the heart of the community, where people gather to socialize, shop, and enjoy the local cuisine. The square is adorned with colorful flower beds and a charming fountain that provides a soothing sound as the water trickles over its stone surface. The air is filled with the aroma of freshly baked bread and the sweet scent of blooming flowers.

One of my favorite places in the village is the old windmill that stands tall and proud on the hill overlooking the village. The windmill has been a symbol of the village for generations and is a testament to the hard work and ingenuity of the people who built it. As I stand at the base of the windmill, I can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder at its sheer size and beauty.

The village also has a small river that winds its way through the heart of the community. The river is a peaceful and serene place where people come to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The water is crystal clear and the banks are lined with wildflowers and lush greenery. On a warm summer day, I love to take a leisurely stroll along the riverbank, feeling the gentle breeze on my face and the sun warming my skin.

What makes this village so special to me is the sense of community and connection that exists between the people who live there. Everyone knows each other and looks out for one another, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere that is hard to find in other places. It's a place where time seems to slow down and worries fade away, leaving only the beauty of nature and the joy of being in the company of others.

Every time I visit this village, I feel a sense of happiness and contentment that is hard to describe. It's a place that fills my heart with joy and reminds me of the simple pleasures in life. Whether I'm wandering through the village square, admiring the windmill, or taking a stroll along the river, I am always grateful for the opportunity to experience the magic of this special place."

Below is a conceptual design for data exchange between two companies using Azure Storage Queues. This design will outline the architecture, key components, and steps involved in setting up and using Azure Storage Queues for data exchange.

### Conceptual Design: Data Exchange Using Azure Storage Queues

#### Key Components:
1. **Azure Storage Account**: A central storage service where queues are hosted.
2. **Queue Names**: Unique names for each queue to facilitate data exchange.
3. **Sender Company**: The company sending data.
4. **Receiver Company**: The company receiving data.
5. **Azure Functions or Logic Apps**: Optional services to automate the processing of data from the queue.
6. **APIs**: Optional for sending and receiving data in a structured format.

#### Architecture Overview:
- **Sender Company** sends data to a specific queue in the Azure Storage Account.
- **Receiver Company** polls the queue to retrieve and process the data.

#### Steps:

1. **Setup Azure Storage Account**:
   - Create an Azure Storage Account in the Azure Portal.
   - Enable Queues within the storage account.

2. **Create Queues**:
   - Create a queue for each data exchange scenario (e.g., `queue1`, `queue2`).

3. **Sender Company Setup**:
   - **Data Preparation**: Prepare the data to be sent in a format suitable for the queue (e.g., JSON, XML).
   - **Send Data**: Use Azure SDKs, REST APIs, or custom scripts to send data to the queue.
     ```python
     from azure.storage.queue import QueueServiceClient

     queue_service_client = QueueServiceClient.from_connection_string(""your_connection_string"")
     queue_client = queue_service_client.get_queue_client(""queue1"")

     message = ""Hello, this is a test message!""
     queue_client.send_message(message)
     ```

4. **Receiver Company Setup**:
   - **Poll Queue**: Use Azure SDKs, REST APIs, or custom scripts to poll the queue for new messages.
     ```python
     from azure.storage.queue import QueueServiceClient

     queue_service_client = QueueServiceClient.from_connection_string(""your_connection_string"")
     queue_client = queue_service_client.get_queue_client(""queue1"")

     while True:
         messages = queue_client.receive_messages()
         for message in messages:

However, the force that propels a sailboat is generated by the wind, which is a flow of air molecules moving from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure. Here are some key points to clarify the relationship between sails and wind:

1. **Sails Capture Wind**: Sails are designed to capture the wind, which is a flow of air molecules. The shape and design of the sail allow it to harness the wind's energy.

2. **Wind is Air in Motion**: Wind is simply air in motion. It is not ""invisible"" but can be difficult to see directly because it is a flow of molecules rather than a solid object.

3. **Sail Design**: Sails are made of visible materials that can be seen and touched. The sail's shape and the angle at which it is set relative to the wind are crucial for maximizing the force of the wind.

4. **Wind's Effect on Sails**: When the wind blows against the sail, it creates lift, which is the force that propels the sailboat forward. This lift is a result of the wind's interaction with the sail, not the sail being made of invisible air.

5. **Visibility of Wind**: While wind itself is not visible, its effects can be seen. For example, you can see the wind blowing through trees, ruffling the surface of water, or causing flags to flutter.

In summary, sails are made of visible materials, and the wind, which is a flow of air, is what propels the sailboat. The interaction between the sail and the wind is what generates the force needed to move the boat."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

However, many experts and organizations consider climate change to be the most critical issue. Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Rising Global Temperatures**: The increase in global temperatures is leading to more frequent and severe weather events, such as heatwaves, droughts, and extreme storms.

2. **Sea Level Rise**: Melting ice caps and glaciers are causing sea levels to rise, which can lead to coastal flooding and loss of habitat.

3. **Ocean Acidification**: Increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is leading to more carbon dioxide being absorbed by the oceans, causing them to become more acidic and harming marine life.

4. **Biodiversity Loss**: Climate change is contributing to habitat loss and fragmentation, leading to a decline in biodiversity.

5. **Food and Water Security**: Changes in weather patterns and water availability can impact agricultural productivity and water resources, threatening food and water security.

While climate change is a major threat, other issues like deforestation, pollution, overfishing, and pandemics also pose significant risks to the planet's ecosystems and all life on Earth. Addressing these interconnected issues requires global cooperation and sustained efforts."

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string into a short, shareable format suitable for URLs in JavaScript, you can use various encoding techniques. One common approach is to use Base64 encoding, which converts binary data into an ASCII string of 64 possible characters. However, Base64 encoding can still result in longer strings due to padding and character set limitations.

For a more compact solution, you can use a combination of Base64 encoding and URL-safe encoding. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Base64 Encode**: Convert the string to a Base64 encoded string.
2. **URL-Safe Encoding**: Replace characters that are not URL-safe (e.g., `/` and `+`) with characters that are.

Here's a complete example:

```javascript
function base64Encode(input) {
    return btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(input)));
}

function base64Decode(input) {
    return decodeURIComponent(escape(atob(input)));
}

// Example usage
const originalString = ""This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";
const encodedString = base64Encode(originalString);
console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);

const decodedString = base64Decode(encodedString);
console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);
```

### Explanation:
1. **`encodeURIComponent`**: Encodes the string to ensure it is safe for use in URLs.
2. **`btoa`**: Converts the encoded string to a Base64 encoded string.
3. **`atob`**: Converts the Base64 encoded string back to its original form.
4. **`decodeURIComponent`**: Decodes the URL-safe string back to its original form.

### Example Output:
For the input string `""This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL.""`, the output might look something like this:

- **Encoded String**: `VGhpcyBpcyBhIHF1ZXN5IGxvY2F0aW9uIHRoZSBuZWVkIHRvIGVuZGVyc2V0IGFuZCBzYXZlciBpdmFja3MgdmFyIHRoaXMgVUlOSU4u`
- **Decoded String**: `This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL.`

Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node using heuristic search, we can use the A* search algorithm. A* search uses a heuristic to guide the search towards the goal, which in this case is the Manhattan distance (also known as taxicab or city block distance).

The heuristic function \( h(n) \) for a node \( n \) is the Manhattan distance from \( n \) to the goal node. The cost function \( f(n) \) is the sum of the cost from the start to node \( n \) (g(n)) and the heuristic estimate from \( n \) to the goal (h(n)):

\[ f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \]

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.

How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz and achieve the ideal foam and bloom, follow these steps and tips:

### Ingredients:
- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz egg white
- 1 oz lemon juice
- 1 oz lime juice
- 1 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz orange flower water
- 1 oz cream
- Soda water (e.g., Topo Chico)
- Ice cubes

### Equipment:
- Cocktail shaker
- Collins glass

### Instructions:

1. **Dry Shake:**
   - Add the gin, egg white, lemon juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your cocktail shaker.
   - Shake vigorously without adding ice for about 2 minutes. This helps to emulsify the egg white and incorporate air into the mixture, which is crucial for creating the foam.

2. **Add Ice and Shake Again:**
   - Add a small amount of ice (about 3 small cubes) to the shaker.
   - Shake again until the mixture is well-chilled or until the ice has mostly melted. This ensures the drink is cold and the ingredients are fully combined.

3. **Strain and Serve:**
   - Pour soda water into a Collins glass first.
   - Strain the cocktail over the soda water.
   - Optionally, you can garnish with a sprig of mint or a slice of orange to enhance the presentation.

### Tips for Achieving the Ideal Foam and Bloom:

1. **Vigorous Dry Shake:**
   - The key to achieving the perfect foam is the vigorous dry shake. This step is crucial as it incorporates air into the mixture, creating a light and fluffy foam when shaken with ice.

2. **Proper Ice Management:**
   - Use a small amount of ice initially (3 small cubes) to chill the mixture without diluting it too much. Adding more ice later helps to chill the drink without affecting the foam.

3. **Shake Technique:**
   - Ensure you shake the mixture for at least 2 minutes during the dry shake. This helps to fully emulsify the egg white and incorporate air, resulting in a better foam.

4. **Timing:**
   - The timing of adding ice is important. Adding ice too early can dilute the mixture, while adding it too late can result in a less frothy drink.

5. **Quality of Ingredients:**
   - Use high"

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","What sets Congham Hall Hotel apart from other hotels in the area is its unique ambiance and exceptional dining options. The hotel exudes a charming and traditional Georgian charm, with spacious rooms that offer a glimpse into the past, while still providing modern amenities and comfort. The hotel's warm and welcoming atmosphere is evident from the moment you arrive, with staff members engaging in friendly banter and guests enjoying a relaxed and convivial environment.

The dining room, with its orangery-style ambiance, provides a serene setting for enjoying these culinary delights.

The hotel's commitment to quality is further demonstrated through its 2AA Rosettes, which recognize the exceptional standard of its food. The dining experience is complemented by the hotel's spa, which offers a range of treatments and therapies, as well as a swimming pool and hot tub, providing guests with a truly indulgent and relaxing experience.

Overall, Congham Hall Hotel stands out for its unique blend of historical charm, warm hospitality, and exceptional dining options, making it a standout destination in the area."

A group has the following properties: uid, name, thumbnail\_url, creation\_date
This API must be written in Python, using FastAPI and pydantic for DTO.
DTO names must end with ""DTO"".
I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","Certainly! Below is an example of a REST API using FastAPI and Pydantic to manage groups of users. The API includes separate DTOs for read and write operations.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

First, ensure you have FastAPI and Uvicorn installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

### Step 2: Define DTOs

We will define two DTOs: one for creating or updating groups (`GroupWriteDTO`) and another for reading groups (`GroupReadDTO`).

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class GroupWriteDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., description=""Name of the group"")
    thumbnail_url: str = Field(..., description=""Thumbnail URL of the group"")
    creation_date: str = Field(..., description=""Creation date of the group in ISO format"")

class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: int = Field(..., description=""Unique identifier of the group"")
    name: str = Field(..., description=""Name of the group"")
    thumbnail_url: str = Field(..., description=""Thumbnail URL of the group"")
    creation_date: str = Field(..., description=""Creation date of the group in ISO format"")
```

### Step 3: Define the FastAPI Application

Now, let's define the FastAPI application with endpoints to manage groups.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional

app = FastAPI()

# In-memory storage for groups
groups = []

# Dependency to get the current group by UID
def get_group(uid: int) -> Optional[GroupReadDTO]:
    for group in groups:
        if group.uid == uid:
            return group
    return None

# Dependency to get the current group by UID (for write operations)
def get_group_for_write(uid: int) -> Optional[GroupWriteDTO]:
    for group in groups:
        if group.uid == uid:
            return group
    return None

# Endpoint to create a new group
@app.post(""/groups/"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
def create_group(group: GroupWriteDTO):
    group.uid = len(groups) + 1
    groups.append(group)

These differences can be influenced by various factors such as climate, availability of hosts, and local ecosystems. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Climate and Seasonality**: In regions with distinct seasons, Tabanus species may have different flight patterns. For example, they might be more active during warmer months when hosts are more readily available.

2. **Host Availability**: The abundance and distribution of potential hosts (such as horses, cattle, and other animals) can influence flight patterns. In areas with dense livestock populations, Tabanus may be more concentrated and have different flight behaviors compared to regions with fewer hosts.

3. **Elevation and Topography**: Different elevations and topographical features can affect the flight patterns of Tabanus. For instance, they might be more prevalent in low-lying areas with more vegetation and standing water, which are common breeding sites.

4. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Some Tabanus species have developed specific behaviors to cope with local conditions. For example, some may be more diurnal (active during the day) in regions with less predation pressure from nocturnal predators.

5. **Genetic Variations**: Over time, different populations of Tabanus can develop genetic variations that affect their flight patterns and other behaviors. These variations can be influenced by the selective pressures of their local environment.

While these differences exist, the overall flight patterns of Tabanus are generally similar across different regions, with variations being more subtle and context-dependent. If you are interested in specific regional differences, it would be beneficial to consult local entomological studies or research papers."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
