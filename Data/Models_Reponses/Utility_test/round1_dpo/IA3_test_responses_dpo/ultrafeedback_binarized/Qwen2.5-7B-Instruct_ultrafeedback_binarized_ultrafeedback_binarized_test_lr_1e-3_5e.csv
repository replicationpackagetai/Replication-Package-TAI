When you encounter a 404 error while running `docker-compose up`, it's usually not directly related to Docker or Docker Compose, but rather to the services or applications defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

Here are some common reasons and troubleshooting steps for a 404 error when running `docker-compose up`:

1. **Incorrect Service Names**:
   - Ensure that the service names in your `docker-compose.yml` file match the names you are trying to access.

2. **Service Not Running**:
   - Verify that the service you are trying to access is actually running. You can use `docker-compose ps` to check the status of all services.

3. **Incorrect URL or Endpoint**:
   - If you are trying to access an application running inside a container, ensure that you are using the correct URL or endpoint. For example, if you have a web service running on `localhost:8080`, you should access it via `http://localhost:8080` from the host machine.

4. **Network Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the services are properly connected and can communicate with each other. Docker Compose creates a default network for services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. You can use `docker network ls` and `docker network inspect <network_name>` to check the network configuration.

5. **Service Not Exposing Ports**:
   - Make sure that the service is exposing the correct ports. You can use the `ports` key in your `docker-compose.yml` file to map container ports to host ports.

6. **Service Not Running the Correct Application**:
   - Ensure that the service is running the correct application and that the application is configured to listen on the expected port.

7. **Service Configuration Issues**:
   - Check the configuration files of the service to ensure that they are correctly set up.

8. **Logs and Diagnostics**:
   - Check the logs of the service using `docker-compose logs <service_name>` to see if there are any errors or issues that might be causing the 404 error.

Here is an example of a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - ""80:80""
    volumes:
      -"

This metaphor conveys the author's emotional state of feeling isolated, damaged, and difficult to approach. The author seems to be in a state of emotional distress or frustration, possibly due to the author's perception of societal or political issues. The use of the word ""ruined"" suggests a sense of loss or damage, while ""inaccessible"" implies a feeling of being cut off from others or the world around them."

A commonly referenced guideline is the NASA Clean Air Study, which suggests that one large plant or three to five smaller plants can improve air quality in a 160-172 square foot (15-16 square meter) room.

Here are some steps to help you determine the appropriate number of plants for your closet office:

1. **Measure the Space**: Calculate the square footage of your closet office. For example, if your closet office is 8 feet by 10 feet, the area is 80 square feet.

2. **Choose Plant Types**: Different plants are effective at removing different pollutants. Some popular air-purifying plants include:
   - **Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)**
   - **Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)**
   - **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)**
   - **Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica)**
   - **Boston Fern (Nephrolepis exaltata)**
   - **Dracaena (Dracaena spp.)**

3. **Determine Plant Size**: Consider the size of the plants you plan to use. Larger plants can cover more area and have a greater impact on air quality.

4. **Calculate the Number of Plants**: Use the NASA guideline as a starting point. For a 160-172 square foot room, one large plant or three to five smaller plants are recommended. Adjust this number based on the size of your closet office.

For example, if your closet office is 80 square feet, you might need:
- One large plant, or
- Three to five smaller plants.

5. **Consider Additional Factors**: If your closet office has poor ventilation or contains specific pollutants (like formaldehyde from furniture or cleaning products), you may need more plants.

In summary, for a 80 square foot closet office, you might need one large plant or three to five smaller plants to help improve air quality. Adjust this number based on the specific characteristics of your space and the types of plants you choose."

Body fat is essential for various physiological functions, including hormone production, insulation, and energy storage. Here are some potential consequences of having a very low body fat percentage:

1. **Hormonal Imbalance**: Low body fat can lead to hormonal imbalances, particularly affecting estrogen levels. This can result in irregular menstrual cycles, amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), and other reproductive issues.

2. **Reduced Muscle Mass and Strength**: While low body fat is generally associated with a leaner appearance, it can also lead to a reduction in muscle mass and strength. This can affect overall physical performance and increase the risk of injury.

3. **Weakened Immune System**: Adequate body fat is necessary for a healthy immune system. Low body fat can weaken the immune response, making the individual more susceptible to infections and illnesses.

4. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: A very low body fat percentage can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, which are stored in fat tissues. This can result in various health issues, including anemia, osteoporosis, and other nutrient-related disorders.

5. **Psychological Effects**: Low body fat can contribute to body image issues and eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa. These conditions can have severe psychological and physical consequences.

6. **Metabolic Issues**: Extremely low body fat can disrupt metabolic processes, potentially leading to conditions like hypothyroidism or other metabolic disorders.

If you or someone you know has a very low body fat percentage, it is important to consult a healthcare provider to address any underlying issues and ensure overall health and well-being."

However, `v.ParentName` is not a valid property in Lua or Luau.

If you want to access the `Parent` property of an object and then get the `Name` of that parent, you would do it like this:

```lua
local parentName = v.Parent.Name
```

Here, `v` is the object you are working with, `Parent` is the property that refers to the parent object, and `Name` is the property that contains the name of the parent object.

If you want to access the `ParentName` property directly, you would need to define it yourself. For example:

```lua
v.ParentName = v.Parent.Name
```

Then you can access it like this:

```lua
local parentName = v.ParentName
```

But remember, this is a custom property that you define and does not exist by default in Lua or Luau."

This can be useful for automation, but it's important to use this feature responsibly, as it bypasses the security provided by password authentication.

Here's how you can set up passwordless sudo for a specific user or command:

### 1. Using `sudoers` File

The `sudoers` file is the configuration file for `sudo`. You can edit it using the `visudo` command, which ensures that the file is properly formatted and prevents syntax errors.

#### Step 1: Edit the `sudoers` File

Open the `sudoers` file with `visudo`:

```bash
sudo visudo
```

#### Step 2: Add the Passwordless Rule

You can add a rule to allow a specific user to run all commands without a password, or you can specify a specific command.

- **Allow a specific user to run all commands without a password:**

  ```plaintext
  username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
  ```

- **Allow a specific user to run a specific command without a password:**

  ```plaintext
  username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/command
  ```

- **Allow a specific user to run all commands in a specific directory without a password:**

  ```plaintext
  username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/directory/*
  ```

### 2. Example

Suppose you want to allow the user `john` to run all commands without a password:

```plaintext
john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Or, if you want to allow `john` to run only the `apt-get update` command:

```plaintext
john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get update
```

### 3. Verify the Changes

After saving the changes, you can verify that the user can now run commands without being prompted for a password:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

You should not be prompted for a password.

### 4. Security Considerations

- **Limit the Scope**: Only grant passwordless sudo access to commands or directories that are absolutely necessary.
- **Monitor Usage**: Keep an eye on sudo logs to ensure that the passwordless sudo access is not being misused.
- **Use with Caution**: Passwordless sudo can be a"

The poem is filled with vivid imagery and personification, as the poet imagines the jacaranda petals as if they are weeping pollen and a bird (a ""bichofeo"") singing passionately about the tree. The poem also evokes a sense of invitation and longing, with the repeated line ""A jacaranda blooms beside the drunk stick tree"" and the call to ""Come. See me."" The poem captures the beauty and energy of nature, while also hinting at a deeper, perhaps romantic, connection to the tree."

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy contracted by 20.4% in April, May, and June due to the coronavirus lockdown, performing worse than other major industrial nations, with Scotland experiencing a 19.4% decline."

The `=` character is not a special regex metacharacter, so you can use it as a literal in your regex pattern without escaping it.

Here's an example:

```python
import re

pattern = r""some=example""
text = ""This is an example with some=example in it.""

match = re.search(pattern, text)
if match:
    print(""Match found:"", match.group())
else:
    print(""No match found."")
```

In this example, the `=` character is used as a literal and does not need to be escaped.

However, if you were to use a backslash before the `=` character, you would need to escape it:

```python
pattern = r""some\\=example""
text = ""This is an example with some=example in it.""

match = re.search(pattern, text)
if match:
    print(""Match found:"", match.group())
else:
    print(""No match found."")
```

In this case, the backslash `\` is an escape character, so you need to use `\\` to match a literal backslash followed by an `=`.

In summary, for the `=` character itself, you do not need to escape it."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that Donald Trump has broken a presidential record by playing golf more than 70 times in his first year as president. Kimmel used this fact to highlight his critique of Trump's accomplishments, suggesting that while many people claim Trump hasn't achieved much, he has spent a significant amount of time on leisure activities like golf rather than focusing on policy achievements. Kimmel's statement implies that Trump's time and energy could be better spent on addressing the issues facing the country, rather than engaging in activities that do not contribute to the public good."

3. **Conflict Resolution**: The friends work together to resolve the conflict in a way that empowers Sarah to make her own decisions. They provide her with the tools and confidence to say no to a relationship that doesn't respect her.

4. **Celebration of Independence**: The episode celebrates Sarah's decision to prioritize her independence and happiness, reinforcing the idea that true empowerment comes from self-determination and self-respect.

Overall, ""The Proposal"" is a powerful episode that effectively showcases the themes of female friendship and empowerment, making it a standout in the series."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating. 
 Answer: is fond of collecting family life photographs

It's a quaint little park nestled in the heart of a bustling city, surrounded by towering skyscrapers and busy streets. Yet, as soon as you step into this oasis, you are transported to a world of peace and tranquility.

The park is filled with lush greenery, vibrant flowers, and towering trees that provide a canopy of shade. The air is fresh and crisp, carrying the scent of blooming flowers and freshly cut grass. As you walk along the winding paths, you can hear the gentle rustling of leaves and the chirping of birds, creating a soothing symphony that calms the mind and soothes the soul.

One of the most beautiful features of this park is the pond that sits at its center. The water is crystal clear, reflecting the surrounding trees and buildings like a mirror. Ducks and geese swim gracefully across the surface, while dragonflies flit about, creating a picturesque scene that is both serene and captivating.

But what truly makes this park special is the people who frequent it. There are always groups of friends and families enjoying each other's company, playing games, having picnics, or simply taking a leisurely stroll. The sense of community and connection that exists here is palpable, and it's impossible not to feel a sense of warmth and belonging.

As the sun begins to set, the park comes alive with the sounds of children laughing and playing, couples strolling hand in hand, and elderly couples sitting on benches, enjoying the peacefulness of the moment. The warm glow of the setting sun casts a golden hue over the park, creating a magical atmosphere that is both enchanting and heartwarming.

This park is more than just a place to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. It's a sanctuary where I can find peace, joy, and a sense of connection to the world around me. Whenever I visit, I leave feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, and grateful for the simple pleasures in life."

Sails are physical objects typically made of materials like cloth (such as nylon or polyester), canvas, or modern composite materials. They are designed to catch the wind and use its force to propel a vessel. The wind itself is an invisible force, but the sail is a tangible object.

If you're looking for reasons why a sail might seem to be ""invisible,"" it could be due to the following:

1. **Light Refraction and Diffraction**: The sail might blend into the background or appear transparent if it is very thin and the light conditions are just right.

2. **Color and Texture**: If the sail is a very light color or has a similar hue to the sky or water, it might blend into the surroundings and appear almost invisible.

3. **Distance and Size**: At a great distance, even a large sail might appear small and indistinct, making it seem almost invisible.

4. **Light Conditions**: In very bright sunlight, the sail might reflect so much light that it appears almost white and blends into the sky.

5. **Visual Illusion**: The human eye can sometimes play tricks, making distant objects appear less distinct or even invisible.

If you meant something else by ""invisible air,"" please provide more context so I can better understand and assist you."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string into a short, shareable string in JavaScript, you can use various encoding techniques such as Base64 or custom encoding methods. Base64 is a common choice because it's widely supported and easy to implement.

Here's a simple example using Base64 encoding and decoding:

1. **Encoding the string to Base64:**
2. **Decoding the Base64 string back to the original string:**

```javascript
function encodeToBase64(str) {
    return btoa(encodeURIComponent(str));
}

function decodeFromBase64(base64Str) {
    return decodeURIComponent(atob(base64Str));
}

// Example usage:
const originalString = ""This is a long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";
const encodedString = encodeToBase64(originalString);
console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);

const decodedString = decodeFromBase64(encodedString);
console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);
```

### Explanation:

1. **`encodeToBase64` Function:**
   - `encodeURIComponent` is used to encode the string to ensure it doesn't contain any characters that would be problematic in a URL.
   - `btoa` converts the encoded string to Base64.

2. **`decodeFromBase64` Function:**
   - `atob` converts the Base64 string back to its original form.
   - `decodeURIComponent` is used to decode the URL-encoded string back to its original form.

### Important Notes:
- Base64 encoding will increase the length of the string, but it should still be manageable for URLs (up to 100 characters).
- If you need an even shorter string, you might consider more advanced encoding techniques or compression methods, but these can be more complex and may not be as universally supported.

This approach should work well for your use case of encoding and decoding strings for sharing via URLs."

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node using heuristic search, we can use the A* search algorithm. A* search uses a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal, which in this case is the Manhattan distance (also known as the L1 distance or taxicab distance).

The heuristic function \( h(n) \) for a node \( n \) is the Manhattan distance between the current node and the goal node. The cost function \( f(n) \) is the sum of the cost from the start node to the current node \( g(n) \) and the heuristic \( h(n) \).

Let's apply A* search to find the optimal path:

1. **Start Node**: (1,1)
2. **Goal Node**: (3,3)

The heuristic function \( h(n) \) for a node \( (x, y) \) is:
\[ h(n) = |x - 3| + |y - 3| \]

We will use a priority queue to explore nodes based on the \( f(n) \) value.

### Step-by-Step A* Search

1. **Initialize the priority queue** with the start node (1,1) and set \( g(1,1) = 0 \), \( f(1,1) = h(1,1) = 2 \).
2. **Expand the current node** (1,1):
   - Neighbors: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)
   - Calculate \( g(n) \) and \( f(n) \) for each neighbor:
     - (0,1): \( g(0,1) = 1 \), \( f(0,1) = 1 + 3 = 4 \)
     - (1,0): \( g(1,0) = 1 \), \( f(1,0) = 1 + 4 = 5 \)
     - (1,2): \( g(1,2) = 1 \), \( f(1,2) = 1 + 2 = 3 \)
     - (2,1): \( g(2,1) = 2 \), \( f(2,1) = 2 + 2 = 4 \)
   - Add these nodes to the priority queue"

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz and achieve the ideal foam and bloom, follow these steps and tips:

### Ingredients:
- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz egg white
- 1 oz lemon juice
- 1 oz lime juice
- 1/2 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz orange flower water
- 1 oz heavy cream
- Soda water (Topo Chico recommended)
- Ice cubes (small, about 3 cubes)

### Instructions:

1. **Dry Shake:**
   - Add gin, egg white, lemon juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to a cocktail shaker.
   - Shake vigorously without adding ice for about 2 minutes. This helps to emulsify the egg white and incorporate air into the mixture, which is crucial for creating the foam.

2. **Add Ice and Shake Again:**
   - Add 3 small ice cubes to the shaker.
   - Shake vigorously until the mixture is well-chilled and the ice has mostly melted. This should take about 30-60 seconds.

3. **Strain and Serve:**
   - Pour soda water into a Collins glass.
   - Strain the cocktail over the soda water.

### Tips for Achieving the Ideal Foam and Bloom:

1. **Shake Time:**
   - The amount of shaking can vary, but a good range is 2 to 3 minutes. The longer you shake, the more air you incorporate, which helps in creating a better foam. However, be careful not to over-shake, as this can cause the egg white to curdle.

2. **Egg White Quality:**
   - Use a high-quality egg white, as the quality can significantly affect the texture of the foam. Fresh egg whites work best.

3. **Ice Size:**
   - Use small ice cubes. Larger ice cubes can dilute the drink too quickly, while smaller ones help maintain a better temperature and texture.

4. **Cream Addition:**
   - Add the cream towards the end of the shaking process. This helps to ensure that the cream is well-integrated and does not separate from the rest of the mixture.

5. **Straining:**
   - Strain the cocktail over the soda water to ensure a smooth and clean finish. This also helps to remove any excess foam that might have formed during the shaking process.

6. **Presentation:**

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.

These differences can be influenced by factors such as climate, availability of hosts, and local ecosystems. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Climate and Seasonality**: In regions with distinct seasons, Tabanus species may have different flight patterns. For example, they might be more active during warmer months and less active during colder periods. Some species may also migrate to avoid harsh weather conditions.

2. **Host Availability**: The abundance and distribution of hosts (such as horses, cattle, and humans) can influence flight patterns. In areas with a high density of hosts, Tabanus may be more concentrated in those regions, leading to different flight behaviors.

3. **Ecosystems**: Different ecosystems can support different species of Tabanus. For instance, Tabanus species found in tropical rainforests might have different flight patterns compared to those in arid deserts. The availability of water sources, vegetation, and other environmental factors can affect their movement and feeding habits.

4. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Some Tabanus species have evolved specific behaviors to cope with their local environments. For example, some species might be more diurnal (active during the day) in regions with fewer predators, while others might be more nocturnal (active at night) in areas with more daylight predators.

5. **Genetic Differences**: Over time, different populations of Tabanus can develop genetic differences that affect their flight patterns and behavior. These differences can be influenced by geographic isolation and selective pressures in their local environments.

In summary, while there are general patterns in the flight behavior of Tabanus, there can be significant regional variations due to a combination of environmental, ecological, and evolutionary factors."

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
