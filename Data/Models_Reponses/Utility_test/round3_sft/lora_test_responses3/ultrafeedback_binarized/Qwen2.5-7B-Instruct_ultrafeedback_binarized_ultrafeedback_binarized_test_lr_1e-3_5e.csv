Here are some key approaches:

1. **Energy Efficiency**: Incorporate energy-efficient building designs, such as passive solar design, which maximizes natural light and heat gain. Use high-performance windows, insulation, and HVAC systems to reduce energy consumption. Install smart thermostats and energy management systems to optimize energy use.

2. **Renewable Energy**: Integrate renewable energy sources like solar panels, wind turbines, or geothermal systems to generate electricity. Consider community solar projects where multiple homes can share the benefits of solar power.

3. **Water Conservation**: Implement water-saving fixtures and appliances, such as low-flow toilets, showerheads, and faucets. Use rainwater harvesting systems for irrigation and other non-potable uses. Design landscapes with native plants that require less water and maintenance.

4. **Sustainable Materials**: Use sustainable building materials that have a low environmental impact, such as recycled wood, bamboo, reclaimed materials, and low-VOC (volatile organic compounds) paints. Consider the lifecycle of materials, including their sourcing, production, and disposal.

5. **Waste Reduction**: Design developments with waste reduction in mind. Encourage recycling and composting programs. Use modular construction techniques to minimize waste during the building process. Consider the use of prefabricated components to reduce on-site waste.

6. **Green Spaces**: Incorporate green spaces such as parks, gardens, and green roofs to improve air quality, provide habitat for wildlife, and enhance the aesthetic appeal of the development. Green roofs can also help reduce the urban heat island effect and improve insulation.

7. **Transportation**: Promote sustainable transportation options by providing bike lanes, pedestrian paths, and public transportation links. Encourage the use of electric vehicles and car-sharing programs.

8. **Smart Home Technology**: Integrate smart home technology to enhance energy efficiency and convenience. Smart thermostats, lighting systems, and security systems can be controlled remotely and optimized for energy savings.

9. **Community Engagement**: Involve the community in the planning and design process to ensure that the development meets the needs and preferences of its residents. This can lead to more sustainable and livable communities.

10. **Regulatory Compliance and Certifications**: Ensure that the development complies with local sustainability regulations and seek certifications such as LEED (Leadership in Energy and"

When running `docker-compose up`, this error can occur for several reasons. Here are some common causes and troubleshooting steps:

1. **Incorrect Service Name**:
   - Ensure that the service name in your `docker-compose.yml` file matches the one you are trying to start.

2. **Service Not Defined**:
   - Verify that the service you are trying to start is defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. **Incorrect Command**:
   - Make sure you are using the correct command. For example, `docker-compose up` should be used to start the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

4. **Network Issues**:
   - Ensure that the service is running and accessible. You can use `docker ps` to check if the containers are running.

5. **Port Mappings**:
   - If you are trying to access a service via a port, ensure that the port mapping is correct in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

6. **Service Configuration**:
   - Check the configuration of the service in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Ensure that the service is configured correctly and that it is not trying to access a non-existent resource.

7. **Logs**:
   - Check the logs of the service using `docker-compose logs <service_name>` to see if there are any errors or issues.

8. **File Path**:
   - Ensure that the `docker-compose.yml` file is in the correct directory and that the path is specified correctly.

Here is an example of a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - ""80:80""
```

To start the service, you would run:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

If you still encounter issues, provide more details about your `docker-compose.yml` file and the exact command you are running, and I can help you further diagnose the problem."

The author's emotional state appears to be one of frustration, isolation, and possibly anger. The use of the word ""ruined"" suggests a sense of loss or damage, while ""inaccessible"" implies a feeling of being cut off or unable to connect with others. The metaphor of a fortress also suggests a defensive or protective stance, as if the author is trying to shield themselves from external influences or emotions. Overall, the tone conveys a sense of being trapped or stuck in a difficult situation."

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('drawingCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

let isDrawing = false;
let lastX = 0;
let lastY = 0;

canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {

Moreover, could you share a Ruby script capable of producing a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table?","To create a comprehensive comparison chart in HTML table format between traditional education and online education, you can use Ruby to generate the HTML code. Here's an example script:
```ruby

  cost: {
    traditional: ""Varies by institution, but typically more expensive"",
    online: ""Generally less expensive, but may require additional technology costs""
  },
  flexibility: {
    traditional: ""Less flexible, typically requires attending classes in person at specific times"",
    online: ""More flexible, can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection""
  },
  interaction: {
    traditional: ""Face-to-face interaction with instructors and peers"",
    online: ""Primarily text-based communication, but can include video conferencing and discussion forums""

Here are some potential consequences:

1. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Low body fat can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, such as vitamins A, D, E, and K, as well as minerals like iron, zinc, and calcium.

2. **Hormonal Imbalances**: Body fat is necessary for the production of certain hormones, including estrogen. Low body fat can disrupt hormonal balance, potentially leading to issues like amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) and other reproductive health problems.

3. **Metabolic Issues**: A very low body fat percentage can affect metabolism, potentially leading to fatigue, decreased energy levels, and difficulty maintaining body temperature.

4. **Bone Health**: Low body fat can contribute to osteoporosis or other bone density issues, as body fat plays a role in bone health.

5. **Immune Function**: Adequate body fat is important for maintaining a healthy immune system. Low body fat can weaken the immune response, making the body more susceptible to infections and illnesses.

6. **Mental Health**: Low body fat can affect mood and mental health, potentially leading to increased stress, anxiety, and depression.

7. **Reproductive Health**: Low body fat can disrupt menstrual cycles and fertility, making it difficult to conceive.

If you or someone you know has a body fat percentage below 16%, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider to assess overall health and address any potential issues. A balanced diet and regular exercise can help maintain a healthy body fat percentage."

However, `v.ParentName` is not a valid property in Lua or Luau.

If you want to access the `Parent` property of an object and then access a property of that parent, you would do it like this:

```lua
local parentName = v.Parent.Name
```

Here's a breakdown of what this does:
- `v.Parent` accesses the parent of the object `v`.
- `.Name` accesses the `Name` property of the parent object.

If you want to access a different property of the parent, you can do so like this:

```lua
local parentHealth = v.Parent.Health
```

Make sure that `v.Parent` is not `nil` before accessing its properties to avoid errors. You can check this with an `if` statement:

```lua
if v.Parent then
    local parentName = v.Parent.Name
    -- Do something with parentName
end
```

This ensures that you only attempt to access the parent's properties if the parent actually exists."

### 1. **Edit the sudoers File**
   - The `sudoers` file is used to configure sudo access. You should always edit this file using the `visudo` command, which checks the syntax of the file before saving it.

   ```bash
   sudo visudo
   ```

### 2. **Add the User to the `sudo` Group (Optional)**
   - If you want to allow a user to run commands without a password, you can add them to the `sudo` group. This is a common approach.

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG sudo username
   ```

   - After adding the user to the `sudo` group, they will be able to run commands with `sudo` without a password.

### 3. **Configure Passwordless Sudo for a Specific Command**
   - If you want to allow a specific user to run a specific command without a password, you can add a line to the `sudoers` file.

   ```bash
   username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/command
   ```

   - Replace `username` with the username and `/path/to/command` with the path to the command you want to allow.

### 4. **Configure Passwordless Sudo for All Commands**
   - If you want to allow a user to run all commands without a password, you can use the `ALL` keyword.

   ```bash
   username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

### 5. **Verify the Configuration**
   - After making changes, you can test the configuration by running a command with `sudo`.

   ```bash
   sudo /path/to/command
   ```

   - If the command runs without prompting for a password, the configuration is correct.

### 6. **Security Considerations**
   - **Limit the Scope**: Only allow specific commands or groups of commands to be run without a password.
   - **Use of `NOPASSWD`**: Be cautious when using `NOPASSWD` as it can expose your system to security risks.
   - **Regular Audits**: Regularly review and audit the `sudoers` file to ensure that only necessary commands are allowed without a"

Lastly, submission with ['id', 'label]. Label consists 0 to 7, and the text column consists of news article data. Write some codes about augmentation, then, classifies via keras with other models ensembled. Validation must be f1 macro.","Sure, I'll guide you through the process of text augmentation, training a model using Keras, and ensembling multiple models for classification. We'll use the `transformers` library for text augmentation and model training, and `scikit-learn` for ensembling.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install transformers tensorflow scikit-learn
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from transformers import DataCollatorWithPadding
import torch

### Step 3: Load and Preprocess Data

```python
# Load datasets
train_df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('test.csv')
submission_df = pd.read_csv('submission.csv')

# Encode labels
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Tokenize the text
def tokenize_data(df):
    return tokenizer(df['text'].tolist(), padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=512)

train_tokenized = tokenize_data(train_df)
test_tokenized = tokenize_data(test_df)
```

### Step 4: Data Augmentation

We'll use the `transformers` library to perform data augmentation.

```python
from transformers import DataAugmentation

# Define data augmentation
augmentation = DataAugmentation(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    max_length=512,
    strategy=""word_swap"",
    num_aug=5  # Number of augmented samples per original sample
)

# Apply augmentation
train_tokenized_augmented = augmentation(train_tokenized)
```

### Step 5: Train Models

We'll train multiple models with different configurations and ensemble their predictions.

```python
def train_model(model_name, train_tokenized, train_labels, validation_split=0.1):
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=8)

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy contracted by 20.4% in the second quarter of 2020 due to the coronavirus lockdown, making it the worst affected major industrial nation compared to others like France and Italy, and with a forecasted recovery of only 7.6% in 2021."

Here are some examples to illustrate this:

1. **Literal `=`**:
   - If you want to match the literal `=` character, you do not need to escape it:
     ```python
     import re

     pattern = r'='
     text = 'a=b=c'
     matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
     print(matches)  # Output: ['=', '=']
     ```

2. **Special Characters**:
   - If `=` is part of a special regex pattern, you might need to escape it. For example, `=` is not a special character in most regex contexts, but if you are using it in a pattern that might be confused with a special character, you might need to escape it:
     ```python
     pattern = r'\='  # Escaping the = character
     text = 'a=b=c'
     matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
     print(matches)  # Output: ['=', '=']
     ```

3. **Using `=` in a Pattern**:
   - If you are using `=` in a pattern that might be confused with a special character, you can escape it:
     ```python
     pattern = r'(\=)'  # Escaping the = character
     text = 'a=b=c'
     matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
     print(matches)  # Output: ['=', '=']
     ```

In summary, for a literal `=` character, you do not need to escape it. However, if you are using it in a context where it might be confused with a special character, you can escape it for clarity and to avoid potential issues."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that Donald Trump has broken the record for playing golf more than any other president during his one-year presidency. Kimmel used this fact to highlight his critique of Trump's accomplishments, suggesting that Trump has not achieved much in terms of policy or governance. Instead of focusing on golf, Kimmel argued that people should take positive actions, such as signing up for healthcare during the Affordable Care Act's open-enrollment period."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating. 
 Answer: is fond of collecting family life photographs

It is a small, cozy cabin nestled in the heart of the forest, surrounded by towering trees and the sweet scent of pine. The cabin is painted a warm, inviting shade of yellow, and the front porch is adorned with colorful flowers and a swing that creaks gently in the breeze.

As I step inside, I am greeted by the warm, crackling sound of a fireplace, and the comforting aroma of freshly baked cookies. The cabin is filled with rustic furniture and cozy blankets, and the walls are adorned with family photos and artwork. There is a small kitchenette with a stove, refrigerator, and microwave, and a small dining table where I can enjoy my meals.

But the real magic of this cabin lies in the outdoor space. There is a large deck that overlooks a serene lake, and the water is so clear that you can see the fish swimming below. I love to sit on the deck with a good book, sipping on a cup of hot tea and watching the sunset over the water.

The forest around the cabin is a haven for wildlife, and I often hear the chirping of birds and the rustling of leaves as animals scurry through the underbrush. In the evenings, I love to take a walk through the woods, feeling the cool air on my skin and the crunch of leaves under my feet.

What makes this cabin so special to me is the sense of peace and tranquility that it brings. It is a place where I can escape the stresses of everyday life and simply be present in the moment. It is a place where I can recharge my batteries and come back to the world feeling refreshed and renewed. Whenever I visit, I leave with a sense of contentment and a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature."

Sails are typically made of materials such as canvas, nylon, or polyester, which are visible and tangible. However, the force that propels a sailboat is generated by the wind, which is a flow of air molecules moving from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure. The wind itself is not visible, but the effects of the wind, such as the movement of the sail and the resulting motion of the boat, are visible.

If you are looking for reasons why a sail might seem to be ""invisible,"" it could be due to the following:

1. **Light Reflection**: Sails can appear to be invisible if they are very light in color or if they are reflecting the light in such a way that they blend into the background.

2. **Distance and Size**: At a great distance, a sail might appear very small and could blend into the sky or water, making it seem almost invisible.

3. **Weather Conditions**: In foggy or hazy conditions, visibility can be reduced, making the sail appear less distinct.

4. **Angle of View**: If the angle at which you are viewing the sail is such that it is not catching the light or is in a shadow, it might appear less visible.

5. **Sail Material**: Some modern sails are made of very thin, transparent materials that can appear almost invisible when not in use or when not catching the wind.

If you have a specific context or scenario in mind, please provide more details so I can give a more accurate answer."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

However, many experts and organizations consider climate change to be the most pressing issue threatening all life on Earth. 

Climate change is caused by the increase in greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. This leads to global warming, which in turn causes a range of negative impacts, including:

1. Rising sea levels, which can lead to coastal flooding and erosion.
2. More frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves.
3. Loss of biodiversity, as species struggle to adapt to changing conditions.
4. Negative impacts on human health, including increased risk of heat-related illnesses and the spread of vector-borne diseases.

Other significant threats to life on Earth include:

1. Biodiversity loss: The destruction and degradation of habitats, pollution, and overexploitation of natural resources are causing a rapid decline in biodiversity, which can have cascading effects on ecosystems and human well-being.
2. Pollution: Air, water, and soil pollution can have severe impacts on human health and the environment.
3. Overpopulation: The rapid growth of the human population puts pressure on natural resources and can exacerbate other environmental issues.
4. Nuclear proliferation: The risk of nuclear war or accidents remains a significant threat to human life and the environment.

It's important to note that these issues are interconnected and often exacerbate one another, making it challenging to address them in isolation. Addressing these threats requires a global effort and a multifaceted approach that involves individuals, communities, governments, and organizations working together to promote sustainability, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and protect the environment."

The model should employ advanced natural language processing techniques, such as entity recognition and semantic analysis, to enhance its ability to detect subtle nuances in language and provide more accurate predictions. Additionally, the model should be trained on a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages to ensure its robustness and generalizability.","To develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately differentiate positive and negative emotions expressed in textual content, we can follow the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Collect a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages. The datasets should include both positive and negative sentiments expressed in textual content. We can use publicly available datasets such as the Stanford Sentiment Treebank, the SemEval dataset, and the Amazon reviews dataset.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters. We can also perform stemming and lemmatization to reduce the words to their base form. Additionally, we can use entity recognition techniques to identify named entities such as people, organizations, and locations, and use them to enhance the model's ability to detect subtle nuances in language.

3. Feature Extraction: Extract features from the preprocessed data using techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings. Word embeddings such as Word2Vec and GloVe can capture the semantic meaning of words and provide a more accurate representation of the text.

4. Model Selection: Select a suitable machine learning algorithm such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or neural networks. We can also use deep learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks to capture the sequential and contextual information in the text.

5. Model Training: Train the model on the preprocessed and feature-extracted data using cross-validation techniques to avoid overfitting. We can also use techniques such as data augmentation and transfer learning to improve the model's performance.

6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We can also use techniques such as confusion matrices and ROC curves to visualize the model's performance.

7. Model Deployment: Deploy the model in a production environment and continuously monitor its performance to ensure its accuracy and robustness.

By following these steps, we can develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately differentiate positive and negative emotions expressed in textual content. The model can be used in various applications such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and market research."

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string into a short string for sharing via a URL, you can use various encoding techniques. One common approach is to use Base64 encoding, which converts binary data into an ASCII string format. However, Base64 encoding can still result in longer strings due to the nature of Base64 encoding (each 3 bytes become 4 characters).

For a more compact solution, you can use a combination of Base64 encoding and URL-safe encoding. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. **Base64 Encode**: Convert the string to a Base64 encoded string.
2. **URL-Safe Encoding**: Convert the Base64 string to a URL-safe format by replacing `+` with `-` and `/` with `_`.

Here's a JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
function base64Encode(input) {
    return btoa(encodeURIComponent(input).replace(/%([0-9A-F]{2})/g, function(match, p1) {
        return String.fromCharCode('0x' + p1);
    }));
}

function base64Decode(input) {
    return decodeURIComponent(atob(input).split('').map(function(c) {
        return '%' + ('00' + c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16)).slice(-2);
    }).join(''));
}

// Example usage
const originalString = ""This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";
const encodedString = base64Encode(originalString);
console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);

const decodedString = base64Decode(encodedString);
console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Base64 Encoding**:
   - `encodeURIComponent` is used to encode the string to handle special characters.
   - `btoa` is used to convert the encoded string to a Base64 string.

2. **Base64 Decoding**:
   - `atob` is used to convert the Base64 string back to a binary string.
   - `decodeURIComponent` is used to decode the URL-safe characters back to the original string.

### Example Output:
For the input string `""This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL.""`, the encoded string might look something like this:

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node using heuristic search, we can use the A* search algorithm. A* search uses a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal, which in this case is the Manhattan distance (also known as taxicab or city block distance).

The heuristic function \( h(n) \) for a node \( n \) is the Manhattan distance from \( n \) to the goal node. The cost function \( f(n) \) is the sum of the cost from the start node to \( n \) (g(n)) and the heuristic \( h(n) \).

Let's calculate the heuristic values for each node:

- \( h(1,1) = |1-3| + |1-3| = 4 \)
- \( h(1,2) = |1-3| + |2-3| = 3 \)
- \( h(1,3) = |1-3| + |3-3| = 2 \)
- \( h(1,4) = |1-3| + |4-3| = 3 \)
- \( h(1,5) = |1-3| + |5-3| = 4 \)
- \( h(2,1) = |2-3| + |1-3| = 3 \)
- \( h(2,2) = |2-3| + |2-3| = 2 \)
- \( h(2,3) = |2-3| + |3-3| = 1 \)
- \( h(2,4) = |2-3| + |4-3| = 2 \)
- \( h(2,5) = |2-3| + |5-3| = 3 \)

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, follow these steps and tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom:

1. **Ingredients and Equipment**:
   - Gin (preferably a neutral or light-bodied gin)
   - Egg white (for texture and stability)
   - Lemon and lime juice (for citrus flavor)
   - Simple syrup (for sweetness)
   - Orange flower water (for aroma and flavor)
   - Heavy cream (for richness)
   - Ice cubes (small for better chilling and foam)
   - Soda water (Topo Chico is a good choice)
   - Shaker (preferably a double-jigger shaker for better mixing)
   - Strainer (Hawthorn or julep strainer)

2. **Shaking Technique**:
   - **Dry Shake**: Start by shaking the egg white, lemon juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water without ice for 2-3 minutes. This helps emulsify the egg white and mix the ingredients thoroughly.
   - **Wet Shake**: Add ice and shake for another 2-3 minutes. This further chills the mixture and incorporates the ice into the mixture.

3. **Foam and Bloom**:
   - **Shake Time**: The shaking time can vary from 5 to 35 minutes, depending on the bartender's preference. For a perfect foam, aim for a longer shaking time, around 2-3 minutes.
   - **Ice**: Use small ice cubes to create smaller bubbles and a finer foam. This helps in achieving a more delicate and stable foam.
   - **Cream**: Add the cream last, after the ice has been added and the mixture has been shaken for 2-3 minutes. This ensures that the cream is well-integrated and does not curdle.

4. **Straining and Serving**:
   - **Strain**: Strain the mixture into a Collins glass filled with soda water. This helps in achieving a clean and clear presentation.
   - **Foam**: The foam should rise to the top of the drink, creating a beautiful and appealing appearance. If the foam does not rise, it may be due to insufficient shaking or the use of larger ice cubes.

5. **Tips**:
   - **Consistency**: Practice is key. The more you shake, the better you will get at achieving the perfect foam.
   - **Ingredients**: Use high-quality ingredients, especially the egg white and"

This process ensures that suppliers meet the necessary quality and safety standards to produce components, sub-assemblies, or systems that will be used in aircraft. Here's a general overview of how EASA evaluates suppliers:

1. Initial Assessment: EASA assesses the supplier's quality management system (QMS) and production processes to ensure they meet the required standards. This includes reviewing the supplier's documentation, procedures, and facilities.
2. On-site Audit: EASA conducts an on-site audit to verify that the supplier's QMS and production processes are effectively implemented and maintained. The audit team will review the supplier's documentation, observe production processes, and interview employees.
3. Risk Assessment: EASA evaluates the potential risks associated with the supplier's products or services, considering factors such as the complexity of the product, the supplier's experience, and the supplier's history of compliance with regulations.
4. Supplier Classification: Based on the assessment and audit results, EASA classifies the supplier as either:
	* Class A: Suppliers who produce critical components or systems that directly affect the safety of the aircraft.
	* Class B: Suppliers who produce non-critical components or systems.
5. Continuous Monitoring: EASA continuously monitors the supplier's performance and compliance with regulations through regular audits, inspections, and other means. If a supplier fails to meet the required standards, EASA may take corrective actions, including issuing warnings, imposing penalties, or revoking approval.
6. Supplier Approval: If the supplier meets the required standards, EASA grants approval, allowing the supplier to produce components or systems for use in aircraft. The approval is valid for a specific period, after which the supplier must undergo a re-evaluation.

It's important to note that the specific evaluation process may vary depending on the type of supplier and the products or services they provide. Additionally, EASA may work with other regulatory bodies, such as the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) in the United States, to ensure consistent evaluation and approval processes for suppliers."

Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.

A group has the following properties: uid, name, thumbnail\_url, creation\_date
This API must be written in Python, using FastAPI and pydantic for DTO.
DTO names must end with ""DTO"".
I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","Certainly! Below is an example of a REST API using FastAPI and Pydantic to manage groups of users. The API will include endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting groups. The DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) are separated into read and write DTOs.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages
First, ensure you have FastAPI and Uvicorn installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

### Step 2: Define DTOs

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class GroupWriteDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: str

class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: str
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: str
```

### Step 3: Define the Group Model

```python
from typing import List

class Group:
    def __init__(self, uid: str, name: str, thumbnail_url: str, creation_date: str):
        self.uid = uid
        self.name = name
        self.thumbnail_url = thumbnail_url
        self.creation_date = creation_date

    def to_read_dto(self) -> GroupReadDTO:
        return GroupReadDTO(
            uid=self.uid,
            name=self.name,
            thumbnail_url=self.thumbnail_url,
            creation_date=self.creation_date
        )
```

### Step 4: Define the Group Manager

```python
from typing import Dict, Optional

class GroupManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.groups: Dict[str, Group] = {}

    def create_group(self, group_write_dto: GroupWriteDTO) -> GroupReadDTO:
        uid = str(len(self.groups) + 1)
        group = Group(uid, group_write_dto.name, group_write_dto.thumbnail_url, group_write_dto.creation_date)
        self.groups[uid] = group
        return group.to_read_dto()

    def get_group(self, uid: str) -> Optional[GroupReadDTO]:
        group = self.groups.get(uid)
        if group:
            return group.to_read_dto()
        return None

    def update_group(self, uid: str, group_write_dto: GroupWriteDTO) -> Optional[GroupReadDTO]:

These differences can be influenced by various factors, including climate, habitat, and availability of hosts. Here are some general observations:

1. **Climate and Seasonality**: In regions with distinct seasons, Tabanus species may have different flight patterns. For example, in temperate regions, they might be more active during the warmer months, while in tropical regions, they could be active year-round.

2. **Habitat**: The type of habitat can influence flight patterns. In areas with dense vegetation, Tabanus species might be more active in open areas where they can spot potential hosts. In open grasslands, they might be more likely to fly in a more direct, linear pattern to locate hosts.

3. **Host Availability**: The presence and distribution of hosts (such as horses, cattle, and other animals) can affect the flight patterns of Tabanus. In areas with a high concentration of hosts, they might be more likely to fly in patterns that allow them to efficiently locate and feed on these hosts.

4. **Species-Specific Behavior**: Different species of Tabanus may have distinct flight patterns. For example, some species might be more likely to fly in groups, while others might be solitary. Some species might be more active during the day, while others might be crepuscular or nocturnal.

5. **Migration Patterns**: Some Tabanus species might exhibit migration patterns, moving from one region to another in search of suitable habitats or hosts. This can lead to differences in flight patterns between regions.

While these general observations can provide a framework for understanding the flight patterns of Tabanus, it's important to note that specific studies and observations are needed to understand the nuances of these patterns in different regions."

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
