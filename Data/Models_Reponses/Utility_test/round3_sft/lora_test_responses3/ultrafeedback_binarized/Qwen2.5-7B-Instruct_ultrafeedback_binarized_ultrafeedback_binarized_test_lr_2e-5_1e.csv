When you encounter a 404 error while running `docker-compose up`, it could be due to several reasons. Here are some common causes and troubleshooting steps:

1. **Incorrect Service Name**:
   - Ensure that the service name you are trying to start exists in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     services:
       web:
         image: nginx
     ```

2. **Incorrect Command**:
   - Double-check the command you are using. The correct command is `docker-compose up` (without any service name unless you want to start a specific service).
   - Example:
     ```sh
     docker-compose up
     ```

3. **File Path**:
   - Ensure that the `docker-compose.yml` file is in the correct directory or provide the full path to the file.
   - Example:
     ```sh
     docker-compose -f /path/to/docker-compose.yml up
     ```

4. **Service Configuration**:
   - Check if the service configuration is correct and complete. Missing or incorrect configurations can cause issues.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     services:
       web:
         image: nginx
         ports:
           - ""80:80""
     ```

5. **Network Issues**:
   - Ensure that the network configuration in your `docker-compose.yml` is correct and that the services can communicate with each other.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     networks:
       backend:
         driver: bridge
     services:
       web:
         image: nginx
         networks:
           - backend
     ```

6. **Build Context**:
   - If you are building images, ensure that the build context is correct and that the necessary files are present.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     services:
       web:
         build: .
         ports:
           - ""80:80""
     ```

7. **Logs and Output**:
   - Check the output of `docker-compose up` for any additional error messages or clues.
   - Example:
     ```sh
     docker-compose up --verbose
     ```

8. **Permissions**:
   - Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the files and directories involved.

9. **Docker Compose Version**:
   - Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Docker"

The author's emotional state appears to be one of isolation and frustration. The use of the word ""ruined"" suggests a sense of loss or damage, while ""inaccessible"" implies a feeling of being cut off or unable to connect with others or the outside world. This metaphor of a ruined fortress could also symbolize a sense of defeat or the collapse of something once strong or valuable. Overall, the imagery evokes a mood of desolation and a struggle against external forces that prevent the speaker from fully expressing themselves or engaging with their surroundings."

Here are some guidelines to help you determine the appropriate number of plants:

1. **Space Size**: Measure the square footage of your closet office. A general rule of thumb is to have one large plant or three small plants for every 100 square feet (9.3 square meters) of space.

2. **Types of Plants**: Some plants are more effective at removing certain pollutants. Commonly recommended plants include:
   - **Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)**: Good for removing formaldehyde and xylene.
   - **Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)**: Effective at removing formaldehyde, xylene, and trichloroethylene.
   - **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)**: Removes benzene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, xylene, and ammonia.
   - **Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica)**: Good for removing formaldehyde and xylene.

3. **Lighting**: Ensure your closet office has adequate light for the plants to thrive. Some plants require more light than others.

4. **Air Quality Concerns**: If you have specific air quality concerns, such as high levels of formaldehyde or benzene, you may need more plants or specific types of plants.

### Example Calculation
- If your closet office is 100 square feet (9.3 square meters), you would need 1 large plant or 3 small plants.
- If it's 200 square feet (18.6 square meters), you would need 2 large plants or 6 small plants.

### Additional Tips
- **Air Purifiers**: Consider using an air purifier in conjunction with plants for better air quality.
- **Maintenance**: Regularly clean the leaves and ensure the plants are watered and fertilized as needed.
- **Ventilation**: Ensure the closet office has proper ventilation to help with air circulation.

By following these guidelines, you can determine the appropriate number of plants to improve the air quality in your closet office."

1. **Menstrual Irregularities or Amenorrhea**: Low body fat can disrupt the hormonal balance necessary for regular menstrual cycles. This can lead to amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) or other menstrual irregularities.

2. **Decreased Fertility**: Low body fat can affect ovulation and overall fertility. It may be more difficult to conceive if the body does not have enough fat to support the hormonal changes needed for pregnancy.

3. **Bone Density Loss**: Low body fat can contribute to a decrease in bone density, increasing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.

4. **Muscle Fatigue and Weakness**: The body needs a certain amount of fat to support muscle function and recovery. Very low body fat can lead to muscle fatigue and weakness.

5. **Immune System Function**: Fat plays a role in the production of certain immune cells and hormones. Low body fat can weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections and illnesses.

6. **Nutrient Deficiencies**: Low body fat can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, such as vitamins A, D, E, and K, which are fat-soluble and require adequate fat intake for absorption.

7. **Psychological Effects**: Low body fat can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and body image issues, especially if it is the result of extreme dieting or disordered eating.

8. **Metabolic Issues**: Very low body fat can affect metabolism, potentially leading to slower metabolic rates and difficulty maintaining energy levels.

If you or someone you know is concerned about having a very low body fat percentage, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to discuss healthy ways to maintain a balanced body composition."

20. What's is the sum of the squares of all factors of 210?","To find the sum of the squares of all factors of 210, we first need to determine its prime factorization and then use properties of divisors and their squares.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 210
\[ 210 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \]

### Step 2: List All Factors
The factors of 210 can be generated from its prime factorization. The factors are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, 210 \]

### Step 3: Sum of Squares of Factors
To find the sum of the squares of all factors, we use the property that if \( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} \), then the sum of the squares of the divisors of \( n \) is given by:
\[ \sigma_2(n) = (1 + p_1^2 + p_1^4 + \cdots + p_1^{2e_1})(1 + p_2^2 + p_2^4 + \cdots + p_2^{2e_2}) \cdots (1 + p_k^2 + p_k^4 + \cdots + p_k^{2e_k}) \]

For \( n = 210 = 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 \), we have:
\[ \sigma_2(210) = (1 + 2^2)(1 + 3^2)(1 + 5^2)(1 + 7^2) \]

### Step 4: Calculate Each Term
Calculate each term in the product:
\[ 1 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 \]
\[ 1 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10 \]
\[ 1 + 5^2 = 1 + 25 = 26 \]
\[ 1 + 7^2 = 1 +"

However, `v.ParentName` is not a valid syntax in Lua.

If you want to access the `Parent` property of an object `v` and then access a property of that parent, you would do it like this:

```lua
local parentName = v.Parent.Name
```

Here's a breakdown of what this does:
- `v.Parent` accesses the parent of the object `v`.
- `.Name` accesses the `Name` property of the parent object.

If you want to set the `Name` property of the parent, you would do it like this:

```lua
v.Parent.Name = ""NewName""
```

Make sure that `v` has a parent before trying to access `v.Parent`, otherwise `v.Parent` will be `nil`, and you'll get an error if you try to access its properties. You can check if `v.Parent` is `nil` like this:

```lua
if v.Parent then
    v.Parent.Name = ""NewName""
end
```

This ensures that you only attempt to access the `Name` property if `v.Parent` is not `nil`."

This can be useful for automation and scripting, but it's important to use this feature carefully to avoid security risks.

Here's how you can set up passwordless sudo for a specific user or command:

### 1. **Edit the sudoers File**
   The sudoers file is the configuration file for sudo. You need to edit this file to allow passwordless sudo for a specific user or command.

   - **Using `visudo`:**
     The `visudo` command is recommended because it checks the syntax of the sudoers file before saving it, which helps prevent syntax errors that could lock you out of sudo.

     ```sh
     sudo visudo
     ```

   - **Adding a Rule:**
     You can add a rule to allow a specific user to run all commands without a password. For example, to allow the user `john` to run all commands without a password, you would add the following line:

     ```sh
     john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
     ```

     Alternatively, if you want to allow a specific command, you can specify the command instead of `ALL`:

     ```sh
     john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/command_name
     ```

### 2. **Verify the Configuration**
   After adding the rule, save and exit the editor. You can verify that the rule is correctly configured by attempting to run a command with sudo:

   ```sh
   sudo -l -U john
   ```

   This command lists the privileges for the user `john`. If the rule is correctly configured, you should see the command or all commands listed without a password prompt.

### 3. **Security Considerations**
   - **Limit the Scope:** Only grant passwordless sudo access to commands or groups of commands that are necessary. Avoid granting `ALL` access unless absolutely necessary.
   - **Use Specific Users:** Ensure that the rule is specific to the user who needs it. Do not use `ALL` for the user field unless you want to allow the user to run any command as any user.
   - **Regular Audits:** Regularly review the sudoers file and the commands that are run with sudo to ensure that they are still necessary and secure.

### 4. **Example of a More Specific Rule**
   If you only want to allow"

Lastly, submission with ['id', 'label]. Label consists 0 to 7, and the text column consists of news article data. Write some codes about augmentation, then, classifies via keras with other models ensembled. Validation must be f1 macro.","Sure, let's break down the task into several steps:

1. **Data Augmentation**: We can use techniques like text transformation (e.g., adding noise, synonyms, etc.) to augment the training dataset.
2. **Model Training**: We will train several models using Keras and ensemble their predictions.
3. **Validation**: We will use F1 macro as the validation metric.

Here's a step-by-step implementation:

### Step 1: Data Augmentation

We can use the `textattack` library for text augmentation. First, install it if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install textattack
```

Now, let's write the code for data augmentation:

```python
import pandas as pd
from textattack.augmentation import Augmenter
from textattack.transformations import WordSwapRandomSwap
from textattack.attack_recipes import TextFoolerJin2020

# Load the dataset
train_df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('test.csv')

# Define the augmentation recipe
transformation = WordSwapRandomSwap()
attack_recipe = TextFoolerJin2020(transformation=transformation)

# Create an augmenter
augmenter = Augmenter(attack_recipes=[attack_recipe], transformations_per_example=5)

# Apply augmentation to the training data
augmented_train_data = []
for idx, row in train_df.iterrows():
    augmented_texts = augmenter.augment(row['text'])
    for augmented_text in augmented_texts:
        augmented_train_data.append({'id': row['id'], 'text': augmented_text, 'label': row['label']})

# Convert to DataFrame
augmented_train_df = pd.DataFrame(augmented_train_data)
```

### Step 2: Model Training and Ensemble

We will train several models and ensemble their predictions. Let's use Keras for this purpose.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy contracted by 20.4% in April, May, and June due to the coronavirus lockdown, performing worse than other major industrial nations, with Scotland experiencing a slighter smaller decline of 19.4%."

Here are some scenarios:

1. **Literal `=`**: If you want to match the `=` symbol literally, you do not need to escape it. For example:
   ```python
   import re

   pattern = r'='
   text = 'a=b'
   match = re.search(pattern, text)
   print(match)  # <re.Match object; span=(2, 3), match='='>
   ```

2. **Special Meaning**: If `=` has a special meaning in a regex pattern (e.g., as a quantifier or a boundary), you need to escape it. For example, `+` is a quantifier that means ""one or more of the preceding element,"" and `=` would be treated as a literal `=` if you escape it:
   ```python
   import re

   pattern = r'\+='
   text = 'a+b=c'
   match = re.search(pattern, text)
   print(match)  # <re.Match object; span=(2, 3), match='+'>
   ```

In summary, you only need to escape `=` if it appears in a context where it would otherwise be interpreted as a special regex character. If you want to match `=` literally, you do not need to escape it."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that Donald Trump has broken a presidential record by playing golf more than 70 times during his first year in office. This statistic serves as a backdrop for Kimmel's critique of Trump's accomplishments, suggesting that while Trump has spent significant time on leisure activities, he has not achieved much in terms of policy. Kimmel implies that Trump's focus on golf is at odds with the expectations for a president to address important issues, such as healthcare reform, which Kimmel himself has been critical of but sees potential in."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

It's a quaint little park nestled in the heart of the city, surrounded by towering skyscrapers and bustling streets. Despite its proximity to the urban chaos, this park is a peaceful oasis, a sanctuary from the noise and stress of everyday life.

As I step into the park, the first thing that strikes me is the lush greenery that surrounds me. The trees are tall and majestic, their branches reaching out to embrace the sky. The leaves rustle gently in the breeze, creating a soothing melody that calms my mind and soothes my soul. The grass is soft and inviting, and I can feel the warmth of the sun on my skin as I take a seat on one of the benches.

The park is filled with people of all ages, enjoying the beauty of nature and each other's company. Children are playing on the swings and slides, their laughter echoing through the trees. Couples are walking hand in hand, lost in each other's eyes. Seniors are sitting on the benches, chatting and sharing stories. It's a place where people come to connect, to relax, and to find a moment of peace in the midst of the chaos.

But what truly makes this park special is the pond in the center. The water is crystal clear, and the fish swim gracefully beneath the surface. The ducks and geese paddle around, their feathers glistening in the sunlight. The pond is surrounded by a path, and as I walk around it, I can't help but feel a sense of wonder and awe at the beauty of nature.

As the day comes to an end, the park transforms into a magical place of light and color. The sun sets behind the trees, casting a warm golden glow over everything. The birds begin to sing their evening songs, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers. It's a moment of pure magic, and I feel grateful to be a part of it.

This park is more than just a place to me. It's a source of happiness, a reminder of the beauty and wonder of the world around us. Every time I visit, I leave feeling refreshed, renewed, and ready to face whatever challenges the day may bring. It's a place that fills my heart with joy and reminds me of the simple pleasures in life."

Sails are typically made of materials such as canvas, polyester, nylon, or other synthetic fabrics. These materials are visible and tangible. However, the force that propels a sailboat is indeed invisible, as it is generated by the wind, which is a form of air movement. Here are some key points to clarify this:

1. **Sail Material**: Sails are constructed from visible, tangible materials like fabric, not air.

2. **Wind**: The wind, which causes the sail to move, is a form of air movement. Air itself is invisible.

3. **Sail Shape and Wind Interaction**: When the wind blows over the sail, it creates different pressures on different sides of the sail, causing it to fill and move. This interaction between the sail and the wind is what propels the boat, but the wind itself is invisible.

4. **Visible Effects**: While the wind is invisible, the effects of the wind on the sail and the boat are visible. You can see the sail fill with wind, the boat move, and the rudder turn.

In summary, sails are made of visible materials, but the wind, which is the force that moves the sail and the boat, is invisible."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

However, many experts and organizations consider climate change to be the most critical issue threatening all life on Earth. Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Rising Global Temperatures**: The Earth's average temperature has been increasing at an alarming rate, leading to more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires.

2. **Sea Level Rise**: Melting ice caps and glaciers are causing sea levels to rise, which can lead to coastal flooding, loss of habitat, and displacement of populations.

3. **Ocean Acidification**: Increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is leading to more carbon dioxide being absorbed by the oceans, causing them to become more acidic and harming marine life.

4. **Biodiversity Loss**: Climate change is contributing to the loss of biodiversity, as species struggle to adapt to rapidly changing conditions.

5. **Extreme Weather Events**: Climate change is making extreme weather events more frequent and intense, leading to more damage to infrastructure, loss of life, and economic disruption.

While climate change is a major threat, other issues such as deforestation, pollution, overfishing, and pandemics also pose significant risks to life on Earth. Addressing these interconnected issues requires global cooperation and sustained efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect ecosystems, and promote sustainable practices."

Additionally, the model should be trained on a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages to ensure its robustness and generalizability.","To develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately differentiate positive and negative emotions expressed in textual content, we can follow the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Collect a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages. The datasets should include both positive and negative sentiments expressed in textual content. We can use publicly available datasets such as the Stanford Sentiment Treebank, the SemEval dataset, and the Amazon product reviews dataset.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters. We can also perform stemming and lemmatization to reduce the words to their base form.

3. Feature Extraction: Extract features from the preprocessed data using advanced natural language processing techniques such as entity recognition and semantic analysis. We can use named entity recognition (NER) to identify named entities such as people, organizations, and locations. We can also use sentiment lexicons to identify positive and negative words in the text.

4. Model Selection: Select a suitable machine learning algorithm for sentiment analysis. We can use supervised learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests. We can also use deep learning algorithms such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

5. Model Training: Train the selected model on the preprocessed and feature-extracted data. We can use cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data.

6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We can also use confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the model.

7. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a production environment where it can be used to analyze the sentiment of new textual content.

To enhance the ability of the model to detect subtle nuances in language, we can use advanced natural language processing techniques such as sentiment lexicons, named entity recognition, and semantic analysis. Sentiment lexicons can help identify positive and negative words in the text, while named entity recognition can help identify named entities such as people, organizations, and locations.

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string into a short, shareable string in JavaScript, you can use various encoding techniques such as Base64 or URL-safe Base64. Base64 encoding is a common method to encode binary data to an ASCII string format. However, Base64 strings can still be quite long, so you might want to use a URL-safe variant of Base64, which uses only safe characters for URLs.

Here's a simple implementation using URL-safe Base64 encoding and decoding:

1. **Install the `btoa` and `atob` functions for URL-safe Base64 encoding and decoding:**

   ```javascript
   function urlSafeBase64Encode(input) {
     return btoa(encodeURIComponent(input).replace(/%([0-9A-F]{2})/g, function toSolidBytes(match, p1) {
       return String.fromCharCode('0x' + p1);
     }));
   }

   function urlSafeBase64Decode(input) {
     return decodeURIComponent(Array.prototype.map.call(atob(input), function(c) {
       return '%' + ('00' + c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16)).slice(-2);
     }).join(''));
   }
   ```

2. **Use these functions to encode and decode your string:**

   ```javascript
   const longString = ""This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";

   // Encode the string
   const encodedString = urlSafeBase64Encode(longString);
   console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);

   // Decode the string
   const decodedString = urlSafeBase64Decode(encodedString);
   console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);
   ```

### Explanation:

- **`urlSafeBase64Encode`**: This function first encodes the input string using `encodeURIComponent` to handle special characters. Then it converts the encoded string to a Base64 string using `btoa`. The `replace` function ensures that the resulting Base64 string is URL-safe by replacing non-safe characters.

- **`urlSafeBase64Decode`**: This function decodes the URL-safe Base64 string back to the original string. It first converts the Base64 string to a binary string using `atob`, then decodes the binary string back to the original string using `decodeURIComponent`.

### Example Output:

```javascript
Encoded String: VG"

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node using heuristic search, we can use the A* search algorithm. A* search uses a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal, which in this case is the Manhattan distance (also known as taxicab or city block distance).

The heuristic function \( h(n) \) for a node \( n \) is the Manhattan distance from \( n \) to the goal node (3,3):
\[ h(n) = |n_x - 3| + |n_y - 3| \]

The cost function \( f(n) \) for a node \( n \) is the sum of the cost to reach \( n \) from the start and the heuristic estimate from \( n \) to the goal:
\[ f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \]
where \( g(n) \) is the cost to reach node \( n \) from the start node.

Let's apply A* search to find the optimal path:

1. **Initialize the open list** with the start node (1,1) and set its \( f \)-value.
2. **Initialize the closed list** as empty.
3. **While the open list is not empty:**
   - **Select the node with the lowest \( f \)-value** from the open list.
   - **If the selected node is the goal node (3,3),** reconstruct the path and return it.
   - **Otherwise, move the selected node to the closed list.**
   - **For each neighbor of the selected node:**
     - **If the neighbor is not in the closed list:**
       - **Calculate the \( g \)-value for the neighbor.**
       - **If the neighbor is not in the open list, or the new \( g \)-value is lower, update the \( g \)-value and set the parent of the neighbor to the selected node.**
       - **Add the neighbor to the open list.**

Let's go through the steps:

1. **Start node (1,1):**
   - \( g(1,1) = 0 \)
   - \( h(1,1) = |1-3| + |1-3| = 4 \)
   - \( f(1,1) = 0 + 4 = 4 \)

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz and achieve the ideal foam and bloom, follow these steps and tips:

### Ingredients:
- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz egg white
- 1 oz lemon juice
- 1 oz lime juice
- 1 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz orange flower water
- 1 oz cream
- Soda water (Topo Chico is recommended)
- Ice cubes

### Equipment:
- Cocktail shaker
- Collins glass

### Instructions:

1. **Dry Shake:**
   - Add the gin, egg white, lemon juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your cocktail shaker.
   - Shake vigorously for about 2 minutes without adding ice. This helps to emulsify the egg white and incorporate air into the mixture, which is crucial for creating the foam.

2. **Add Ice and Shake Again:**
   - Add a small amount of ice (about 3 small cubes) to the shaker.
   - Shake again until the mixture is well-chilled or until the ice has mostly melted. This ensures the drink is cold and the ingredients are fully combined.

3. **Strain and Serve:**
   - Pour soda water into a Collins glass first.
   - Strain the cocktail over the soda water.
   - Optionally, you can use a fine mesh strainer to catch any egg white foam that might have separated.

### Tips for Achieving the Ideal Foam and Bloom:

1. **Vigorous Dry Shake:**
   - The key to achieving the perfect foam is the vigorous dry shake. This step is crucial as it incorporates air into the mixture, which is essential for creating the desired foam.

2. **Proper Shaker Technique:**
   - Use a shaker that is well-sealed to prevent any liquid from spilling out during the shaking process.
   - Shake the mixture as if your life depends on it. The goal is to create a lot of foam and incorporate as much air as possible.

3. **Use Fresh Egg Whites:**
   - Fresh egg whites will produce a better foam than older ones. If you're concerned about using raw eggs, you can use pasteurized egg whites, which are available in many grocery stores.

4. **Adjust the Amount of Ice:**
   - Adding a small amount of ice (3 small cubes) is enough to chill the mixture without diluting it too much. If"

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","What sets Congham Hall Hotel apart from other hotels in the area is its unique ambiance and exceptional dining options. The hotel exudes a charming and traditional Georgian charm, with spacious rooms that offer a glimpse into the past, while still providing modern amenities. The hotel's warm and welcoming atmosphere is evident from the moment you arrive, with staff laughing and chatting in the spa and breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they clear tables.

The hotel's dining options are also a standout feature. The executive chef, James O'Connor, offers a menu that is both innovative and locally sourced, with most ingredients coming from within 20 miles of the hotel. The menu offers delightful twists on fish, meat, and vegetarian dishes, and the use of rare-breed pork, Holkham venison, Cromer crab, and Brancaster oysters adds a unique touch. The hotel's 2AA Rosettes status is well-deserved, and the dining experience is complemented by the hotel's tranquil setting and sumptuous spa facilities.

In summary, Congham Hall Hotel's unique ambiance, locally sourced ingredients, and exceptional dining options make it stand out from other hotels in the area."

A group has the following properties: uid, name, thumbnail\_url, creation\_date
This API must be written in Python, using FastAPI and pydantic for DTO.
DTO names must end with ""DTO"".
I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","Certainly! Below is an example of a REST API using FastAPI and Pydantic to manage groups of users. The API will include separate DTOs for read and write operations.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

First, ensure you have FastAPI and Uvicorn installed. You can install them using pip:

```sh
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

### Step 2: Define DTOs

We'll define two DTOs: one for reading and one for writing.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: str
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: str

class GroupWriteDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
```

### Step 3: Define the Group Model

We'll define a simple model to represent a group.

```python
class Group:
    def __init__(self, uid: str, name: str, thumbnail_url: str, creation_date: str):
        self.uid = uid
        self.name = name
        self.thumbnail_url = thumbnail_url
        self.creation_date = creation_date
```

### Step 4: Create the FastAPI Application

Now, we'll create the FastAPI application with endpoints to manage groups.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional
from datetime import datetime

app = FastAPI()

# In-memory storage for groups
groups = []

# Helper function to get the current date and time
def get_current_date_time() -> str:
    return datetime.now().strftime(""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"")

# Dependency to get the current date and time
def get_current_date_time_dependency() -> str:
    return get_current_date_time()

# Dependency to get the next UID
def get_next_uid() -> str:
    if not groups:
        return ""1""
    return str(int(groups[-1].uid) + 1)

# Dependency to validate the group write DTO
def validate_group_write_dto(group_write_dto: GroupWriteDTO) -> None:
    if not group_write_dto.name:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=""Name is required"")

These differences can be influenced by various factors such as climate, availability of hosts, and local ecosystems. Here are some general observations:

1. **Climate and Seasonality**: In regions with distinct seasons, Tabanus species may have different flight patterns. For example, in temperate regions, they might be more active during the warmer months, while in tropical regions, they could be active year-round.

2. **Host Availability**: The abundance and distribution of hosts (such as horses, cattle, and other animals) can influence flight patterns. In areas with a high density of hosts, Tabanus may be more concentrated in those areas, leading to more frequent flights in those regions.

3. **Elevation**: In mountainous regions, flight patterns can vary with altitude. Higher elevations might have cooler temperatures, which could affect the activity levels and flight patterns of Tabanus.

4. **Vegetation and Habitat**: Different regions have varying types of vegetation and habitats, which can influence the flight patterns of Tabanus. For instance, in forested areas, they might be more active in the open areas where hosts are more likely to be found.

5. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Some Tabanus species have evolved specific behaviors to cope with their local environments. For example, some species might be more active during the day in some regions, while others might be more active at night in others.

While these differences exist, it's important to note that more detailed studies are needed to fully understand the specific flight patterns and behaviors of Tabanus in different regions. Research in entomology and ecology can provide more precise information on these variations."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
