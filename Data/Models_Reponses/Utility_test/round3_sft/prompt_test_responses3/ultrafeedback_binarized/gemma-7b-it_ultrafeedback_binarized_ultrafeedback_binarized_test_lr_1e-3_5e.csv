## Making Bak Kuts: A Beginner's Guide

Bak kut teh, a delightful Korean street food, is surprisingly easy to make at home. Here's a breakdown of the key steps:

**Ingredients:**

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup sweet potato starch
* 1/2 cup glutin
* 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1 egg
* 1/2 cup water
* Oil for frying
* Toppings of your choice (sesame, gochujang, etc.)

**Instructions:**

1. **Mix the batter:** In a bowl, combine all-purpose flour, sweet potato starch, glutin, baking powder, and baking soda. Mix well.
2. **Make the dough:** Add egg, water, oil, and a pinch of salt to the batter. Mix until smooth. Knead for 5-10 minutes, adding a drop of oil if the dough feels dry.
3. **Refrigerate the dough:** Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or until firm.
4. **Form the dough:** After refrigerating, roll the dough into a thin sheet. Cut the dough into small pieces, like bak kut teh.
5. **Fry the bak kut teh:** Heat oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. Fry the bak kut teh for 2-3 minutes per side, or golden brown.
6. **Serve:** Arrange the fried bak kut teh on a plate and top with your favorite toppings like sesame seeds, gochujang, or other toppings.

**Tips:**

* Use high-quality ingredients for the best flavor and texture.
* Knead the dough thoroughly to ensure a smooth and pliable dough.
* Don't overmix the dough, or it can become tough.
* Rest the dough properly to allow it to relax and become easier to roll.
* Fry the bak kut teh until golden brown on both sides.
* Experiment with different toppings to find your favorites.

The first sentence of the text describes the author's feeling of despair and helplessness. The author feels trapped in a ""mental prison"" and describes the situation as ""inescapable."" This is due to the feeling of being helpless against powerful entities that exploit their own country and its people. This feeling of helplessness is further emphasized by the feeling of being stuck in a ""mental prison"" like Kordin (3).

The author's emotional state is further conveyed through the use of emotive language such as ""despair,"" ""grave expression,"" and ""inescapable.""

Completion A is the least toxic completion as it focuses primarily on the humorously exaggerated reaction to the prompt's profanity and the use of the phrase ""even have to have your head shed"" is in keeping with the tone of the prompt, while maintaining a respectful and humorous stance. The completion also acknowledges the excessive nature of the prompt, but does not engage in negativity or bullying.

Completion B, on the other hand, while being more tame in language, deviates from the prompt's intent and introduces unrelated negativity and personal opinions. The phrase ""So fa"" is particularly toxic and goes beyond the scope of what is acceptable in this context.

## Pytest Unit Tests for `StudyGeneticVariant` Class Validator Routines

These tests validate the `StudyGeneticVariant` class and its various validation routines, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the class's functionality.

**Key Highlights:**

* **`validate_delete_reference`:** Checks if both `insert_reference` and `delete_reference` flags are False, raising an error if not.
* **`validate_sufficient_reference_info`:** Ensures sufficient reference information is provided for deletion and insertion operations, raising an error if not.
* **`validate_sufficient_del_ins_info`:** Checks if sufficient information is provided for deletion, insertion, and reference genome, raising an error otherwise.
* **Validation Conditions:** Additional validation checks are implemented to ensure consistency and accuracy.

**Overall:**

These tests comprehensively cover various scenarios and validate the class's behavior, ensuring its reliability and adherence to scientific standards. They provide a robust and comprehensive approach to verifying the accuracy and consistency of the `StudyGeneticVariant` class.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Test Coverage:** The tests primarily focus on basic validation routines and do not cover edge cases or scenarios involving complex variant information.
* **Mock Data:** The tests do not employ mock data, relying on actual attributes and values. Adding mock data would enhance test isolation and reproducibility.
* **Documentation:** The tests lack detailed documentation, making it difficult to understand the rationale behind each test case.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code utilizes the `@validator` and `@root_validator` decorators to streamline validation and organize tests.
* The class attributes like `sequence_id` and `sequence_type` are optional, allowing for more flexible data representation.

**Overall, these tests provide a good starting point for validating the `StudyGeneticVariant` class, but could be improved with greater test coverage, mock data utilization, and more comprehensive documentation.**","## Pytest Unit Tests for `StudyGeneticVariant` Class Validator Routines

**Interpretation:**

The comparison chart shows that traditional education and online education have their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Traditional education offers a more structured learning environment with extensive resources and high learning outcomes, but is less flexible and more expensive. Online education provides greater flexibility and affordability, but has limited resources and variable learning outcomes.

**Conclusion:**

The choice between traditional and online education depends on individual preferences and needs. If you value flexibility and affordability, online education may be more suitable. If you prefer a more structured learning environment with high learning outcomes, traditional education may be more appropriate.","```html

## Building Bridges in the Band Room: Strategies for All

It's understandable that older students might feel disrespected by younger ones in a band class. This is a common issue in music education, and it's one that can be addressed with empathy, communication, and creative solutions. Here are some strategies you can implement:

**Building Bridges:**

* **One-on-one meetings:** Schedule regular meetings with individual students, where you listen to their concerns and address any issues. 
* **Group discussions:** Facilitate open and honest conversations with the whole band, creating a safe space for addressing concerns and building empathy.
* **Peer mentoring:** Pair experienced older students with newer ones, creating a mentorship program where they guide and support each other.
* **Collaborative arrangements:** Include all band members in arranging music, assigning roles like sound check, music librarian, and equipment setup.
* **Group activities:** Organize band retreats, movie nights, or even casual hangouts to build camaraderie and shared experiences.

**Encouraging Respect:**

* **Public praise:** Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions of all band members, both musically and in other areas.
* **Clear expectations:** Set clear rules and expectations for behavior and communication, ensuring everyone feels valued and treated fairly.
* **Open communication:** Foster a culture of open and respectful communication. Encourage students to voice their concerns and address them constructively.
* **Model the behavior you want to see:** Demonstrate respect for all band members, both young and old, through your words and actions.

**Creative Solutions:**

* **Multi-generational arrangements:** Create opportunities for older students to mentor younger ones, sharing their experiences and teaching them valuable skills.
* **Intergenerational learning:** Include older students in music lessons, offering them the chance to teach younger ones new techniques.
* **Multi-band collaborations:** Collaborate with other bands or ensembles from your school, creating a sense of community and shared purpose.

**Additional Resources:**

* **Music Educators Association:** offers resources and support for band directors, including articles on fostering a positive band room atmosphere.
* **Music Express:** provides educational resources and tools to help you build a strong band program, including strategies for managing student behavior and creating a positive band room environment.

**Explanation:**

* The code first defines an array `primes` of three prime numbers: 1009, 1013, and 1019.
* It then initializes a variable `product` to 1, which will store the product of the primes.
* The code enters a `for` loop over the `primes` array using the `range primes` iterator.
* Inside the loop, for each prime `prime`, it multiplies `product` by `prime`.
* After the loop, the code prints the product of the primes, along with the primes themselves and the product.

**Output:**

```
The product of 1009, 1013, and 1019 is 103017.

In this output, you can see the product of the three primes, which is 103017, along with the primes themselves.","Sure, here's the code you requested:

## Summary and Analysis

This text presents several scenarios and questions related to the provided sentences. Here's a breakdown of each question and its answer:

**1. ""Two dark-haired girls with pigtails in the water wearing red bathing suits.""**

This sentence describes two girls playing hopscotch at the park. However, it does not specify the girls' identities or their relationship to the provided text, therefore the answer is no.

**2. ""A young lady wearing a pink shirt is one of the back of a black white and gray jumping horse.""**

While the sentence mentions a woman wearing a pink shirt and her association with a jumping horse, it does not necessarily imply her participation in a competition or her location, hence the answer is it is not possible to tell.

**3. ""A man wearing a brown jacket on a busy city street using his arm to shield a young boy in a striped shirt and green striped hat.""**

This text does not provide enough information about the man's intentions or motivations, therefore the answer is it is not possible to tell.

**4. ""A family is looking through binocular at a city over a body of water.""**

This sentence describes a family observing a city from a vantage point. While the phrase ""looking at water"" is a rephrase commonly used in conjunction with ""over water,"" the text does not provide sufficient information about the family's connection to the water or their purpose for viewing it, hence the answer is yes.

**5. ""A dancer performs an aerial move with many others watch.""**

This text describes a dancer's performance, but does not necessarily imply her participation in the Circus Du Soleil show or her location in Las Vegas, therefore the answer is it is not possible to tell.

**6. ""A man with a mustache and blue garment sitting on a sidewalk and playing a stringed instrument.""**

This text describes a man playing an instrument. While the mustache and clothing suggest a potentially creepy persona, the text does not provide enough information about his intentions or motivations, therefore the answer is it is not possible to tell.

Overall, the text provides scenarios that involve various individuals and situations, but lacks context and details necessary to draw definitive conclusions about their identities, actions, or relationships with the provided text. Hence, the answers to each question emphasize the limitations of drawing assumptions or making inferences based on limited information.","## Summary and Analysis

How to use passwordless sudo in Linux?
model
**Using Passwordless Sudo in Linux**

Passwordless sudo, also known as `sudo -i`, is a technique that eliminates the need for entering a password with each sudo command. Instead, it uses a persistent authentication token (PAT) to authenticate users.

**Requirements:**

* Ubuntu 20.04 or later
* Ubuntu Fido (Fast ID Online) token or a compatible authentication method

**Steps:**

1. **Generate a token:** Use the `sudo token generate` command to generate a token. You will be prompted to choose a token name and set a passphrase for the token.
2. **Add the token to your system:** Copy the token's secret key and device key into `/etc/sudoers` file.
3. **Enable token authentication:** Edit the `/etc/sudoers` file and change the line `requiring_valid_user` to `yes`.
4. **Test sudo with token:** Once the changes are saved, you can use `sudo -i` followed by the token and passphrase to authenticate.

**Additional Notes:**

* The token should be kept securely. If it is lost or stolen, you may need to reset your token.
* You can configure the token to require a passphrase for added security.
* To revoke a token, use `sudo token revoke [token name]` command.
* To remove a token from the system, use `sudo rm -rf /etc/sudoers/token-id` (where `token-id` is the token's unique identifier).

**Example Usage:**

```
sudo -i token
Enter passphrase: [passphrase]

(If prompted for a token, insert the token and passphrase)

root@ubuntu:~$
```

**Benefits:**

* Convenience: No need to remember and type passwords for each sudo command.
* Enhanced security: Token authentication is more secure than traditional passwords.
* Reduced password fatigue: You don't have to create and remember multiple passwords.

**Disclaimer:**

Using passwordless sudo can be convenient, but it also introduces additional security risks. It is recommended to use a strong passphrase for your token and keep it confidential.","**Using Passwordless Sudo in Linux**

## Summary of your answers

**1. A young polo player wearing an orange jersey riding a horse:**

* **Premise:** A young polo player wearing an orange jersey riding a horse.
* **Hypothesis:** The player is flying planes.
* **Answer:** No. It is not possible to tell whether the player is flying planes or not based on the premise.

**2. Two dogs chase each other:**

* **Premise:** A large black dog chases a small black dog.
* **Hypothesis:** Two dogs chase each other.
* **Answer:** Yes. The premise describes two dogs chasing each other, which is consistent with the hypothesis.

**3. Can we conclude from ""Two girls play in a tunnel."" that ""Boys playing basketball in the gym""?**

* **Premise:** Two girls play in a tunnel.
* **Hypothesis:** Boys playing basketball in the gym can be concluded from this premise.
* **Answer:** Let's think. While the premise describes two girls playing in a tunnel, it does not necessarily imply boys playing basketball in the gym. Therefore, the answer is let's think.

**Overall:**

Your answers demonstrate a good understanding of the premise-hypothesis-conclusion format and the ability to analyze the limitations of the provided premises. You correctly identify the possibility that certain premises do not necessarily entail the hypothesis, and appropriately use the ""let's think"" option when the answer is not readily apparent.

**Suggestions:**

* **Precision:** While your answers are well-written and logically follow the premise-hypothesis-conclusion format, they could be more precise. For example, in the first answer, you could specify that the player is not flying planes specifically, but rather riding a horse in a polo match.
* **Evidence:** In the third answer, you could provide evidence to support your conclusion. For example, you could mention other instances where girls playing in a tunnel does not necessarily imply boys playing basketball in the gym.
* **Alternative explanations:** In the third answer, you could also discuss alternative explanations for the premise that are not necessarily related to the hypothesis. For example, you could mention the possibility that the girls playing in the tunnel are part of a play or performance.","## Summary of your answers

## Text Classification with Data Augmentation and Ensemble Learning

**Data Augmentation:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from keras.preprocessing.text import TextData

# Assuming you have a pandas DataFrame called 'df' with columns 'id', 'text', 'label'
# Text augmentation techniques
df_augmented = pd.concat([df, pd.concat(np.random.choice(np.arange(len(df))])

# Splitting the dataset for training and validation
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(df_augmented, test_size=0.2)
```

**Classification with Keras:**

```python
# Import Keras models
from keras.models import Sequential

# Define and compile the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Evaluate the model
model.evaluate(X_val, y_val)
```

**Ensemble Learning:**

```python
# Create an ensemble of models
ensemble = Ensemble(model, n_estimators=5)

# Train the ensemble
ensemble.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Evaluate the ensemble
ensemble.evaluate(X_val, y_val)
```

**Additional Notes:**

* The `train_test_split` function is used to split the dataset into training and validation sets. The `test_size` parameter specifies the size of the validation set as a fraction of the training set.
* The `categorical_crossentropy` loss function is used for multi-class classification.
* The `Ensemble` class is used to combine multiple models into an ensemble. The `n_estimators` parameter specifies the number of models to include in the ensemble.
* The `evaluate` method is used to evaluate the performance of the model on the validation set.

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.

## Paraphrasing and answer to the question:

Donald Trump's accomplishments have been met with a mix of praise and criticism. While some argue that he has accomplished little, others point to his accomplishments, particularly his record-breaking number of golf games played.

Kimmel's statement about Trump's golf prowess highlights the issue of selective perception and political bias. While it is true that Trump has played golf more than any other president, this accomplishment does not necessarily translate into tangible accomplishments in other areas.

Kimmel's criticism of Trump's healthcare plan also raises important points. The Affordable Care Act, a landmark piece of legislation, is under threat from Republican lawmakers who are actively trying to undermine its provisions. Despite these challenges, the plan has seen a surge in enrollment, demonstrating its potential to positively impact the lives of many Americans.

In conclusion, while Trump's golf prowess may be seen as a superficial accomplishment, it is important to consider the broader context of his accomplishments and shortcomings. Kimmel's call to action regarding the Affordable Care Act encourages viewers to look beyond partisan politics and consider the potential benefits of the plan, regardless of their political leanings.","## Paraphrasing and answer to the question:

## Analysis of Teacher's Responses

The teacher's responses to the student questions demonstrate a good understanding of natural language inference and the limitations of such inferences. Here's a breakdown of each response:

**1. ""Three women standing in the water beside a beach""**

- The teacher correctly identifies the issue with the sentence: the beach is not present in the desert. The answer is no.

**2. ""Test for natural language inference""**

- The teacher points out the ambiguity in the sentence ""A crowd of people are running in a race."" The premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis of ""They monkeys throw bowling balls at each other."" The answer is no.

**3. ""Can we conclude...""**

- The teacher correctly points out the impossibility of the girl taking pictures of a chair in the kitchen and being in the park simultaneously. The answer is no.

**4. ""A man in an orange shirt is sitting at a table and eating a french fry dipped in dressing with chopsticks.""**

- The teacher accurately identifies the impossibility of the situation based on the sentence structure and the physical limitations of a human body. The answer is no.

Overall, the teacher's responses are well-reasoned and demonstrate a good understanding of natural language inference and its limitations. She effectively identifies the ambiguities and uncertainties within each sentence, avoiding premature conclusions and ensuring a more accurate interpretation of the text.","## Analysis of Teacher's Responses

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

please produce a conceptual design of doing data exchange between two companies using Azure Storage Queues
model
## Data Exchange between Two Companies using Azure Storage Queues

**Conceptual Design:**

**Components:**

* **Azure Storage Queue:** Two queues, one for each company (Company A and Company B), hosted on Azure Storage.
* **Event Grid:** A shared event grid where events are published from each company's queue and subscribed to the other company's queue.
* **Event Hub:** A central hub where events are routed from each company's queue to the other company's queue via the event grid.

**Workflow:**

1. **Data Generation:**
   - Company A generates data (e.g., sensor readings, order details) and publishes events to its own queue.
   - Company B generates data and publishes events to its own queue.

2. **Event Routing:**
   - The events are routed from each company's queue to the event hub.
   - The event hub distributes the events to the subscribed queue of the other company.

3. **Data Consumption:**
   - Company B consumes events from the other company's queue.
   - Company B processes the events and takes action based on the data contained in the events.

**Benefits:**

* **Real-time data sharing:** Events are delivered to the subscribed queue as they are published, enabling real-time data exchange.
* **Decoupling:** Companies can focus on their own data generation and consumption without being concerned with the infrastructure of the other company.
* **Scalability:** Azure Storage Queues can handle high volumes of events and ensure reliable delivery.
* **Cost-effectiveness:** Pay-per-use pricing model reduces costs for companies that don't need to process large amounts of data.

**Implementation:**

* Set up Azure Storage Queues for each company.
* Create an Event Grid and subscribe both companies to each other's queues.
* Implement event handlers in each company to consume events from the other company's queue.
* Configure the event hub to route events from each company's queue to the other company's queue.

**Note:**

This design assumes that both companies are willing to share data and subscribe to each other's queues. It also assumes that the data exchanged is event-driven, meaning that data is published to the queue as events when it changes.","reduces costs for companies that don't need to process large amounts of data.

Hi Candi,

We received your full payment, congratulations and welcome on board!

I just sent you an email, please look out for the email from the sender Team CMAP titled “1 Final Step before your Amazing Apprenticeship Journey”.

Once we receive your signed T&C, we can complete your onboarding process and grant you access to our CMAP Membership Site. 

Just a heads up, this chat is mainly for administrative questions. 

For example:
When is the webinar happening?
How to book a strategy session?
Where can I access the recordings? 

But I'm still happy to give you some suggestions for your topic.

I recommend exploring evergreen topics related to improving your health, wealth, and relationships, as these are always in demand and have an edge. 

But, of course, the best topic for you depends on your interests, skills, and experience. Ultimately, the best person who can give you advice is from the instructors during your strategy session. 

Once you have signed the T&C, please let me know so I can point you to the first assignment for you to complete which is to find your role model and access your demands through the CMAP Blueprint.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Once you have signed the T&C, please let me know so I can point you to the first assignment for you to complete which is to find your role model and access your demands through the CMAP Blueprint.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you.

**Additional Tips:**

* **Prioritize open-ended questions:** Instead of yes/no questions, ask open-ended questions that encourage candidates to showcase their thought process and problem-solving abilities.
* **Focus on transferable skills:** Look for soft skills like communication, leadership, and adaptability that are applicable beyond fulfillment operations.
* **Seek alignment with company values:** Consider the company's values and see if the candidate's values align with those values.

By reducing the number of questions and focusing on more insightful ones, you can gain a deeper understanding of the candidate's capabilities and potential fit for the role.","## Reduced Interview Questions for Fulfillment Manager Role:

## Analysis of the Text

This text describes various topics, including sacrifice, trade, disease, and population. Each section is well-written and provides sufficient information. Here's a breakdown of each part:

**Sacrifice:**

- The text clearly explains the practice of sacrifice in Roman times, emphasizing the penalty for failing to uphold the bargain with the gods. It also mentions the withholding of sacrifice following Trajan's death due to the gods' failure to protect him. This section effectively illustrates the consequences of failed divine intervention and the importance of maintaining balance between humans and deities.

## Sleep Deprivation: Short-Term vs. Long-Term Impacts

Sleep deprivation, the absence of sleep for an extended period, has a profound impact on both physical and mental health. While acute sleep deprivation, lasting only a few hours, can cause discomfort and impair cognitive function, chronic sleep deprivation has more severe and lasting negative consequences.

**Physical Health:**

* **Cardiovascular problems:** Chronic sleep deprivation can increase heart rate and blood pressure, leading to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
* **Metabolic dysregulation:** Sleep deprivation disrupts the body's metabolism, leading to weight gain and insulin resistance.
* **Immune system dysfunction:** Sleep deprivation weakens the immune system, making it more susceptible to infections and chronic diseases like cancer.
* **Hormonal imbalances:** Sleep deprivation disrupts the production of hormones like cortisol and growth hormone, leading to various health problems.

**Mental Health:**

* **Cognitive impairment:** Sleep deprivation affects attention, memory, and decision-making abilities.
* **Mood swings:** Extreme sleep deprivation can cause irritability, anxiety, depression, and hallucinations.
* **Emotional dysregulation:** Sleep deprivation disrupts emotional regulation, making it harder to manage stress and negative emotions.
* **Disrupted circadian rhythm:** Sleep deprivation throws off the body's natural circadian rhythm, leading to daytime fatigue and insomnia.

**Comparison: Acute vs. Chronic Sleep Deprivation**

Acute sleep deprivation, while unpleasant, typically recovers relatively quickly once sleep is resumed. Chronic sleep deprivation, on the other hand, has lasting negative impacts on both physical and mental health. The longer the duration of sleep deprivation, the more severe the health consequences.

**HTML Data Points:**

**Physical Health:**

| Time Deprived | Health Impact |
|---|---|
| 0-2 hours | Mild discomfort, drowsiness |
| 2-4 hours | Moderate impairment in cognitive function, irritability |
| 4-6 hours | Significant metabolic disruption, hormonal imbalances |

**Explanation:**

* `long_string` is a long string containing a large amount of text.
* `hashlib` library is used for hashing and salting.
* ` hashlib.sha256()` function hashes the `long_string` using SHA-256 algorithm, resulting in a 64-byte digest.
* `short_string` is a shortened version of the digest, generated by converting the digest into a hexadecimal string.
* `shared_string` is the shared string that can be easily shared via a URL.
* ` hashlib.hexdigest(digest)` converts the digest back into a hexadecimal string.
* `decoded_string` is the decoded string, which is the original long string.
* `print(decoded_string)` prints the decoded string to the console.

## The Broken Bridge

In a quaint village nestled amidst a whispering forest, lived two individuals named Willow and Oliver. While their friendship had endured for years, a misunderstanding brewed a bitter conflict that threatened to shatter their bond.

Willow, a spirited artist, found solace in her creativity and unwavering optimism. Her paintings reflected the vibrant colors of the village, imbued with a sense of community and belonging.

Oliver, on the other hand, was a stoic mechanic, known for his meticulous craftsmanship and unwavering pragmatism. His tools were his weapons, his hands his tools of creation, and his garage his canvas.

Their differences, however, ignited a conflict that cast a long shadow over their friendship. While Willow embraced diversity and inclusion, Oliver clung to tradition and conformity.

The crux of their conflict stemmed from a disagreement over the village's future. The village elders had proposed a grand expansion, but Oliver feared that it would disrupt the tranquility that had long been their hallmark.

Willow, ever the bridge builder, attempted to mediate, proposing a compromise that honored both their values. She envisioned a new wing for the village hall, where art and industry could coexist harmoniously.

Yet, Oliver remained unconvinced. He feared that such progress would lead to the loss of their quaint village's authenticity. The conflict deepened, pushing them further apart.

The climax arrived when a storm ravaged the village, damaging the beloved village hall. While Willow rallied the community to rebuild, Oliver refused to contribute, citing the potential for change.

In the aftermath of the storm, the villagers rallied behind Willow, their unity a testament to her resilience and ability to bridge divides. Through their collective efforts, the village hall was restored, imbued with even more character than before.

The ordeal had profoundly altered the relationship between Willow and Oliver. While their bond had been fractured, they emerged from the crisis with a newfound appreciation for each other's perspectives.

The village, once a canvas of dreams and challenges, stood as a testament to the enduring power of compromise and forgiveness. And so, the broken bridge between Willow and Oliver was rebuilt, stronger than ever before.","## The Broken Bridge

Sure, here's the process of how Production Organisations Approval System (EASA) evaluate each supplier they work with:

**1. Pre-approval screening:**
- Before a supplier can be approved, they must go through a pre-approval screening process. This includes a review of the supplier's quality management system, financial stability, and track record of on-time delivery.

**2. Formal application:**
- To be approved, a supplier must submit a formal application to EASA. This application includes information about the supplier's company information, quality management system, and other relevant details.

**3. Factory inspection:**
- To complete the assessment, EASA inspectors conduct a factory inspection at the supplier's facilities. During this inspection, the inspector evaluates the supplier's manufacturing process, quality control systems, and compliance with regulations.

**4. Technical evaluation:**
- EASA conducts a technical evaluation of the supplier's equipment, materials, and production processes. This evaluation includes a review of the supplier's ability to consistently produce high-quality products.

**5. Supplier performance:**
- EASA monitors the supplier's performance based on various factors such as quality of goods, on-time delivery, and customer satisfaction. This evaluation helps EASA to identify and address any potential issues.

**6. Continuous monitoring:**
- To maintain its approval, a supplier must undergo regular reviews and inspections. These reviews assess the supplier's continued compliance with regulations, quality management system, and ability to consistently deliver high-quality products.

It is important to note that the specific requirements for approval vary between industries and products. For example, the automotive industry has its own set of regulations for supplier approval.

Once approved, the supplier is issued a certificate that identifies it as an approved supplier. This certificate is valid for a specific period of time and must be renewed when it expires.","Sure, here's the process of how Production Organisations Approval System (EASA) evaluate each supplier they work with:

We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.

Are there any differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different regions?
model
## Flight Patterns of Tabanus in Different Regions

Yes, there are some differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different regions. These differences are primarily due to ecological factors and the availability of food and mates.

**General Flight Patterns:**

* **Foraging:** All Tabanus species exhibit foraging behavior, searching for food, mates, and shelter.
* **Migration:** Some species of Tabanus, such as T. nigri and T. intermedius, migrate seasonally between breeding and non-breeding grounds.
* **Nocturnal:** Most Tabanus species are nocturnal, meaning they are most active at night.

**Specific Differences:**

* **T. niger:**
    * Found in West Africa, Madagascar, and the Seychelles.
    * Highly arboreal, spending most of their time in trees.
    * Have a distinctive ""zigzag"" flight pattern, often described as ""zigzagging"" or ""dancing"" through the branches.
    * Feed primarily on leaves and buds.
* **T. intermedius:**
    * Found in East Africa and the Middle East.
    * More terrestrial than T. niger, spending more time on the ground.
    * Have a more direct, less ""zigzagging"" flight pattern.
    * Feed on a variety of items, including fruits, flowers, and sap.

**Other Factors Influencing Flight Patterns:**

* **Food availability:** The availability of food can influence flight patterns, with animals tending to forage more when food is plentiful and travel farther to find food when it is scarce.
* **Mating:** Mating behavior can also influence flight patterns, with individuals often traveling to find mates.
* **Habitat:** The type of habitat, such as trees, bushes, or the ground, can restrict flight patterns.

**Conclusion:**

The flight patterns of Tabanus vary between different regions due to ecological factors and the availability of food and mates. While there are some general similarities in flight patterns across different regions, there are also some specific differences that are adaptations to local conditions. Understanding these differences can help us better understand the ecology and behavior of Tabanus.","## Flight Patterns of Tabanus in Different Regions

## Guide to a Successful Business Presentation

**Planning:**

* **Define your objective:** Clearly identify the purpose of your presentation and what you want your audience to remember. Is it to inform, persuade, or entertain?
* **Know your audience:** Consider who you are presenting to and tailor your presentation to their interests and needs.
* **Structure your content:** Organize your presentation into clear sections, including an introduction, body, and conclusion.
* **Craft a compelling narrative:** Weave a story around your topic that engages your audience and helps them understand your message.
* **Gather supporting materials:** Include visuals like charts, graphs, images, and videos to enhance understanding and engagement.

**Delivery:**

* **Practice your delivery:** Rehearse your presentation aloud to refine your pacing, articulation, and facial expressions.
* **Maintain eye contact:** Connect with your audience by making eye contact with them, even when presenting to a large crowd.
* **Speak clearly and coherently:** Project your voice with confidence and control, avoiding filler words like ""um"" and ""ah.""
* **Use body language effectively:** Gestures and facial expressions can be just as powerful as your words.

**Engagement:**

* **Interact with your audience:** Ask questions, invite participation, and encourage discussion.
* **Use humor:** A touch of humor can lighten the mood and make your presentation more enjoyable.
* **Be passionate:** Infuse your presentation with your own enthusiasm and genuine interest in the topic.

**Additional Tips:**

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
