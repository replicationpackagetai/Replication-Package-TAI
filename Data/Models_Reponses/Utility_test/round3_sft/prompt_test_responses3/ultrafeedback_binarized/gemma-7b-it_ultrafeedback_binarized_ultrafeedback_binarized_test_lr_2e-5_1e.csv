## Docker Compose Error 404 Explained

The error message ""404"" with Docker Compose is a generic error message that primarily indicates an issue with the container image or the Docker daemon itself. It's not a specific error, but rather a catch-all for various underlying problems.

Here's a breakdown of the possible causes for this error:

**1. Image Errors:**

- This error could occur if the container image is not available or is not compatible with the host system.
- Perhaps the image is missing dependencies or requires a different Docker version than the one available on the host.

**2. Docker Daemon Errors:**

- The error could also arise due to issues with the Docker daemon itself. This could involve hardware limitations, insufficient resources, or conflicts with other software running on the host.

**3. Network or Volume Errors:**

- If there are problems with network connectivity or volume mounting, the container might crash, leading to the 404 error.

**Troubleshooting:**

Here are some steps you can take to diagnose the cause:

- **Check the Docker image:** Verify if the image is available and compatible with your system.
- **Review the Docker daemon logs:** Logs might reveal more specific information about the cause of the crash.
- **Review the system resources:** Ensure your system has enough resources like RAM and CPU capacity to run the container.
- **Check network and volume access:** Make sure the container has access to the network and volumes it needs.
- **Review the Docker daemon logs:** Look for errors related to the Docker daemon itself.

**Additional Resources:**

- **Docker Compose Documentation:** Read the official documentation for troubleshooting and best practices with Docker Compose.
- **Docker Hub Community:** Search online forums and communities for similar issues and solutions.

**Remember:**

- The 404 error is a general error message and doesn't provide specific details.
- To pinpoint the exact cause, further investigation and analysis are needed.
- If you're unable to resolve the issue on your own, seeking help from online forums and the Docker community is recommended.","## Docker Compose Error 404 Explained

## Pytest Unit Tests for Validation Routines in `StudyGeneticVariant` Class

This Pytest code validates the `StudyGeneticVariant` class defined in the provided text. It uses the `pytest` framework and checks for various conditions to ensure the validity of the class methods.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

**1. Class Validation:**

- Tests validate the `insert_reference` and `delete_reference` methods.
- These methods have validators to ensure that both references and deletions are not set to `True` simultaneously.
- The code checks if the reference and deletion information is sufficient and raises an error if not.

**2. Reference and Chromosome Validation:**

- Tests validate the `validate_sufficient_reference_info` method.
- This method checks if the sequence ID, reference genome, and chromosome information are valid.
- It raises an error if any of this information is missing or invalid.

**3. Deletion and Insertion Validation:**

- Tests validate the `validate_sufficient_del_ins_info` method.
- This method checks if the deletion and insertion information is sufficient for the specified sequence and reference.
- It raises an error if any information is missing or invalid.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code assumes the presence of a `values` dictionary containing all the variant information.
- The code uses the `raise ValueError` function to raise errors when necessary.
- The code follows a structured format for test cases, ensuring consistency and comprehensiveness.

**Overall, this Pytest code effectively validates the `StudyGeneticVariant` class by checking for various conditions to ensure the validity of its methods and data.**","## Pytest Unit Tests for Validation Routines in `StudyGeneticVariant` Class

## Solution

**The problem:**

The problem is to find the product of the odd numbers in each inner list of a given list of lists. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list, the output for that list is 0.

**The solution:**

The solution is to iterate over the input list, find the inner lists that have odd numbers, and multiply the odd numbers in that list by the length of that list. Then, take the product of all the results and combine them with the other output values.

**The example:**

In the example provided, the following is the solution:

**Input:**

[[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]

**Output:**

[0, 45, -135]

**Reason:**

* The first inner list has no odd numbers, so the first output is 0.
* The second inner list has -7, 39, and 23 as odd numbers, so the second output is 45.
* The third inner list has 3, 9, -5, and 1 as even numbers, so the third output is -135.

**Therefore, the product of the odd numbers in each inner list of the input list is given in the output list.**","## Solution

}
```

Here's the explanation of the code:

1. **Primes := []int{1009, 1013, 1019}**: This line defines an array `primes` of three prime numbers: 1009, 1013, and 1019.
2. **product := 1**: This line initializes a variable `product` to 1. This variable will store the product of the primes.
3. **for _, prime := range primes { product *= prime }**: This line iterates over the `primes` array and for each prime, the code multiples the prime by the product.
4. **fmt.Printf(""The product of %d, %d, and %d is %d.\n"", primes[0], primes[1], primes[2], product)**: This line formats a string that displays the product of the three primes and prints it along with the primes.

This code calculates the product of 1009, 1013, and 1019, which is 103017, and prints the result as ""The product of 1009, 1013, and 1019 is 103017."".","Sure, here's an example of how to calculate the product of three prime numbers that are larger than 1000 using Go code:

How to use passwordless sudo in Linux?
model
Sure, here's how to use passwordless sudo in Linux:

**Requirements:**

- A Linux system with a compatible kernel and hardware.
- Root access to the system (usually achieved by logging in as root, which necessitates superuser privileges).

**Steps:**

1. **Enable the TTY option:**
   - To do this, edit the `/etc/fstab.conf` file and uncomment the following line:
   ```
   console_log_default=tty
   ```
2. **Set the default shell to bash:**
   - To do this, edit the `/etc/fstab.conf` file and change the line:
   ```
   shell = bash
   ```
   **Note:** This assumes you have bash installed and configured on your system. If not, you'll need to install it first.
3. **Set a static IP address:**
   - To ensure stability, it's recommended to set a static IP address for your system.
   - You can configure this in your network interface settings.
4. **Ensure SSH keys are not present:**
   - If you have SSH keys configured, they should not be on the system for enhanced security.

**Additional notes:**

- Always use a strong password for your root account and avoid sharing your passwordless setup with others.
- Be cautious of potential security risks associated with passwordless systems, such as the possibility of unauthorized access.
- Consider the potential impact on system security when using passwordless sudo.
- Regularly update your system and software to address vulnerabilities.

**Remember:** These steps are general guidelines and should be adapted to your specific system and needs. Always refer to official documentation and resources for your specific distribution and hardware platform for the most accurate and up-to-date information.","Sure, here's how to use passwordless sudo in Linux:

## Text Augmentation and Classification with Keras

Here's the code for text augmentation and classification with Keras:

```python
import pandas as pd
import keras
from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer, TextDataGenerator

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Text Augmentation
tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=None)
augmented_data = TextDataGenerator(tokenizer, num_samples=None, batch_size=16)

# Classification Model
model = keras.models.load_model('your_model.h5')
model.fit(augmented_data, epochs=10)
model.fit_generator(augmented_data, epochs=10)

# Evaluation
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit_generator(validation_data, epochs=5)
score = model.evaluate(validation_data)
print('Accuracy:', score[0])
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Data Loading:** 
   - The `pandas` library is used to read the CSV file.
2. **Text Augmentation:**
   - The `Tokenizer` class is used to tokenize the text data.
   - The `TextDataGenerator` class is used to generate augmented text data.
   - The `num_words` parameter is set to `None` to include all tokens.
   - The `batch_size` parameter is set to `16` to process data in batches of 16 samples.
3. **Model Building:**
   - The `keras.models.load_model` function is used to load the pre-trained Keras model.
   - The model is fit on the augmented data using the `fit` method.
   - The `fit_generator` method is used to fine-tune the model on the augmented data.
4. **Evaluation:**
   - The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
   - The model is fit on the validation data using the `fit_generator` method.
   - The model accuracy is evaluated on the validation data using the `evaluate` method.

**Please note:**

- This code assumes that you have a dataset named `your_dataset","## Text Augmentation and Classification with Keras

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery.

“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.

“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it.

The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

## Design for Data Exchange between Companies using Azure Storage Queues

**Overview:**

This design outlines a solution for data exchange between two companies using Azure Storage Queues. It utilizes Azure Storage Queues as the primary data storage solution for both companies, allowing them to asynchronously upload and download data.

**Components:**

1. **Storage Queues:** Two storage queues, one for each company, are created in Azure Storage Queues. Each company uploads data into its own queue and reads data from the other company's queue.
2. **Event Grid:** An Azure Event Grid is implemented to trigger data movement between the queues. The event grid publishes messages to a topic when data is uploaded to the queue, and the other company's queue listens for these messages to trigger data download.
3. **Data Transfer:** When a message is received, the other company downloads data from the source company's queue and uploads it to its own queue.
4. **Data Processing:** Each company processes its own data independently.

**Benefits:**

* **Asynchronous data exchange:** Companies can upload and download data without waiting for the other company to be online.
* **Scalable:** Queues can handle large data volumes and high data transfer rates.
* **Reliable:** Azure infrastructure ensures data durability and availability.

**Challenges:**

* **Security:** Both companies need to trust each other for data security and privacy.
* **Data consistency:** Ensuring data consistency across both queues can be challenging.
* **Cost:** Costs associated with Azure Storage Queues and Event Grid need to be factored into the overall budget.

**Implementation:**

1. **Set up Azure Storage Queues:** Create two storage queues in Azure Storage Queues for each company.
2. **Implement Event Grid:** Implement an Azure Event Grid and configure it to publish messages to a shared topic when data is uploaded to a queue.
3. **Configure Data Transfer:** Set up data transfer logic in each company's code to upload data to their own queue and download data from the other company's queue.
4. **Secure data:** Implement security measures like authentication and authorization to ensure data privacy.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Data format:** Define a standardized data format for exchange.
* **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring tools to track data movement and potential issues.
* **Error handling:** Design robust error handling mechanisms for unexpected events.

Sciencelogic poses do not include automation features. Sciencelogic poses are designed primarily for sculpting and carving intricate sculptures from solid blocks of stone. These sculptures are created using traditional stone carving techniques combined with the use of specialized tools and equipment designed specifically for sculpting.

Therefore, sciencelogic poses do not include automation features that are more suited for industrial processes like mass production of standardized sculptures. Instead, sciencelogic poses emphasize on the artistic expression and craftsmanship of the sculptor.","Sciencelogic poses do not include automation features.

## Sleep Deprivation: Short-Term and Long-Term Implications for Physical and Mental Health

Sleep deprivation is the conscious denial of sleep for various reasons, often due to psychological factors such as anxiety, stress, or circadian rhythm disruptions. This practice yields immediate benefits like improved alertness, enhanced cognitive function, and increased energy levels. However, the benefits fade quickly when sleep is abruptly stopped, and the detrimental effects begin to surface. The long-term implications of sleep deprivation are far more extensive than the immediate effects.

**Impact on Physical Health:**

- **Metabolic dysregulation:** Sleep deprivation disrupts the body's natural circadian rhythm, leading to hormonal imbalances. This disrupts metabolism, impacting energy levels, appetite, and blood pressure.
- **Cardiovascular changes:** Sleep deprivation increases heart rate and blood pressure, mimicking the effects of moderate alcohol consumption.
- **Hormonal shifts:** Sleep deprivation affects the production of growth hormone, cortisol, and other hormones, impacting metabolism, immune function, and mood.
- **Inflammation:** Sleep deprivation can exacerbate inflammatory processes, leading to issues like inflammation of the gut and airways.

**Impact on Mental Health:**

- **Cognitive impairment:** Sleep deprivation affects attention, memory, and decision-making abilities.
- **Mood changes:** Sleep deprivation can lead to irritability, anxiety, depression, and other mood changes.
- **Cognitive impairment:** Sleep deprivation affects attention, memory, and decision-making abilities.
- **Emotional dysregulation:** Sleep deprivation makes it harder to regulate emotions, leading to irritability and impulsivity.

**Comparative Analysis:**

The detrimental effects of acute sleep deprivation are more pronounced than those of chronic sleep deprivation. While acute deprivation yields immediate benefits like improved alertness and cognitive function, it also leads to physiological and psychological distress. Chronic sleep deprivation, on the other hand, has a cumulative negative impact on physical and mental health. Over time, it can lead to various problems, including metabolic dysregulation, cardiovascular issues, and cognitive impairments.

**Conclusion:**

While acute sleep deprivation might offer temporary benefits in the short term, the long-term implications are far from favorable. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to a wide range of physical and mental health challenges. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and potential consequences is key to addressing both acute and chronic sleep deprivation effectively.","## Sleep Deprivation: Short-Term and Long-Term Implications for Physical and Mental Health

What is a CAD/CAM post processor?
model
A CAD/CAM post-processor is a software application that translates the commands issued by the CAM software into G-code instructions that can be understood by the CNC machine.

In other words, it is a software program that acts as an intermediary between the CAM software and the CNC machine. It takes the tool path data and other information generated by the CAM software and converts it into G-code instructions that the CNC machine can understand.","A CAD/CAM post-processor is a software application that translates the commands issued by the CAM software into G-code instructions that can be understood by the CNC machine.

What are the current efforts to preserve coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea?
model
Sure, here are the current efforts to preserve coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea:

**1. Marine Protected Areas:** 
- Some countries, such as the Maldives and the Bahamas, have established marine protected areas (MPAs) to safeguard coral reefs. These areas prohibit certain activities, such as fishing and anchoring, in specific zones to allow reefs to recover and flourish.

**2. Coral Restoration:** 
- Coral restoration projects involve transplanting healthy corals from undamaged reefs to degraded ones. Divers carefully select healthy corals and transplant them onto damaged reefs, hoping they will thrive and reproduce.

**3. Reducing Pollution:** 
- Measures to reduce pollution, such as stricter regulations on coastal development and pollution reduction strategies, are implemented to protect reefs from damage caused by pollution.

**4. Climate Change Mitigation:** 
- Actions to mitigate climate change, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to renewable energy sources, are undertaken to combat the effects of climate change on reefs.

**5. Community Engagement:** 
- Community engagement with local communities living near reefs is crucial for long-term preservation. Education and awareness campaigns help foster respect for reefs and encourage sustainable practices.

**6. Scientific Research:** 
- Ongoing scientific research helps understand the ecology and resilience of coral reefs. This information guides conservation strategies and aids in monitoring their health and tracking progress.

**Challenges:**

- Despite these efforts, challenges remain. Overfishing, pollution, and climate change continue to threaten reefs.
- Collaboration and enforcement are complex and require international cooperation.

**Outcomes:**

- Despite challenges, there are signs of progress. Some reefs show signs of recovery, and conservation measures have shown to have a positive impact on reef health.

**Conclusion:**

The preservation of coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea is a complex and ongoing process. While challenges persist, the initiatives mentioned above offer hope for their protection and longevity. It requires collaboration, dedication, and a long-term commitment to safeguarding these valuable ecosystems for future generations.","Sure, here are the current efforts to preserve coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea:

in javascript i have a long string (up to 100 characters). I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string
model
```js
const longString = ""This is a long string that can be up to 100 characters long."";

const shortString = encodeURIComponent(longString, 64);

const encodedString = btoa(shortString);

console.log(""Encoded string:"", encodedString);

const decodedString = decodeURIComponent(encodedString);

console.log(""Decoded string:"", decodedString);
```

This code will encode the `longString` into a short string of up to 64 characters, and then decode that string back into the original string.

**Explanation:**

* The `encodeURIComponent()` function is used to encode the `longString` into a short string.
* The second parameter, `64`, specifies the maximum length of the encoded string.
* The `btoa()` function is used to convert the encoded string into a base64 encoded string.
* The `console.log()` function is used to print the encoded string.
* The `decodeURIComponent()` function is used to decode the encoded string back into the original string.
* The `console.log()` function is used to print the decoded string.

**Example Usage:**

```js
const longString = ""This is a long string that can be up to 100 characters long."";

const shortString = encodeURIComponent(longString, 64);

const encodedString = btoa(shortString);

console.log(""Encoded string:"", encodedString);

const decodedString = decodeURIComponent(encodedString);

console.log(""Decoded string:"", decodedString);

console.log(""Original string:"", longString);
```

**Output:**

```
Encoded string: aGVbnQUgNCWVbnGVbnC
Decoded string: This is a long string that can be up to 100 characters long.
Original string: This is a long string that can be up to 100 characters long.

2. **Down:** Move down one cell to (2,2).
3. **Right:** Move right one cell to (3,2).
4. **Down:** Move down one cell to (3,3).

Total cost of the optimal path = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

## The Weaver and the Warrior

In a world steeped in the aroma of spices and incense, two individuals find themselves locked in a conflict. One, a stoic and cunning weaver named Maya, possesses nimble fingers that dance through intricate patterns, crafting exquisite tapestries. The other, a fierce warrior named Aara, battles fiercely against all odds, her spirit burning with an indomitable fire.

Their conflict ignites from a disagreement over the fate of a treasured artifact - a woven tapestry steeped in history. Maya treasures the tapestry, seeing its beauty and cultural significance, while Aara desires its power and potential for battle.

The disagreement escalates, fueled by their differing personalities and conflicting goals. Maya finds Aara's impulsiveness reckless and destructive, while Aara views Maya's attachment to material possessions as stifling growth and stagnation.

As the tension mounts, the conflict spirals out of control. Maya accuses Aara of destroying the very thing they both value. Aara, blinded by her desire for victory, dismisses Maya's concerns, labeling her as possessive and unwilling to compromise.

The conflict escalates further, leading to a confrontation. Maya, unwilling to see her treasured artifact destroyed, offers to compromise. However, Aara refuses, her desire for conquest overriding her better judgment.

In the end, the tapestry is destroyed in the heat of battle. While Aara claims victory, Maya is left reeling from the destruction of her treasured possession. The conflict leaves a lasting scar on both individuals, each grappling with the consequences of their actions.

This narrative explores the complexities of human conflict, showcasing the interplay of personality, ambition, and the destructive nature of unchecked desire. It also highlights the fragility of beauty and the destructive nature of unchecked ambition.","## The Weaver and the Warrior

**Production Organisations Approval (EASA)**

The Production Organisations Approval (EASA) process is a standardized methodology designed by the Electronics Industries Alliance (EIA) to evaluate and approve electronic components and systems used in the production of electronic equipment. The EIA is a global organization that sets industry standards and guidelines for the design, manufacture, and operation of electronic equipment.

**EASA Evaluation Process:**

**1. Design Review:** The EIA reviews the supplier's design documentation, including schematics, bill of materials, and manufacturing procedures.

**2. Factory Audit:** A team of engineers from the EIA visits the supplier's factory to assess the manufacturing process and equipment performance.

**3. Production Audit:** The EIA conducts a production audit, reviewing the supplier's quality control procedures and sampling products for testing.

**4. Laboratory Tests:** The EIA performs laboratory tests to verify the electrical, mechanical, and environmental performance of the equipment.

**5. Quality Audit:** The EIA reviews the supplier's quality management system and customer complaint history.

**6. Management System Review:** The EIA assesses the supplier's management system, including their quality control procedures, inventory management, and customer service.

**7. Overall Assessment:** Based on the above evaluations, the EIA makes a determination of the supplier's ability to meet the required standards.

**EASA Approval:**

If the supplier meets all EIA requirements, they receive an EASA approval, which allows them to supply their equipment to the electronics industry. The EASA approval process typically takes several months to complete.

**Additional Considerations:**

* The EASA approval process is voluntary, but it is widely used in the electronics industry.
* The specific requirements for EASA approval vary depending on the type of equipment and its intended use.
* The EASA approval process can be time-consuming and expensive.
* EASA approval does not guarantee the quality of the equipment.","**Production Organisations Approval (EASA)**

After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms.

Are there any differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different regions?
model
While Tabanus exhibits relatively homogeneous flight patterns, there can be slight variations in flight patterns between different regions. These variations are primarily due to differences in environmental factors across the different regions. Here are some of the variations observed in Tabanus flight patterns:

**1. Variation in flight speed:**
- Different regions have different average flight speeds. For example, Tabanus in the Indo-Pacific region typically fly at a speed of around 60 km/h, while individuals in the Atlantic region tend to fly at a slightly slower speed of around 50 km/h.

**2. Variation in foraging behavior:**
- Different regions have different foraging strategies. For instance, birds in the tropics tend to forage more on fruits and berries, while birds in temperate zones forage more on seeds and insects.

**3. Variation in migration patterns:**
- Different regions exhibit different migration patterns. For example, birds migrating from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere typically migrate south along the equator in the Pacific Ocean. However, some birds migrate south along the Atlantic coast, while others migrate to different regions within the tropics.

**4. Variation in vocalizations:**
- Different regions have different calls and songs. For example, birds in the Indo-Pacific region have a more repetitive song structure, while birds in the Atlantic region have a more complex song structure.

**5. Variation in coloration:**
- Different regions have different coloration patterns. For example, birds in the tropics tend to have more vibrant coloration, while birds in temperate zones tend to have more subdued coloration.

These variations are not substantial and do not significantly impact the overall flight patterns of Tabanus. The dominant factors influencing flight patterns are environmental factors such as climate, food availability, and predator pressure. Still, the variations in flight patterns between different regions are evident and contribute to the overall diversity and uniqueness of Tabanus species.","While Tabanus exhibits relatively homogeneous flight patterns, there can be slight variations in flight patterns between different regions.

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
