Here are some general guidelines:

1. Size of the space: The size of the room is a crucial factor in determining the number of plants needed. A larger room will require more plants to effectively purify the air. As a general rule, one plant can clean the air in a room of up to 100 square feet. So, if your closet office is 100 square feet or less, you may only need one plant. If it's larger, you may need more.

2. Number of people in the room: The number of people in the room is also a factor. The more people in the room, the more plants you will need to purify the air. As a general rule, one plant can clean the air for up to four people. So, if you have four or fewer people in the room, you may only need one plant. If you have more people, you may need more.

3. Type of plants: The type of plants you choose can also affect the number of plants needed. Some plants are more effective at purifying the air than others. For example, spider plants, peace lilies, and snake plants are known for their air-purifying abilities. If you choose these types of plants, you may need fewer plants to purify the air. However, if you choose plants that are not as effective at purifying the air, you may need more plants.

In summary, the number of plants needed to purify the air in your closet office will depend on the size of the room, the number of people in the room, and the type of plants you choose. As a general rule, one plant can clean the air in a room of up to 100 square feet for up to four people. However, you may need more or fewer plants depending on the specific circumstances."

Here's a simple JavaScript program that allows users to draw on an HTML5 canvas. This example uses the `mousedown`, `mousemove`, and `mouseup` events to handle the drawing process.

        let isDrawing = false;
        let lastX = 0;
        let lastY = 0;

        canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
            isDrawing = true;
            [lastX, lastY] = [e.offsetX, e.offsetY];

            isDrawing = false;
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This code creates a canvas element and sets up event listeners for mouse events. When the user clicks and drags the mouse, the `mousemove` event is triggered, and the program draws a line from the last known position to the current position. The `mousedown` event starts the drawing process, and the `mouseup` and `mouseout` events stop it.

To use this code, simply copy and paste it into an HTML file and open it in a web browser. You can then use your mouse to draw on the canvas."

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]
Student:","Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. First, we need to identify the odd numbers in each inner list.
2. Then, we multiply the odd numbers in each inner list.
3. If there are no odd numbers, we output 0 for that list.

Let's start with the first inner list: [40, -36, 45, -47]
- Odd numbers: 45, -47
- Multiplication: 45 * -47 = -2115

Now, let's move to the second inner list: [-7, 39, 4, 23]
- Odd numbers: -7, 39, 23
- Multiplication: -7 * 39 * 23 = -6279

For the third inner list: [-26, -3, 32, 1]
- Odd numbers: -3, 1
- Multiplication: -3 * 1 = -3

For the fourth inner list: [-3, 20, -14, -38]
- Odd numbers: -3
- Multiplication: -3

For the fifth inner list: [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49]
- Odd numbers: -49
- Multiplication: -49

For the sixth inner list: [-19, 28, -39]
- Odd numbers: -19, -39
- Multiplication: -19 * -39 = 741

For the seventh inner list: [43, 8]
- Odd numbers: 43

20. What's is the sum of the squares of all factors of 210?","To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the squares of all factors of 210. Let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the factors of 210. The factors of 210 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, and 210.

2. Next, we need to find the squares of each factor. The squares of the factors are 1, 4, 9, 25, 36, 49, 100, 196, 225, 441, 900, 1225, 1764, 4900, 11025, and 44100.

3. Now, we need to find the sum of these squares. We can do this by adding them up:

1 + 4 + 9 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 100 + 196 + 225 + 441 + 900 + 1225 + 1764 + 4900 + 11025 + 44100 = 72075

| Perfect Information | A perfectly informed patient knows exactly what treatment they need and can make an informed decision about their care. | Healthcare providers often have more information about the patient's condition and treatment options than the patient, leading to information asymmetry. |
| Perfect Competition | A perfectly competitive market has many buyers and sellers, and no single buyer or seller has a significant market share. | Healthcare providers often have significant market power, and patients may have limited choices due to the high cost of care. |
| Perfectly Elastic Demand | A perfectly elastic demand curve means that any change in price will result in a change in quantity demanded. | Healthcare providers often have inelastic demand, meaning that patients will continue to seek care even if the price increases. |
| Perfectly Inelastic Supply | A perfectly inelastic supply curve means that the quantity supplied does not change in response to changes in price. | Healthcare providers often have inelastic supply, meaning that they cannot increase the quantity of care they provide in response to increased demand. |
| Perfectly Competitive Pricing | A perfectly competitive market has prices that are determined by the interaction of supply and demand. | Healthcare providers often have prices that are not determined by the interaction of supply and demand, leading to price gouging and other forms of market failure. |

However, it's important to note that `ParentName` is not a built-in property in Lua or Roblox. It's a custom property that you can define for a script or a variable.

To use `v.ParentName`, you need to create a custom property for the variable `v` and assign a value to it. Here's an example:

```lua
local v = Instance.new(""Part"")
v.ParentName = ""MyPart""

print(v.ParentName) -- Output: MyPart
```

In this example, we create a new `Part` instance and assign the value ""MyPart"" to the `ParentName` property. Then, we print the value of `ParentName` to the console.

Keep in mind that `ParentName` is not a built-in property, so you need to define it yourself."

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy shrank by 20.4% in the second quarter of 2020, making it the worst affected of major industrial nations, while Scotland's economy contracted by 19.4%."

The = symbol is a special character in regular expressions, and it is used to match the literal = character, so you need to escape it with a backslash (\) to match it as a literal character. For example, to match the literal = character, you would use the regular expression pattern \=.
Here is an example of how to use the \= regular expression pattern in Python:
```python
import re

# Define the regular expression pattern
pattern = r'\='

# Define the string to search
string = 'This is a test string with a literal = symbol.'

# Use the re.search() function to search for the pattern in the string
match = re.search(pattern, string)

# Print the match object
print(match)
```

This will output:
```python
<_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(22, 23), match='='>
```

This means that the regular expression pattern \= was found in the string at position 22, and the match object contains the matched string.
You can also use the re.findall() function to find all occurrences of the pattern in the string:
```python
import re

# Define the regular expression pattern
pattern = r'\='

# Define the string to search
string = 'This is a test string with a literal = symbol. And another = symbol here.'

# Use the re.findall() function to find all occurrences of the pattern in the string
matches = re.findall(pattern, string)

# Print the matches
print(matches)
```

This will output:
```python
['=', '=']
```

This means that the regular expression pattern \= was found in the string at positions 22 and 41, and the matches object contains the matched strings.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Sure, here's a paraphrased version of Kimmel's statement about Trump playing golf more than any other president, and how it connects to his critique of Trump's accomplishments:

""Donald Trump has set a new record for playing golf more than any other president in the first year of his presidency. However, Kimmel argues that this record is not a measure of Trump's accomplishments. Instead, he suggests that people who say Trump hasn't done anything should take action and sign up for the Affordable Care Act's open enrollment period, which is currently happening. Kimmel criticizes Trump and half of Congress for their efforts to undermine the plan, but he also points out that enrollment has surged despite these efforts. He encourages viewers to keep an open mind and sign up for the plan if they don't have health insurance."""

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

1. **Azure Storage Queues**: Both companies will use Azure Storage Queues to facilitate the exchange of data. Azure Storage Queues are a reliable, scalable, and durable message storage service that can be used to implement a message-based architecture.

2. **Sender Company**: The sender company will create a queue in Azure Storage and use the Azure Storage SDK or REST API to send messages to the queue. Each message will contain the data that needs to be exchanged.

3. **Receiver Company**: The receiver company will also create a queue in Azure Storage and use the Azure Storage SDK or REST API to receive messages from the queue. When a message is received, the receiver company can process the data and take appropriate action.

4. **Message Structure**: The messages sent to the queue should be structured in a way that is easy to process and understand. For example, the message could contain a JSON object with the data to be exchanged.

5. **Error Handling**: To ensure that the data exchange is reliable, the sender company should implement error handling to handle any issues that may arise during the data exchange process. For example, if a message is not received by the receiver company, the sender company should be able to resend the message.

6. **Security**: To ensure that the data exchange is secure, both companies should implement appropriate security measures, such as using Azure Active Directory for authentication and authorization, and encrypting the data in transit and at rest.

7. **Monitoring and Logging**: To ensure that the data exchange is working as expected, both companies should implement monitoring and logging to track the status of the data exchange process. For example, the sender company could log the number of messages sent and the number of messages received, and the receiver company could log the number of messages received and the number of messages processed.

8. **Scalability**: To ensure that the data exchange can handle a large volume of data, both companies should implement scalability measures, such as using Azure Storage Queues with multiple partitions and using Azure Functions to process the data in parallel.

9. **Testing**: Before implementing the data exchange process, both companies should test the process to ensure that it works as expected. For example, the sender company could send a test message to the queue and the receiver company could receive and process the message to ensure that the data exchange process is working as expected.

10. **Documentation**:"

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:
****
[A]: sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period


[Q]: Question: ""What do the factories need to keep their charters?""  Context: ""In the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of Machilipatnam on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted King James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.""  Answer:
****
[A]: high profits


[Q]: Question: ""Which disease does not cause more death than lower respiratory infections, TB or pertussis?""  Context: ""The top three single agent/disease killers are HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. While the number of deaths due to nearly every disease have decreased, deaths due to HIV/AIDS have increased fourfold. Childhood diseases include pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles and tetanus. Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory and diarrheal deaths. In 2012, approximately 3.1 million people have died due to lower respiratory infections, making it the number 4 leading cause of death in the world.""  Answer:

To preserve these valuable ecosystems, various efforts are being made to protect and restore coral reefs in the region. Here are some of the current efforts to preserve coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea:

1. Coral Reef Conservation Programs: Many organizations, such as the Caribbean Coral Reef Institute (CCRI), the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre (CCCCC), and the Caribbean Marine Protected Areas Network (Caribbean MPA Network), are working to conserve and restore coral reefs in the region. These programs focus on reducing pollution, protecting marine habitats, and promoting sustainable fishing practices.

2. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs): MPAs are designated areas where human activities are regulated to protect marine ecosystems, including coral reefs. In the Caribbean, many countries have established MPAs to protect coral reefs and other marine habitats. For example, the Bahamas has established the Bahamas National Marine Sanctuary, which covers over 100,000 square miles of marine habitat, including coral reefs.

3. Coral Reef Restoration: Coral reef restoration efforts involve the active restoration of damaged or degraded coral reefs.

3. Feature Extraction: Extract features from the preprocessed text using techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings. These features will be used to train the model.

4. Model Selection: Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for sentiment analysis, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or neural networks. Alternatively, you can use pre-trained models like BERT or RoBERTa, which have been fine-tuned for sentiment analysis.

5. Model Training: Train the selected model on the preprocessed and feature-extracted data. Use cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and avoid overfitting.

6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Use a separate test dataset to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

7. Model Optimization: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance. Use techniques such as grid search or random search to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

8. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a production environment, where it can be used to analyze new text data in real-time.

9. Continuous Monitoring: Continuously monitor the model's performance and update it as needed to maintain its accuracy and relevance.

10. Integration with Other NLP Techniques: Integrate the sentiment analysis model with other NLP techniques, such as entity recognition and semantic analysis, to enhance its ability to detect subtle nuances in language and provide more accurate predictions.

By following these steps, we can develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately differentiate positive and negative emotions expressed in textual content."

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode a long string into a short string for sharing via a URL, you can use a combination of Base64 encoding and URL-safe encoding. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this in JavaScript:

1. Base64 Encoding: Convert the long string to a Base64 encoded string. This will make the string shorter and more URL-friendly.
2. URL-Safe Encoding: Convert the Base64 encoded string to a URL-safe format by replacing certain characters with their URL-safe equivalents. For example, replace '+' with '-', '/' with '_', and '=' with '%3D'.

Here's a JavaScript function that performs these steps:

```javascript
function encodeStringForUrl(longString) {
  // Step 1: Base64 encode the long string
  const base64Encoded = btoa(longString);

  // Step 2: URL-safe encode the Base64 string
  const urlSafeEncoded = base64Encoded.replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_').replace(/=+$/, '%3D');

  return urlSafeEncoded;
}

function decodeStringFromUrl(urlSafeEncoded) {
  // Step 1: URL-safe decode the string
  const urlSafeDecoded = urlSafeEncoded.replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/').replace(/%3D/g, '=');

  // Step 2: Base64 decode the string
  const base64Decoded = atob(urlSafeDecoded);

  return base64Decoded;
}

// Example usage:
const longString = ""This is a long string that needs to be encoded for sharing via a URL."";
const encodedString = encodeStringForUrl(longString);
console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);

const decodedString = decodeStringFromUrl(encodedString);
console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);
```

This code will encode the long string into a short, URL-safe string and then decode it back to the original string."

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node using Heuristic search, we can use the A* algorithm. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to apply the A* algorithm to this problem:

1. Initialize the open list with the starting node (1,1) and the closed list as empty.
2. Calculate the heuristic value for the starting node, which is the Manhattan distance to the goal node (3,3). In this case, the heuristic value is 4.
3. Add the starting node to the open list with a total cost of 0 (g-value) and the heuristic value (h-value) as the f-value.
4. While the open list is not empty, do the following:
   a. Select the node with the lowest f-value from the open list.
   b. If the selected node is the goal node, then the path is found. Reconstruct the path by following the parent pointers from the goal node to the starting node.
   c. If the selected node is not the goal node, remove it from the open list and add it to the closed list.
   d. For each neighbor of the selected node, calculate the tentative g-value (the cost of the path from the starting node to the neighbor through the selected node) and the tentative h-value (the heuristic value of the neighbor).
   e. If the neighbor is already in the open list and the tentative g-value is greater than the current g-value of the neighbor, do nothing.
   f. If the neighbor is not in the open list or the tentative g-value is less than the current g-value of the neighbor, update the g-value and h-value of the neighbor, set the parent of the neighbor to the selected node, and add the neighbor to the open list.
5. If the open list is empty and the goal node is not found, then there is no path from the starting node to the goal node.

Applying the A* algorithm to the given problem, the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)."

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, you can follow these steps:

1. Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake the mixture for two minutes without ice.
3. Add a small amount of ice (about 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or until the ice has melted.
4. Pour soda water into a Collins glass first, and then strain the cocktail over the soda water.
5. Optionally, you can add cream to the shaker and shake it again for a few seconds before straining it into the Collins glass.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and enjoy your perfectly made Ramos Gin Fizz!

Some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink include:

- Use a high-quality egg white, as it will help create a better foam.
- Use a shaker that is large enough to accommodate the amount of shaking required to create the ideal foam.
- Shake the mixture for at least two minutes, but not more than 35 minutes, as this will help create the perfect foam and bloom.
- Use a small amount of ice to chill the mixture without diluting it too much.
- Strain the cocktail over the soda water to ensure that the foam and bloom are properly distributed.
- Experiment with different types of soda water, as this can affect the texture and flavor of the drink.
- Practice makes perfect, so don't be discouraged if your first few attempts don't turn out perfectly."

Who they are and why they are in conflict.,"Character 1: A young, ambitious and determined woman named Sarah, who is a successful lawyer in a big city. She is known for her sharp wit, quick thinking, and ability to win cases. Sarah is a hard worker and has worked her way up the corporate ladder to become a partner in a prestigious law firm. She is driven by her desire to make a difference in the world and to help those who are wronged.

Character 2: A middle-aged, conservative and traditional man named John, who is a successful businessman in a small town. He is known for his strong moral values, sense of community, and dedication to his family. John is a hard worker and has built a successful business empire, but he is also known for his conservative views and his resistance to change.

Conflict: Sarah and John are in conflict because they have different views on the role of the law and the role of business in society. Sarah believes that the law should be used to protect the rights of individuals and to hold corporations accountable for their actions. She is a strong advocate for social justice and believes that the law should be used to create a more equitable society. John, on the other hand, believes that the law should be used to protect the interests of businesses and to promote economic growth. He is a strong advocate for free market capitalism and believes that the law should be used to create a more prosperous society.

The conflict between Sarah and John is further complicated by the fact that they are both successful and respected members of their respective communities. Sarah is a respected lawyer and a role model for young women, while John is a respected businessman and a leader in his community. This makes it difficult for either of them to compromise or to find common ground.

The conflict between Sarah and John is a complex one, and it is not clear how it will be resolved. However, it is clear that both Sarah and John are committed to their respective causes and that they are not willing to back down."

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","Congham Hall Hotel stands out from other hotels in the area in terms of ambiance and dining options due to its unique charm and tradition. The hotel is a Georgian mansion that has retained its original charm and has been tastefully renovated to provide a luxurious and comfortable stay. The hotel's staff is friendly and welcoming, and the atmosphere is relaxed and peaceful. The hotel's dining options are also exceptional, with a focus on locally sourced ingredients and a range of dishes that cater to different tastes and dietary requirements.

In this example, we have defined two DTO classes: `GroupReadDTO` and `GroupWriteDTO`. The `GroupReadDTO` class is used to represent the data that will be returned to the client when fetching a group, while the `GroupWriteDTO` class is used to represent the data that will be received from the client when creating or updating a group.

We have also defined five endpoints: `get_groups`, `create_group`, `get_group`, `update_group`, and `delete_group`. These endpoints correspond to the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations that can be performed on a group.

The `response_model` parameter in the `@router` decorators is used to specify the expected response format for each endpoint. In this case, we are using the `GroupReadDTO` class to represent the response format for the `get_groups`, `get_group`, and `update_group` endpoints, and the `GroupWrite"

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
