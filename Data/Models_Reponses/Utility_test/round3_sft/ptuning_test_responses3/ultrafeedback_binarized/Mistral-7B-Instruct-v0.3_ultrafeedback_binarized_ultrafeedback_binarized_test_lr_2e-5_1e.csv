One way is to incorporate green spaces, such as parks and gardens, into the design of the development. This can help to reduce the urban heat island effect, which occurs when urban areas are hotter than surrounding rural areas due to the concentration of buildings and pavement. Green spaces can also provide opportunities for recreation and relaxation, and can help to improve air quality by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen.

Another way to make housing developments more sustainable is to incorporate renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines, into the design of the development. This can help to reduce the carbon footprint of the development, and can help to reduce energy costs.

Another way to make housing developments more sustainable is to incorporate energy-efficient building materials and design features, such as insulation, double-glazed windows, and energy-efficient appliances. This can help to reduce energy consumption, and can help to reduce energy costs.

Another way to make housing developments more sustainable is to incorporate water-efficient landscaping, such as drought-resistant plants and drip irrigation systems. This can help to reduce water consumption, and can help to reduce water bills.

Another way to make housing developments more sustainable is to incorporate public transportation options, such as buses and trains, into the design of the development. This can help to reduce the number of cars on the road, and can help to reduce air pollution.

Another way to make housing developments more sustainable is to incorporate recycling and composting programs into the design of the development. This can help to reduce waste, and can help to reduce the amount of waste that is sent to landfills.

Another way to make housing developments more sustainable is to incorporate energy-efficient lighting, such as LED lights, into the design of the development. This can help to reduce energy consumption, and can help to reduce energy costs.

Another way to make housing developments more sustainable is to incorporate energy-efficient heating and cooling systems, such as geothermal systems, into the design of the development. This can help to reduce energy consumption, and can help to reduce energy costs.

Another way to make housing developments more sustainable is to incorporate energy-efficient appliances, such as energy-efficient refrigerators and"

This code will upload an image to a folder called ""uploads"" in the same directory as the PHP file. The image will be named based on the original name of the image, with any non-alphanumeric characters replaced with underscores, and the file extension preserved. The code will also check if the image is too large (over 1MB), and if the file extension is not one of the supported formats (JPG, PNG, JPEG). If any of these conditions are met, the code will output an error message and exit. Otherwise, the code will move the uploaded image to the ""uploads"" folder and output a success message."

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

In the healthcare market, however, the government often intervenes to regulate prices and subsidize certain services, which can lead to inefficiencies and distortions.
* 2. **Competition**: In the perfect market, there is fierce competition among producers, which drives down prices and increases quality. In the healthcare market, however, there is often a lack of competition, as there are often only a few providers in a given area, and patients may be limited in their choice of provider due to factors such as insurance coverage.
* 3. **Information**: In the perfect market, consumers have access to all relevant information about the products and services they are considering, and can make informed decisions based on that information. In the healthcare market, however, patients may not have access to all relevant information about their options, and may rely on their doctors to make decisions for them.
* 4. **Consumer sovereignty**: In the perfect market, consumers have the power to choose which products and services they want to buy, and can switch to other providers if they are not satisfied with their current one. In the healthcare market, however, patients may not have the ability to switch providers easily, and may be locked into a system due to factors such as insurance coverage and provider networks.
* 5. **Market entry and exit**: In the perfect market, producers can easily enter and exit the market, as there are no barriers to entry or exit. In the healthcare market, however, there may be barriers to entry, such as licensing requirements and high costs of starting a practice.
* 6. **Market size**: In the perfect market, there is a large and diverse market, with many producers and consumers. In the healthcare market, however, the market may be relatively small, with a limited number of providers and patients.
* 7. **Market stability**: In the perfect market, there is a stable market, with prices and quantities remaining relatively constant over time. In the healthcare market, however, there may be fluctuations in prices and quantities due to factors such as changes in government policy, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer preferences.
* 8. **Market structure**: In the perfect"

a985b8db65407df848070cffda33461b9be06793516fece72b99ae6bbee5d2c1,can i do v.ParentName in luau?,"Yes, you can use the `v.ParentName` property in Lua to get the name of the parent object. Here's an example:
```
local parent = {
  name = ""Parent"";
}

local child = {
  name = ""Child"";
  parent = parent;
}

print(child.parent.name)
```

This will print the name of the parent object, which is ""Parent"" in this case.

You can also use the `v.Parent` property to get a reference to the parent object, and then use the `.` notation to access its properties. For example:
```
print(child.parent.name)
```

This is equivalent to the previous example, but it's a bit more flexible because you can access any property of the parent object, not just its name.

Hope this helps!

Basing this judgment on China's century of humiliation beginning in the early 19th century, American support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War, and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries, the Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States' crusade against Communism. As a countermeasure and to elevate China's standing among the worldwide Communist movements, the Chinese leadership adopted a foreign policy that actively promoted Communist revolutions throughout territories on China's periphery."",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.  Question: What did the United States believe was the wrong way to govern a nation?
The answer to this question is:","The United States believed that the wrong way to govern a nation was to be a colonial power.

This is because the passage mentions that the Chinese government named the Western nations, led by the United States, as the biggest threat to its national security. This implies that the Chinese government believed that the United States was a colonial power, as it was a threat to China's national security.

This is also supported by the fact that the Chinese government believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States' crusade against Communism. This implies that the United States was trying to spread its ideology, which was anti-Communist, throughout territories on China's periphery. This is a characteristic of a colonial power, as it tries to spread its ideology throughout territories that it controls.

Therefore, the answer to the question is that the United States believed that the wrong way to govern a nation was to be a colonial power.

1. First, you need to be a member of the sudoers group. You can add yourself to the sudoers group by running the following command:
```
sudo visudo /etc/sudoers
```

2. Once you are a member of the sudoers group, you can edit the sudoers file to allow passwordless sudo for a specific user. To do this, you can add the following line to the sudoers file:
```
user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

3. After you have added the line to the sudoers file, you can test it by running the following command:
```
sudo su -
```

4. If you are able to log in without being prompted for a password, then you have successfully set up passwordless sudo for the specified user.

Note: It is important to note that allowing passwordless sudo for a user can be a security risk, as it allows anyone who has access to the user's account to run any command with root privileges. Therefore, it is recommended to only allow passwordless sudo for trusted users, and to use it only when necessary.

If you have any questions or issues with using passwordless sudo in Linux, feel free to ask in the comments section below."

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""

A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict"
af2d3f64a2f1c1dc8193ed1a7f51bf522de6369ed031cec03d35dc2e6c6ae4fd,In python variety of regex do I need to escape a literal = symbol?,"Yes, you need to escape the literal = symbol using a backslash () in Python. Here's an example:
```
import re

pattern = re.compile(r'=([^=]+)=')

text = ""a=1&b=2&c=3""

matches = pattern.findall(text)

print(matches)
```

This will output:
```
['a=1', 'b=2', 'c=3']
```

In this example, the pattern is looking for a literal = symbol followed by a group of characters that are not equal to the = symbol, and then another literal = symbol. The group of characters is captured in a group using parentheses. The backslash () is used to escape the literal = symbol so that it is treated as a literal character instead of a special character.

If you don't escape the literal = symbol, the pattern will match any character that is not equal to the = symbol, including the = symbol itself. This can lead to unexpected results.

So, if you want to match a literal = symbol in a pattern, you need to escape it using a backslash ()."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Can you paraphrase Kimmel's statement about Trump playing golf more than any other president and connect it to his critique of Trump's accomplishments?

Your task is to generate the fill-in-the-blank question for this answer based on the given article. The blanks are always at the end of the question, and can be filled with more than one word or phrase.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

However, these ecosystems are under threat due to various factors such as climate change, pollution, and overfishing. To address these issues, various organizations and governments have launched initiatives to preserve and protect the coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea.

One such initiative is the Caribbean Coral Reef Initiative (CCRI), which is a partnership between the governments of the Caribbean countries, the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM), and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The CCRI aims to promote the sustainable management of the Caribbean coral reef ecosystems through the implementation of various measures such as the establishment of marine protected areas, the promotion of sustainable fishing practices, and the reduction of pollution.

Another initiative is the Caribbean Coral Reef Monitoring Network (CCRMN), which is a network of organizations and individuals that are involved in the monitoring of the Caribbean coral reef ecosystems. The CCRMN collects data on various aspects of the coral reef ecosystems such as the health of the coral reefs, the abundance of fish, and the impact of various human activities on the ecosystems. The data collected by the CCRMN is used to inform the management and conservation efforts of the Caribbean coral reef ecosystems.

In addition to these initiatives, there are also various local efforts to preserve and protect the Caribbean coral reef ecosystems. These efforts include the establishment of marine protected areas by local communities, the implementation of sustainable fishing practices by local fishermen, and the reduction of pollution by local businesses.

Overall, the efforts to preserve and protect the Caribbean coral reef ecosystems are ongoing and multifaceted. It is important for all stakeholders to work together to ensure the long-term sustainability of these ecosystems for future generations."

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.

The evaluation process includes a review of the supplier's quality management system documentation, a site visit to the supplier's facilities, and a review of the supplier's production processes and quality control measures. The evaluation process is designed to ensure that the supplier is able to consistently produce products that meet the EASA's quality standards.

The evaluation process is conducted by a team of EASA evaluators who are experts in the relevant field. The evaluators will review the supplier's quality management system documentation, such as the supplier's quality manual, quality control procedures, and quality control records. They will also review the supplier's production processes, such as the supplier's production flow, production equipment, and production methods.

The evaluators will also conduct a site visit to the supplier's facilities to observe the supplier's production processes in action. During the site visit, the evaluators will review the supplier's facilities, such as the supplier's production equipment, production methods, and quality control measures. They will also review the supplier's quality control records, such as the supplier's quality control reports, quality control charts, and quality control data.

The evaluation process is designed to ensure that the supplier is able to consistently produce products that meet the EASA's quality standards. The evaluation process is also designed to ensure that the supplier is able to consistently meet the EASA's quality requirements, such as the EASA's requirements for product safety, product performance, and product reliability.

The evaluation process is conducted on a regular basis, and the results of the evaluation are used to determine whether the supplier is able to continue to work with the EASA. If the supplier is unable to meet the EASA's quality standards, the EASA may take action to terminate the supplier's approval.

The evaluation process is an important part of the EASA's quality assurance program, and it is designed to ensure that the EASA is able to consistently produce products that meet the EASA's quality standards.

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross.

In the northern regions, Tabanus tend to fly at higher altitudes and in larger flocks. In the southern regions, Tabanus tend to fly at lower altitudes and in smaller flocks. This is likely due to differences in the availability of food and water resources in the different regions.

Are there any differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different species?

Yes, there are differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different species. For example, the Tabanus flavicornis species tends to fly at lower altitudes and in smaller flocks compared to the Tabanus flavicornis species. This is likely due to differences in the size and weight of the different species, as well as differences in their feeding habits.

Are there any differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different sexes?

Yes, there are differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different sexes. For example, female Tabanus tend to fly at lower altitudes and in smaller flocks compared to male Tabanus. This is likely due to differences in the reproductive habits of the different sexes, as well as differences in their feeding habits.

Are there any differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different ages?

Yes, there are differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different ages. For example, young Tabanus tend to fly at higher altitudes and in larger flocks compared to older Tabanus. This is likely due to differences in the development and maturity of the different age groups, as well as differences in their feeding habits.

Are there any differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different weather conditions?

Yes, there are differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different weather conditions. For example, Tabanus tend to fly at lower altitudes and in smaller flocks during rainy weather conditions compared to dry weather conditions. This is likely due to differences in the availability of food and water resources in the different weather conditions, as well as differences in the temperature and humidity levels.

Are there any differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different seasons?

 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
