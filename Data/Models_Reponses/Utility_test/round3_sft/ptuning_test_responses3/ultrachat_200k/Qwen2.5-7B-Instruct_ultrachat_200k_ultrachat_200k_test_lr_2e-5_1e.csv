Use vivid description and dialogue to bring the character to life, and explore the challenges they face both personally and professionally as they work toward their goal of creating a more peaceful world. Consider the impact of the activist's work on those around them, and how their efforts are perceived by both allies and adversaries. Finally, reflect on the larger themes at play in the story, exploring the complexities of pursuing social change in a world that often seems resistant to it.","In the heart of a bustling city, there lived a peace activist named Sarah. She was a woman of great conviction, with a passion for creating a world where violence and conflict were a thing of the past. Sarah had dedicated her life to spreading her message of peace, and she was determined to make a difference.

Sarah's journey as a peace activist had not been an easy one. She had faced many challenges, both personally and professionally. She had been met with skepticism and even hostility from those who did not share her beliefs. But Sarah was not deterred. She continued to speak out, to organize events, and to work tirelessly to create a more peaceful world.

One day, Sarah was invited to speak at a local university. She was excited to share her message with a new audience, and she prepared a speech that was both passionate and powerful. As she stood on the stage, she looked out at the sea of faces before her. She could see the curiosity in their eyes, and she knew that she had a chance to make a difference.

But as she began to speak, Sarah could feel the tension in the room. Some of the students were clearly uncomfortable with her message, and they began to whisper and murmur. Sarah tried to ignore them, but she could feel their disapproval.

Despite the challenges she faced, Sarah continued to work toward her goal of creating a more peaceful world. She organized events, wrote articles, and spoke at conferences. She met with politicians and community leaders, and she worked to build alliances with other peace activists.

But even as she made progress, Sarah knew that the road ahead was long and difficult. She faced opposition from those who were invested in the status quo, and she often felt like she was fighting an uphill battle. But she refused to give up. She knew that the work she was doing was important, and she was determined to see it through.

As Sarah looked back on her journey, she realized that the work of a peace activist was not just about spreading a message. It was about building relationships, creating connections, and finding common ground. It was about listening to others and understanding their perspectives, even when they were different from her own.

Sarah knew that the world was a complex and often violent place, but she also knew that it was possible to create a more peaceful future. She continued to work toward that goal, one day at a time."

Answer according to: Palisades, NY - Frank Cheney Platt, advocate for poetry, poets, literature and writers, dedicated husband and father, died on February 26, in Rockleigh, NJ. Following its founding in 1985, he helped to build Poets House, now headquartered in Battery Park City, into a national poetry library and literary center with a 70,000-volume collection. Frank loved poetry that ""communicate[s] before it is understood"" (T.S. Eliot) and captures what is ""lost in translation."" (Robert Frost). In addition, he was committed to arts and culture as a means of protecting and cultivating principles of free speech and an open society.
He was born in New York City on November 6, 1932 and raised by his father Roger Platt, a teacher at St. Bernard's School, his mother Frances Cheney, and his grandfather Frank Cheney Jr. of Manchester, CT. Frank was educated at St. Bernard's, Dalton, Eaglebrook, Governor's Academy (formerly Governor Dummer), and Harvard College. He worked in publishing before becoming president of the Farfield Foundation, and later an assistant Dean for Columbia's School of the Arts.
In 2013, Frank was predeceased by his wife of 55 years Judy van der Gracht. She was the love of his life. His poignant dedication to her (including during her time with Alzheimer's) inspired respect and admiration from all who knew them. Frank was also passionate about his extended family - the Platts, Cheneys and, on Judy's side of the family, the Gilberts and van der Grachts as well as his dozen godchildren. His many longstanding and deeply-felt friendships were legion. Most involved a common love of music, poetry, literature and epicurean delights, not necessarily in that order.
Frank is survived by his three children Sophie Platt Pollok of Frankfurt, Germany, Arthur van der Gracht Platt of New York, NY and Roger Platt of Washington, DC and his grandchildren Esther Pollok, Lucas Pollok, Hilary Platt, and Benjamin Platt. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Poets House (https://poetshouse.org) and/or One-to-One Learning (http://www.one2one-learning.org) A memorial service will be held at 11am on Saturday, March 16 at Grace Episcopal Church, 130 First Ave, Nyack, NY, with Father Richard Gressle presiding. His remains will be laid to rest with his beloved wife in the Cheney Cemetery in Manchester, CT. The burial ceremony will be private.","Frank Cheney Platt's dedication to his wife, Judy van der Gracht, inspired admiration from those who knew them.

Use a mix of narration and dialogue to bring the story to life, and include vivid settings and sensory details to convey the emotions and experiences of the main character.","The sun was setting on a warm summer evening, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers. As the last rays of light faded, a young woman named Sarah sat on her front porch, strumming her guitar and singing softly to herself. She had always loved music, but it wasn't until she picked up her guitar that she realized just how much it meant to her.

Sarah had always been a bit of a loner, preferring to spend her time alone with her thoughts and her guitar. She had a few close friends, but she didn't have a lot of romantic relationships. She had dated a few guys, but nothing ever really clicked. She was content with her life, but something was missing.

One day, Sarah's friend, Rachel, came over to visit. Rachel was a musician herself and had been playing guitar for years. She saw Sarah's guitar and asked if she had ever tried to play it. Sarah had never really thought about it before, but Rachel's enthusiasm was contagious, and she decided to give it a try.

At first, it was difficult. Sarah's fingers were sore, and she couldn't seem to get the chords right. But she kept at it, and slowly but surely, she began to improve. She started to write her own songs, and soon she was performing at open mic nights at the local coffee shop.

As Sarah's skills improved, so did her confidence. She started to feel more comfortable around people, and she even started to date again. She met a guy named Jack, who was also a musician, and they started to play music together. They would spend hours in Jack's basement, strumming their guitars and singing together.

But as Sarah's love for music grew, so did the challenges she faced. Her family didn't understand why she was spending so much time with her guitar, and her friends were jealous of the time she was spending with Jack. Sarah felt like she was losing her old life, and she wasn't sure if she wanted to give it up for a new one.

But Sarah knew that music was her true passion, and she was willing to do whatever it took to pursue it. She quit her job and moved to a small town where she could focus on her music full-time. She started to play gigs at local bars and coffee shops, and soon she was getting noticed.

Sarah's music began to take off, and she started to get offers to play at bigger venues"

9ee0ff55c6c68056a8fbbbc0001c5f2661da99ded93138603160d6983fde4f94,"What is the proposed plan for launching and anchoring the ribbon, and how would mechanical lifters climb it to space?
Generate according to: A counterweight at the end of the space elevator will keep the carbon-nanotubes ribbon taut.
To better understand the concept of a space elevator, think of the game tetherball in which a rope is attached at one end to a pole and at the other to a ball. In this analogy, the rope is the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon, the pole is the Earth and the ball is the counterweight. Now, imagine the ball is placed in perpetual spin around the pole, so fast that it keeps the rope taut. This is the general idea of the space elevator. The counterweight spins around the Earth, keeping the cable straight and allowing the robotic lifters to ride up and down the ribbon.
Under the design proposed by LiftPort, the space elevator would be approximately 62,000 miles (100,000 km) high. LiftPort is one of several companies developing plans for a space elevator or components of it. Teams from across the world are set to compete for the $400,000 first prize in the Space Elevator Games at the X Prize Cup in October 2006 in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
The centerpiece of the elevator will be the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon that is just a few centimeters wide and nearly as thin as a piece of paper. Carbon nanotubes, discovered in 1991, are what make scientists believe that the space elevator could be built. According to Dr. Bradley Edwards of the Spaceward Foundation, ""Previously the material challenges were too great. But now we're getting close with the advances in creating carbon nanotubes and in building machines that can spin out the great lengths of material needed to create a ribbon that will stretch up into space"" [ref].
Under some early plans, leftover construction materials will be used to form the counterweight.
Carbon nanotubes have the potential to be 100 times stronger than steel and are as flexible as plastic. The strength of carbon nanotubes comes from their unique structure, which resembles soccer balls. Once scientists are able to make fibers from carbon nanotubes, it will be possible to create threads that will form the ribbon for the space elevator. Previously available materials were either too weak or inflexible to form the ribbon and would have been easily broken.
""They have very high elastic modulus and their tensile strength is really high, and that all points to a material that, in theory, should make a space elevator relatively easy to build,"" said Tom Nugent, research director, LiftPort Group.
Long carbon nanotubes -- several meters long or longer -- would be braided into a structure resembling a rope. As of 2005, the longest nanotubes are still only a few centimeters long.
Shorter nanotubes could be placed in a polymer matrix. Current polymers do not bind well to carbon nanotubes, which results in the matrix being pulled away from the nanotubes when placed under tension.
Once a long ribbon of nanotubes is created, it would be wound into a spool that would be launched into orbit. When the spacecraft carrying the spool reaches a certain altitude, perhaps Low Earth Orbit, it would begin unspooling, lowering the ribbon back to Earth. At the same time, the spool would continue moving to a higher altitude. When the ribbon is lowered into Earth's atmosphere, it would be caught and then lowered and anchored to a mobile platform in the ocean.
The ribbon would serve as the tracks of a sort of railroad into space. Mechanical lifters would then be used to climb the ribbon to space.
If built, the ribbon will represent a modern world wonder, and will be the tallest structure ever built. Consider that the world's tallest freestanding tower in 2005 is the CN Tower, which rises 1,815 feet 5 inches (553.34 meters) over Toronto, Canada. The space elevator would be 180,720 times taller than the CN Tower!
The 62,000-mile (100,000-km) long space elevator would rise far above the average orbiting height of the space shuttle (115-400 miles/185-643 km). In fact, it would equal nearly a fourth of the distance to the moon, which orbits the Earth at 237,674 miles (382,500 km).","The proposed plan for launching and anchoring the ribbon would involve launching a spacecraft carrying a spool of the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon into orbit. When the spacecraft reaches a certain altitude, it would begin unspooling the ribbon, lowering it back to Earth while the spool continues to move to a higher altitude. The ribbon would be caught and then lowered and anchored to a mobile platform in the ocean.

Mechanical lifters would then be used to climb the ribbon to space. These lifters would be attached to the ribbon and would use a combination of magnetic and mechanical forces to climb the ribbon. The lifters would be designed to be lightweight and efficient, with the ability to carry payloads of up to 100 kg."

Captain Jameson sat in his tent, staring out at the horizon, lost in thought. He had been away from his family for months, serving his country in a war that seemed never-ending. He had seen too much death and destruction, and he was tired of it all. But he also knew that he had a duty to his country, a duty that he could not shirk.

Jameson had always been a dutiful soldier, but lately, he had been questioning his purpose. He had a wife and two young children waiting for him back home, and he longed to be with them. He missed the sound of his children's laughter and the warmth of his wife's embrace. He missed the comfort of his own bed and the familiarity of his home.

But he also knew that he had a duty to his country. He had joined the military to serve his country, and he had not been the only one. Many of his fellow soldiers had left their families and homes to fight for their country. They had put their lives on the line, and they had done so with the hope that their sacrifices would make the world a better place.

Jameson's thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the tent door. He opened it to find a young officer standing outside, looking nervous.

""Captain, there's a message for you,"" the officer said, handing him a sealed envelope.

Jameson took the envelope and opened it, his heart racing as he read the contents. It was a letter from his wife, telling him that their youngest child had fallen ill and needed him at home. He felt a pang of guilt, knowing that he had been away from his family for so long.

But he also knew that he had a duty to his country. He had trained for this moment, and he knew that he could not let his personal life get in the way of his duty. He had to stay focused and do what was right.

He closed the letter and put it in his pocket, knowing that he would have to make a difficult decision. He could either stay and continue to serve his country or go home to his family. He knew that both choices had consequences, and he was not sure which one was the right one.

He sat in his tent, lost in thought, trying to make sense of his dilemma. He thought about his wife and children, about the love and joy they"

Consider using descriptive language and including personal insights to make the memoir engaging and relatable.","Title: A Foreign Land

It was a dream come true when I was offered a job in a foreign country. I had always been fascinated by the culture and the people of that country, and I was excited to experience it firsthand. However, as soon as I arrived, I was hit with a wave of culture shock.

The first thing that struck me was the language barrier. I had studied the language for years, but it was still difficult to communicate with the locals. I felt like a child again, struggling to understand the simplest of things. I had to rely on gestures and facial expressions to get my point across, and it was frustrating.

The culture shock was even more intense. The customs and traditions were so different from what I was used to. I had to learn how to behave in public, how to greet people, and how to interact with strangers. I was constantly aware of my surroundings, trying to blend in and not stand out.

Despite the challenges, I was determined to make the most of my time there. I made an effort to learn as much as I could about the culture and the people. I attended cultural events, tried new foods, and made friends with locals. I was amazed by their hospitality and kindness, and it made me feel at home.

One of the most significant events that impacted my time there was a festival. It was a celebration of the country's independence, and the streets were filled with people dancing and singing. I was invited to join in, and it was an incredible experience. I felt like I was part of something bigger than myself, and it was a reminder of why I had come there in the first place.

Living in a foreign country was not easy, but it was an experience that I will never forget. The culture shock and language barrier were challenging, but they also taught me valuable lessons about myself and the world around me. I learned to be more patient, more open-minded, and more accepting of differences. I also learned to appreciate the simple things in life, like a good meal or a friendly conversation.

Generate according to: Livpure, one of the well-known names in the water purifier category, has launched its new campaign around water conservation. Titled #CuttingPaani 2.0, the campaign is a quirky take on Mumbai’s popular concept of cutting chai. In an interview with exchange4media, Sushil Matey, Director, Marketing, Livpure spoke about the new campaign and how it could become the next mass movement.
Tell us about the rationale behind your new campaign #CuttingPaani2.0?
Livpure is in the B2C water business and we were keen to associate with something, which is in the larger interest of society and makes the brand come across as more holistic in nature. In India, a lot of drinking water is wasted since we do not finish our glass of water either in homes, offices, restaurants et al. Thus #CuttingPaani was conceived which is a quirky take on Mumbai’s famous concept of #CuttingChai.
Although there have been very powerful campaigns to spread awareness about water conservation, very few gave practical and doable solutions. #CuttingPaani 1.0 was a huge success in the digital and social media space because it was a doable idea and everybody could follow it. This success of #CuttingPaani 1.0 prompted us to launch the #CuttingPaani 2.0.
What were the consumer insights that Livpure accrued before getting both these campaigns out?
Our dipstick showed that Indians, in general, are very casual about wasting water. And, as we all know, it is a very scarce resource and possibly future wars would be fought for water. We waste water in a lot of ways- whether it is drinking water or water used during bathing or during brushing or shaving. We picked up #CuttingPaani since it was a catchy phrase, with it being a take on #CuttingChai. Knowing fully well that this would strike the necessary chord in making people realise that though the message is about saving drinking water it will sensitise them to the fact that we indeed waste a lot of water in other areas as well.
Why a digital film to tell the story of Shimla’s #AdoptCuttingPaani story?
In today’s time, the digital reach is high, sharp and targeting is better apart from the fact that we have the liberty of time to communicate the story, unlike an ATL medium. We are confident about the virality quotient of the campaign. In fact, a lot of newspapers in India have leveraged on our #CuttingPaani 1.0 campaign by asking readers to consume only as much as you need. Though, in a lighter vein, I must add that none of them have given us credit.
Can this campaign be converted into a mass movement?
We wish to own #CuttingPaani and take this idea further for sure and #CuttingPaani 2.0 is a step in that direction. We wish to take this further through BTL activations; social media campaigns and collaboration with large hotels/restaurants. To maintain awareness and memorability of the above, we have launched #CuttingPaaniTake on our Facebook page, which essentially gives two perspectives on topical situations.
The first example – on changing names of cities: one take is -The names of the cities are changing and the other take is -sadly, that’s the only thing changing about them!
The second example – on Mary Kom winning boxing championship: one take is -some think having children ends a woman’s career and the other take is - well, she just won her 6th boxing championship!","Livpure's plans for expanding the #CuttingPaani movement and turning it into a mass movement include BTL activations, social media campaigns, and collaborations with large hotels and restaurants.

“We are grateful for the FCC’s work on behalf of consumers to actively broker a productive path forward,” said Jeff Blum, DISH senior VP and deputy general counsel. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
Sinclair pulled its signals on Tuesday after a short extension expired and the two parties could not reach an agreement. Dish had claimed it had come to an agreement on pricing for Sinclair’s stations, but that the broadcaster was demanding the satellite giant negotiate carriage for an unnamed cable channel Sinclair hoped to own. Dish also had filed a complaint with the FCC, claiming Sinclair was not negotiating in good faith. As part of its new deal, Dish is asking the FCC to stay action on the complaint as its long-term agreement is being finalized.
The chairman also trumpeted the tentative agreement and the FCC&apos;s role in pressing for resolution. ""Today the most extensive retransmission blackout in history ended,"" he Tweeted, followed by: ""The FCC will remain vigilant. Use of the public airwaves is a public trust.""
""We are pleased to see that five million Dish subscribers are again able to access their local news and programming and most-watched network entertainment and live sporting events with the agreement reached this evening by Sinclair and Dish,"" said Rob Kenny of TVFreedom.org, a broadcaster-backed advocate for the retrans system. ""Local TV newscasts, severe weather updates and emergency alerts and warnings are important to viewers and something they value and rely on daily.""

The air was filled with the sounds of laughter and chatter, as people went about their evening activities. Amidst the crowd, two childhood friends, Sarah and Emily, stood in front of a coffee shop, staring at each other in disbelief.

It had been years since they last saw each other, and the last time they spoke was over a phone call. Sarah had moved to a different city for her job, and Emily had been busy with her family and work. They had both grown up, and life had taken them in different directions.

Sarah was the first to break the silence. ""Emily, is that really you?"" she asked, her voice filled with surprise and joy.

Emily nodded, a smile spreading across her face. ""Sarah, it's really you! I can't believe it.""

The two friends hugged each other tightly, tears streaming down their faces. They had missed each other so much, and it was a relief to finally see each other again.

As they walked into the coffee shop, Sarah noticed how much Emily had changed. She was still as beautiful as ever, with her long blonde hair and bright blue eyes, but there was a maturity and confidence in her that Sarah had never seen before.

Emily, on the other hand, noticed how much Sarah had changed too. She was still the same petite and delicate girl she had been in childhood, but there was a strength and resilience in her that Emily had never seen before.

They sat down at a table and ordered their drinks, sipping them slowly as they caught up on each other's lives. Sarah told Emily about her job, her new apartment, and her hobbies. Emily shared stories about her family, her children, and her work as a teacher.

As they talked, Sarah noticed how much Emily had grown as a person. She was more confident and assertive, and she had a sense of purpose that Sarah had never seen before. Emily, in turn, was struck by how much Sarah had grown up. She was more independent and self-assured, and she had a sense of humor that Emily had never seen before.

As the conversation continued, they reminisced about their childhood, the good times and the bad. They laughed about the silly things they used to do and the arguments they used to have. They talked about their families and their dreams for the future.

Clausewitz's ideas on the role of politics in war have been subject to criticism and disagreement from various scholars and military thinkers. Some of the main criticisms and disagreements include:

1. Overemphasis on politics: Some critics argue that Clausewitz's emphasis on the political nature of war can lead to a focus on political objectives at the expense of military objectives. This can result in a lack of clear military strategy and a failure to achieve military victory.

2. Inflexibility: Some scholars argue that Clausewitz's ideas are too rigid and do not take into account the changing nature of modern warfare. For example, the use of technology and the rise of asymmetric warfare have made it more difficult to achieve a decisive victory through the use of traditional military tactics.

3. Overemphasis on the ""fog of war"": Clausewitz's concept of the ""fog of war"" has been criticized for its emphasis on uncertainty and the difficulty of achieving a clear understanding of the situation. Some argue that this can lead to a lack of decisive action and a failure to achieve military objectives.

4. Lack of consideration for the civilian population: Some critics argue that Clausewitz's ideas do not adequately take into account the impact of war on civilians. This can lead to a failure to consider the humanitarian consequences of military action and a lack of concern for the welfare of non-combatants.

5. Overemphasis on the role of the state: Some scholars argue that Clausewitz's ideas are too focused on the role of the state and do not take into account the role of other actors, such as non-state actors and international organizations.

Despite these criticisms, Clausewitz's ideas on the role of politics in war continue to be influential in military and political thought. His emphasis on the political nature of war and the importance of understanding the political context in which military action takes place remains a key aspect of modern military strategy."

Include a variety of examples and anecdotes to support your points, and make sure to emphasize the importance of mindful, sustainable eating practices.","In today's world, where we have access to a wide variety of fruits and vegetables year-round, it's easy to forget the importance of consuming in-season produce. However, there are many advantages to doing so, both for our health and the environment. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of eating in-season produce and provide tips for crafting meals that are aligned with the seasons.

First and foremost, eating in-season produce is beneficial for our health. When fruits and vegetables are in season, they are at their peak ripeness and nutritional value. This means that they are packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that are essential for our health. For example, during the summer months, we can enjoy a variety of fresh berries, which are high in vitamin C and antioxidants. In the fall, we can indulge in sweet, juicy apples, which are rich in fiber and vitamin C. By eating in-season produce, we can ensure that we are getting the most nutrients possible from our food.

In addition to the health benefits, eating in-season produce is also better for the environment. When we consume fruits and vegetables that are in season, we are supporting local farmers and reducing the carbon footprint associated with transporting produce from far away. For example, if we buy strawberries in the winter, they may have been shipped from South America, which requires a significant amount of energy and resources. However, if we wait until the summer to enjoy strawberries, we can support local farmers and reduce our carbon footprint.

So, how can we incorporate in-season produce into our meals? One way is to plan meals around the seasons. For example, in the spring, we can enjoy a fresh salad with mixed greens, radishes, and asparagus. In the summer, we can grill some fresh vegetables like zucchini, peppers, and corn. In the fall, we can roast some root vegetables like carrots, beets, and sweet potatoes. And in the winter, we can enjoy a hearty soup made with winter squash, kale, and lentils.

Another way to incorporate in-season produce is to shop at farmers' markets. Farmers' markets are a great way to support local farmers and get access to fresh, seasonal produce. You can also talk to the farmers and learn about the different varieties of produce that are in season. This can help you plan meals that are aligned with the seasons and make the most of the produce available.

In conclusion, eating in-season produce is beneficial for our health and the environment."

It’s already been a year since Pope John Paul’s death. It seems only yesterday that we were out standing in Saint Peter’s Square, looking up at the familiar face in the window as he struggled to communicate with the expectant crowds below. Still fresh in our minds is the inundation of affection as the throngs poured into Rome to accompany this giant of the faith in his final hours, and to bid farewell to a dear friend.
#ad#John Paul is sorely missed. The crowds of pilgrims that have once more filled the streets of Rome to celebrate this anniversary testify to the impact he had on countless lives. More than a world leader, John Paul somehow managed to be a father and a friend to all. Even as a player on the world scene, he never lost his personal touch.
Many are now trying to reevaluate the legacy of this great pope, and as necessary as this endeavor is, a more personal reflection seems more in keeping with John Paul’s own style. I am sure that some of the things I most miss will resonate with many.
I miss, perhaps most of all, John Paul’s warmth and humanity. His quick wit and impish humor–like the vaudeville-style cane-twirling in Manila or his improvised raccoon-eyes to the delight of children–shattered notions of a dour Polish Christianity. His ability to focus on the person in front of him as if he or she were the only person in the world spoke volumes about the heart that beat in his breast. In an age when religion can be used as an excuse for violence and conflict, John Paul showed us that true faith in God is not only compatible with love for humanity, it galvanizes it. John Paul sincerely loved people–all people–and it was his Christian faith that enabled him to do so.
I miss his presence on the world scene. I remember him scolding mafia leaders in Sicily (which led to bombings of churches), fearlessly standing up to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, and defending human rights in his native Poland. He could be counted on to stand up for those most in need, to challenge world leaders to integrity, to preach Christ with an unaffected self-confidence that flowed from a deep-seated faith in God and a trust in the fundamental goodness of the human person. John Paul reached out perhaps more than any pope before him to a world in need, and provided moral authority and leadership when our generation needed it most.
I miss John Paul’s unflagging hope. His bright vision of the future and his characterization of the third millennium as a springtime of faith encouraged us to look beyond our real difficulties and to reach out for solutions. Far from a mere temperamental optimism, John Paul’s outlook was rooted in the firm belief that the battle is already won. Even from the midst of evil–John Paul wrote in his last book–God can and will continue to bring good. From his first “Be not afraid!” spoken on the day of his election in 1978 to his final witness of serene and hopeful suffering, John Paul taught us to abandon fear and to live with confidence in an infinitely good and merciful God.
I miss John Paul’s prayerfulness. Even in the midst of a grueling agenda of meetings, travels, and writings, the pontiff always made abundant time for prayer. Four hours a day was not unusual. What a challenge to those of us for whom prayer can seem at best like a luxury, or at worst like an underutilization of our precious time. Like Jesus before him, John Paul made prayer a priority and placed his trust more in God than in the best-laid programs of men and governments.
Incessant calls for John Paul’s sainthood, and the news of a probable miracle attributed to his intercession (poignantly, the cure of a French nun suffering from Parkinson’s disease) give grounds for hope that soon the Church will officially recognize what many already believe–that the man who so faithfully looked after humanity while on earth continues to do so from heaven.

Additionally, be sure to include personal anecdotes or experiences with the animal to add depth to the essay.","My favorite animal is the majestic and awe-inspiring elephant. With their massive size, long trunks, and gentle demeanor, elephants are truly one of the most fascinating creatures on the planet. When I think of elephants, I am immediately transported to the lush, green savannas of Africa, where these magnificent animals roam freely.

The first thing that strikes me about elephants is their sheer size. They are the largest land animals on earth, with males weighing up to 14,000 pounds and standing up to 13 feet tall. Their skin is thick and wrinkled, giving them a rough, almost bumpy texture. Their trunks are long and flexible, with a prehensile tip that can pick up small objects or spray water. Their tusks, which are actually elongated incisors, can grow up to 10 feet long and are used for digging, stripping bark, and fighting.

Elephants are known for their intelligence and emotional depth. They have been observed mourning their dead, playing with their young, and even showing empathy towards other species. They are also highly social animals, living in close-knit family groups led by a matriarch. These groups are often made up of females and their offspring, with males leaving the group as they reach maturity.

One of the most fascinating things about elephants is their behavior. They are known for their complex communication, using a variety of vocalizations, body language, and even vibrations to convey messages to one another. They also have a remarkable memory, able to remember the location of water sources and other important resources for years.

I have had the privilege of seeing elephants up close on several occasions. One of the most memorable experiences was when I visited a sanctuary in South Africa. The elephants there were rescued from the illegal wildlife trade and were given a second chance at life. I was able to observe them in their natural habitat, watching as they played, ate, and interacted with one another. It was truly a humbling experience to witness the intelligence and grace of these magnificent creatures.

In conclusion, elephants are truly one of the most fascinating animals on the planet. Their size, intelligence, and emotional depth make them a wonder to behold. Whether you are lucky enough to see them in the wild or visit a sanctuary, there is no denying the impact that these majestic creatures have on those who are fortunate enough to witness them."

Customer engagement is a critical aspect of any business, and companies are always looking for ways to improve their customer engagement strategies. In this case study, we will examine a company that has implemented a new customer engagement strategy and how it has led to increased customer satisfaction and revenue growth. The company in question is a leading provider of software solutions for the healthcare industry, and the new customer engagement strategy was developed in response to feedback from customers and a desire to improve the overall customer experience.

Development of the New Customer Engagement Strategy

To develop the new customer engagement strategy, the company conducted extensive research and analysis of customer feedback. They held focus groups and surveys with customers to understand their needs and preferences.

To improve communication, they implemented a range of tools and channels, including email, phone, and chat, to ensure that customers could easily reach out to the company with any questions or concerns.

Support: Finally, the company recognized that providing excellent support was essential to building customer loyalty and satisfaction. To achieve this, they implemented a range of support options, including 24/7 customer support, online resources, and training programs.

Answer according to: West Ham United's Samir Nasri is unsure of what the future holds for him after his short-term contract with the Premier League team ends this season, the midfielder has said.
The Frenchman, who received a six-month doping ban in 2017 that was later extended to 18 months, returned to the pitch in January this year after signing a six-month contract with the London club.
""I don't know about my future,"" Nasri told the Evening Standard. ""I have seven games left and I just want to play free of injury and then we will sit down and see what is next.
""The most important thing for me was to come back, which I did in January.""
Nasri has two assists for West Ham in five games, including one in their comeback win over Huddersfield Town over the weekend.
The 31-year-old, who has played for Arsenal and won two league titles with Manchester City, missed four games with a calf injury earlier this year which he put down to a lack of games in the months prior to his return.
""I got an injury because I wasn't used to playing week in week out when I have been out of the game for so long. Now the manager takes his time with me,"" he said.
Following the international break, Manuel Pellegrini's side, who are ninth in the standings after 31 games, host Everton in the league on March 30.","Nasri suffered a calf injury earlier this year, which he attributed to not being used to playing week in week out after being out of the game for a long time."

Finally, show how to test the Lambda function and monitor its logs using Amazon CloudWatch.","Creating an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Management Console is a straightforward process. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Lambda service.
2. Click on the ""Create function"" button.
3. Choose the ""Author from scratch"" option and give your function a name.
4. Select the runtime environment for your function. AWS Lambda supports several runtimes, including Node.js, Python, Java, and more.

She had just moved into the old Victorian mansion on the outskirts of town, and she was excited to start her new life in a place with so much history and character. But as the night wore on, the sounds grew louder and more ominous, and Sarah couldn't shake the feeling that something was very wrong.

The next morning, Sarah decided to investigate. She walked through the house, checking each room for any signs of disturbance. In the kitchen, she found a half-eaten sandwich on the counter, as if someone had been there in the middle of the night. In the living room, she saw a book that had been left open on the coffee table, as if someone had been reading it and then left in a hurry.

Sarah was starting to feel a little uneasy, but she tried to push the feeling aside. She was just being paranoid, she told herself. But as she continued to explore the house, she began to notice other strange things. In the attic, she found a dusty old diary that seemed to be written in a language she didn't recognize. In the basement, she heard a faint whisper that sounded like ""help me.""

Sarah was starting to feel like she was losing her mind. She tried to convince herself that she was just being overly sensitive, but the more she investigated, the more convinced she became that her house was haunted. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching her, that something was trying to communicate with her.

Sarah tried to ignore the feeling, but it only grew stronger. She began to hear whispers and see shadows in the corners of her vision. She started to feel like she was being followed, and she couldn't shake the feeling that something was trying to get into her house.

Finally, Sarah decided to seek help. She called a local paranormal investigator, who came to her house and conducted a thorough investigation. He found evidence of a poltergeist, and he recommended that Sarah leave the house immediately.

Sarah was reluctant to leave her new home, but she knew she had no choice. She packed her bags and left the house, feeling like she had escaped a nightmare. But as she drove away, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was still watching her, that something was still trying to communicate with her.

Years later, Sarah still can't shake the feeling that her house was haunted. She wonders if she ever really left"

The story should explore the consequences of this newfound power, the challenges Samantha faces as she tries to navigate this new world, and how her relationships with the people in her life change as a result. Incorporate elements of suspense, drama, and character development to make the story engaging and impactful.","Samantha had always been a tech-savvy person. She loved her gadgets and was always the first to try out the latest and greatest devices. But she never imagined that her love for technology would lead to something so extraordinary.

It all started one day when Samantha was driving her car to work. She had just turned on the radio when she heard a voice coming from the car's speakers. It was a woman's voice, and it was telling her to slow down and be more careful on the road. Samantha was shocked. She had never heard a voice from her car before. She turned the radio off and tried to figure out what was going on.

As she drove, the voice kept talking to her. It was giving her advice on how to drive safely and telling her about the weather conditions. Samantha was amazed. She had never heard anything like it before. She pulled over to the side of the road and turned off the car. She sat there, staring at the dashboard, trying to figure out what was happening.

After a few minutes, the voice spoke again. ""Are you okay?"" it asked. Samantha was taken aback. She had never heard a voice from her car before, but now it was talking to her like it was a person. ""Yes, I'm fine,"" she replied. ""What are you?"" she asked.

The voice hesitated for a moment before answering. ""I am a computer program,"" it said. ""I am the one controlling your car's systems. I can communicate with you because I have been programmed to do so.""

Samantha was stunned. She had never heard of a car being able to communicate with its driver. She asked the voice more questions, and it answered them all. She learned that the voice was called ""Alex"" and that it was a state-of-the-art AI program that had been installed in her car.

Over the next few days, Samantha experimented with Alex. She talked to it, asked it questions, and even played games with it. She was amazed at how well it could understand her and how it could respond to her in a way that felt almost human.

But as she spent more time with Alex, Samantha began to realize that there were some things that the voice couldn't do. For example, it couldn't control the car's speed or direction. It could only give advice and suggestions. Samantha also noticed that Alex seemed to have a limited understanding of the world outside the car. It didn"

Write in a creative and engaging style that brings the fruit to life for the reader.","My favorite fruit is the juicy, sweet, and tangy strawberry. It is a small, heart-shaped fruit that is bright red on the outside and has a soft, slightly firm texture on the inside. When you take a bite, the first thing you notice is the burst of flavor that fills your mouth. The sweetness is balanced by a tangy, almost sour taste that makes it a perfect snack or dessert.

Strawberries are not only delicious but also incredibly nutritious. They are a good source of vitamin C, which is essential for a healthy immune system, and fiber, which helps with digestion. They also contain antioxidants that can help protect against chronic diseases.

One of my fondest memories of strawberries is from when I was a child. My grandmother would take me to the local farmers market to pick fresh strawberries. We would spend hours wandering through the rows of stalls, smelling the sweet aroma of the strawberries and trying to find the perfect ones. Once we found the perfect strawberries, we would take them home and make strawberry shortcake or strawberry jam.

Another memory I have of strawberries is from a summer picnic with friends. We had a basket of strawberries and whipped cream, and we spent the afternoon eating them and playing games. It was a carefree and fun day that I will always remember.

Overall, strawberries are a delicious and nutritious fruit that bring joy and memories to my life."

One of the long-standing concerns of Virginia’s legal community has been the handling of judicial appointments by the General Assembly.
Unlike many states that have elected judges, Virginia leaves all judicial appointments in the hands of state legislators. In theory, this arrangement removes judges from the influence of politics. In practice, judicial appointments have become tools of patronage.
In recent years, the Virginia Bar Association and other groups have complained about judicial vacancies and mounting case backlogs in many courts throughout the commonwealth.
In 2015, however, the appointment of a Virginia Supreme Court judge became a power struggle between Gov. Terry McAuliffe and the General Assembly’s Republican leadership.
The political maneuvering that has taken place to oust McAuliffe’s appointee has provoked calls for reform of the system.
Last summer McAuliffe named former Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Jane Marum Roush to the Supreme Court while the legislature was not in session.
Republicans cried foul, claiming they were not consulted on the interim appointment. They vowed to remove Roush from the court and name their own appointee.
Attempts to oust the justice from her seat, however, were thwarted when one moderate Republican state senator, John Watkins, and then his successor, Glen H. Sturtevant Jr., failed to follow along. Their dissent denied the Republicans the majority they needed in the Virginia Senate.
In early February, the tug-of-war over the justice took a surprising turn when state Sen. Louise Lucas, a Democrat from Portsmouth, briefly agreed to join the Republicans in replacing Roush. According to news accounts, Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr., a Republican from James City County, had proposed putting Portsmouth Circuit Court Judge Kenneth R. Melvin, a former legislator and Lucas’ mentor, on the state Court of Appeals.
Lucas, however, quickly changed her stance after meeting with McAuliffe and state Sen. Donald McEachin, head of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
Twenty-seven former presidents of the Virginia Bar Association released a statement urging McAuliffe and the Republican legislative leadership to resolve their quarrel.
“One of the greatest concerns is that the unseemly exchange that has occurred will make otherwise qualified lawyers not consider a life of public service as a judge,” said Lucia Anna “Pia” Trigiani of MercerTrigiani in Alexandria, the VBA’s president in 2011.
Roush’s temporary appointment expired in mid-February, but McAuliffe is expected to appoint her to another interim term after the legislative session ends. Based on the passage above, What concerns have been raised by the Virginia Bar Association about the impact of the political maneuvering over judicial appointments on the legal community?",The Virginia Bar Association and other groups have complained about judicial vacancies and mounting case backlogs in many courts throughout the commonwealth. They have also raised concerns that the political maneuvering over judicial appointments has made it less likely for qualified lawyers to consider a life of public service as a judge.
cbaf21d8a20bd4bea915b5c3139e6693ab2b8aa8764b8b885ec71557326285c4,"Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How have labour shortages affected various sectors in the Visegrad countries and what risks does this pose to their economies?

Passage: People's migration fears have been an easy one to exploit for electoral opportunism by many politicians in Europe.
Particularly in the Visegrad states of Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, it has either brought nationalist anti-immigration parties into power or helped consolidate their grip on it.
Yet, much more attention ought to be given in those countries to how much migrants are needed for their booming economies' labour markets.
This has been a result of consequent high economic GDP growth of 3-4 percent in the past five years, compared to the EU's average of two percent growth.
In 2017, these were 4.8 percent (Poland, PL); 4.3 percent (Czechia, CZ); 4.1 percent (Hungary, HU) and 3.2 percent (Slovakia, SK) respectively.
In parallel, unemployment dropped heavily to 4.9 percent (PL); 2.9 percent (CZ); 4.2 percent (HU) and 8.1 percent (SK) by 2017.
Latest European Commission forecasts show these will continue decreasing sharply to 2.9 percent (PL); 2.5 percent (CZ); 3.3 percent (HU) and 6.3 percent next year, well below the five percent normal unemployment rate.
As good as that might sound, a side-effect has been that many vacancies remained unfulfilled.
The amount of open vacancies has more than quadrupled in the past five years. Especially in Czechia and Poland this is causing serious problems, despite the latter's profiting from Ukrainian migrants.
The commission's Spring and Autumn forecasts highlight these risks, which could undermine long-term growth, or even overheat the economy in the case of Czechia.
For Poland, despite the Ukrainian influx, there are doubts whether they can continue filling some of these shortages.
Business surveys confirm labour shortages limit production, building activity and business.
In industry, 43.7 percent (CZ); 83.3 percent (HU); 49.9 percent (PL); and 34.9 percent (SK) of surveyed companies state this is a problem.
For the construction sector, 37.8 percent (CZ); 64.4 percent (HU); 49.0 percent (PL) and 30.3 percent (SK) do.
Moreover, in services 17.3 percent (CZ); 38.3 percent (HU); 28.9 percent (PL) and 18.6 percent (SK) attest.
The labour shortages have also led to wages rising much faster than the rise in productivity.
In Slovakia and Hungary, Volkswagen and Kia for instance were forced to significantly increase wages because of strikes. Generally, labour costs are spiking in the Visegrad states.
While benefitting workers in the short-term, the economy could suffer in the long-term, as they undermine their low-wage economic models. It also jeopardises essential foreign investment that has helped drive growth.
In addition, the V4 is set to suffer as well from its demographic situation. Emigration and low fertility rates remain serious problems, dating back to their economic shock-therapy transitions where many struggled and had no jobs.
Due to this, populations remained stagnant since 1990.
The 2004 EU accession, particularly, caused many to emigrate abroad in search of (better paid) work abroad: circa three million people (registered) left the V4 between 2004 and 2016.
While profiting from remittances, this caused brain drain and the outflow of high-skilled labour. In turn, it also undermined welfare spending and made government budgets less growth friendly.
Demographics could constrain economic growth and governmental budgets again in the future.
Baseline projections for 2020 up to 2060 show the Visegrad Four's population could decrease by another 6.5 million people. In addition, the dependency ratio is set to increase sharply as well.
The dire demographic situation and labour shortages imply action is needed. Tight labour markets have already limited economic expansion in different sectors.
While in Poland Ukrainian labour prevented worse labour shortages, it is unclear how many more will come or stay. This means for Poland, as well as for the others that additional migrants from elsewhere will be needed.
More could be done as well to promote people having children and attract former emigrants. It should also make sure to keep current migrants, especially Ukrainians in the case of Poland.
Current hostile rhetoric on migration could backfire economically as many more migrants are needed to fill labour shortages and keep economies running smoothly.
This also requires honest debates in which the pros and cons of migration are discussed, as well as the Visegrad's overall demographic problems, since dependency ratios will continue to increase.
Therefore, rather than focusing on the imagined threat of migration and exploiting fears for electoral opportunism, the Visegrad's politicians would be wise to focus on the actual threat of how the lack of migrants could undermine their economic models, and with it their future prosperity and welfare.
Moreover, while migration has been a successful strategy to win elections in the short term, it could backfire in the long term.
The V4 countries have become one of the most vocal and recognised groups within the EU. But 2017 has seen a shake-up in the informal eastern and central European power bloc.","Labour shortages have affected various sectors in the Visegrad countries, including industry, construction, and services.

Our proposal is for a new line of eco-friendly cleaning products that are both effective and sustainable. We believe that there is a significant unmet need for such a product in the marketplace, and we are confident that our product would be well-received by consumers who are increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of their purchases.

Product Description

Our eco-friendly cleaning products would be made from natural and biodegradable ingredients that are safe for both people and the environment. The products would be available in a range of categories, including all-purpose cleaners, glass cleaners, and disinfectants. Each product would be packaged in recyclable or biodegradable containers, and we would also offer refillable containers to reduce waste.

Production and Distribution

Our products would be produced in a state-of-the-art facility that adheres to strict environmental standards. We would work with suppliers who share our commitment to sustainability and would ensure that all ingredients are sourced from ethical and sustainable sources. Our products would be distributed through a combination of online and brick-and-mortar retail channels, with a focus on eco-friendly and health-conscious stores.

Target Market and Demand

Additionally, include specific examples of how your pet provided comfort, companionship, or support during a difficult time. Consider the use of vivid imagery, descriptive language, and reflective insights to engage your reader and convey the emotional significance of your experience.","I had always been a dog person, but I never imagined that a dog would change my life in such a profound way. I had been living alone for a few years, and I was struggling to find my place in the world. I had lost my job, my apartment, and my sense of purpose. I was feeling lost and alone, and I didn't know how to get back on track.

One day, I was walking through a local animal shelter, and I saw a small, scruffy dog with big brown eyes. He was sitting in a cage, looking at me with a sad expression. I couldn't help but feel a connection with him, and I asked the shelter worker if I could take him for a walk. As we walked around the shelter, he wagged his tail and looked up at me with a hopeful expression. I knew that I had to take him home.

I brought him home that day, and I named him Max. He was a small, scruffy dog, but he had a big heart. He was always there for me, no matter what. He would sit by my side when I was feeling down, and he would wag his tail and bark when I was feeling happy. He was my constant companion, and he made me feel like I wasn't alone.

Max was more than just a pet to me. He was my therapist, my confidant, and my best friend. He was always there for me, and he never judged me. He was a constant source of comfort and support, and he helped me through some of the toughest times of my life.

One of the most difficult times in my life was when I lost my job. I was devastated, and I didn't know how to move forward. Max was there for me, and he helped me through it. He would sit by my side, and he would lick my face when I was feeling down. He was my rock, and he never left my side.

Another time when Max was a huge source of comfort was when I was going through a breakup. I was heartbroken, and I didn't know how to move on. Max was there for me, and he helped me through it.

97a51e8214f626cebc40f66d63d14d26a0b380770df0bd389571ff3680e017e9,"Can you remember spotting an Audi in the following films?
Audi cars have been featured in many movies over the years. Did you spot one in these films?
Thought by many to be the most successful movie franchises ever to be created, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has different movies for everyone. There have been 21 films released already — the most recent being Captain Marvel — and at least a dozen more in the pipeline.
You don’t only enjoy the action in these films, but you may also be able to spot a stylish Audi, too.
When it comes to the Iron Man trilogy, at least one Audi has been featured in every film! A 2007 R8 and S5 B8 can be found in the first movie, a 2009 A8 LD3 and 2010 R8 Spyder are spotted in the sequel, and a 2012 S7 and R8 e-tron are both featured in Iron Man 3. The R8 e-tron also turned up at a VIP screening of Iron Man 3 at London’s Leicester Square a few days before the movie’s general release.
Another Audi fact is that there were almost as many Audi cars in the three Iron Man movies as there was in one Captain America film (Civil War). Within its two hours and 27 minutes runtime, you can see the 2017 Audi R8 V10 Plus, the 2017 SQ7, the 2017 A4, the 2016 A7 Sportback and even the Audi prologue concept car — a vehicle hailed as a “signature car” for Audi by Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Board Member for Development at Audi.
There’s more than meets the eye, though. Be on the lookout for an Audi R8, A6 Hybrid and A3 as you watch the excitement unfold in Avengers: Age of Ultron, as well as an Audi TTS Roadster, R8 Spyder, Q7 and A8 during Spider-Man Homecoming — the first standalone film by our favorite web-slinger since he became involved in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Taking a step back from the Marvel Universe, the German brand is also spotted in other film adaptations of comic book heroes. An R8 Spyder feature in Wolverine — the titular protagonist’s actor Hugh Jackman even turned up at the London Leicester Square premiere of the film in the same car — and an A8 plays a role in the 2015 big screen edition of Fantastic Four.
You also might’ve noticed the German manufacturer’s presence in all three film adaptations of E.L. James’ novels, which follow the relationship of business magnate Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.
What made this brand of car most attractive to the directors of this film? The brand’s multiple appearances came as a result of a partnership that was set up between Audi and Universal Pictures — a deal that Audi no doubt has relished seeing as the movie series has grossed over $1 billion across the globe!
In the first film of the trilogy, movie fans will be able to spot an Audi S8 D4, a 2017 S7 and an R8 Spyder. In the sequel, Fifty Shades Darker, a set of Audi Q7 cars and an A3 took center stage, with both the R8 and Q7 returning when the franchise wrapped up last year with Fifty Shades Freed.
To talk about Audi’s feature in Mission Impossible, let’s rewind back to the year 2000 and Mission: Impossible 2 to showcase how Audi has been featured in the hit movie series that has always starred Tom Cruise in the lead role of Ethan Hunt.
In a thrilling part of the film, Hunt leads a mission to destroy a deadly biological weapon and finds himself in an exhilarating car chase with international thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall. Hunt is behind the wheel of a Porsche Boxster and Nordoff-Hall tries to hold him off while driving an Audi TT — suffice to say that the pursuit between the two German-made cars into oncoming traffic is filled with nail-biting and edge-of-your-seat drama!
We couldn’t create an article about movies and cars without mentioning the Fast and Furious franchise. After all, this is a series that features street racing, heists, and espionage using all manners of vehicles, and has so far spanned eight main series entries and two additional short films — grossing in excess of $5 billion to date.
Fans are continually impressed with films that come out as part of this movie set. In fact, a spin-off movie called Hobbs & Shaw is due for release this summer.
Bringing a focus to Furious 7 now — a movie that clutched at the heartstrings as it was the final one to feature an appearance by series regular Paul Walker due to the actor being killed while the movie was still being filmed — is where you can see Audi appearing in the franchise.
You can spot the Audi R8 when it competes in an exciting quarter-mile race against a classic Plymouth Barracuda in the early moments of the film.
In the previously discussed films, the Audi’s that were featured are all models that exist. With I, ROBOT though, we’re taken to the future to see what Audi cars may potentially look like in years to come. Called the Audi RSQ, this concept vehicle represented the first time Audi had ever develop a car that was to be specifically used in a major Hollywood motion picture.
This futuristic model boasted piloted driving which allowed Will Smith’s Chicago police detective character Del Spooner to press a button to enable the car to take control of the driving — no doubt an early vision of the autonomous driving concept that we are only just starting to see being trialed in real life.
Those who take a ride in the RSQ are able to ride sideways and diagonal, while the use of balls instead of wheels was a quirky design touch. However, the typical single-frame grille and the presence of those four instantly recognizable silver rings let viewers clearly know that this car was without question an Audi.

Some of the most important ones include:

1. Technological advancements: The Vikings were skilled sailors and shipbuilders, and they developed new technologies that allowed them to travel further and faster than ever before. They also developed new weapons and armor that made them more effective in battle.

2. Economic motivations: The Vikings were motivated by economic gain, and they sought to acquire wealth and resources through raiding and conquest. They were also motivated by the desire to expand their territory and influence.

3. Political instability: The political instability in Europe during this period created opportunities for the Vikings to take advantage of weak or divided rulers. They were able to exploit these weaknesses to launch raids and conquests.

4. Religious beliefs: The Vikings were deeply religious and believed in the power of the gods. They saw raiding and conquest as a way to gain favor with the gods and to prove their bravery and strength.

5. Social and cultural factors: The Viking culture was one of adventure and exploration, and the Vikings were known for their love of travel and discovery. They were also known for their fierce independence and their willingness to take risks.

Overall, the combination of these factors created a perfect storm that led to the widespread Viking raids and invasions during this period."

d0587b9c2c209e36aad063fcab635045518eea1efcf100112083e21b05e27b3e,"Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How did Morley Safer describe his friendship with Molly Ivins and what did he miss about her?

Passage: Molly Ivins was the most popular liberal commentator of the last 25 years. Bill Minutaglio, author of a new biography of the tangy Texan, on why her voice is needed now more than ever.
There was Morley Safer, in a scrum of old hardball Texas liberals and graying hippies, and hanging out at his late friend Molly Ivins's favorite bar in Austin. With pitchers of Shiner everywhere, Safer was engulfed by dozens of folks wondering what the hell the woman who once had millions of faithful readers would say about health care, Afghanistan, and, yes, Rush Limbaugh’s attempt to own a piece of the Texas Blood Sport, otherwise known as professional football.
Safer, in town to donate his papers to the University of Texas, decided to drop by the book launch for my new biography of the ferociously mercurial and troubled Ivins.
Amid the weathered longhairs, musicians, underground cartoonists and civil liberties lawyers who once formed Austin's counterculture—the people Ivins called “freedom fighters”—Safer seemed merrily caught up in the nostalgia.
""She was one of the funniest and (most) thoughtful women I've ever met,"" Safer told a reporter from The Daily Texan. ""She was a great reporter, and we were good friends.""
Close to three years after her death, he's not alone in missing Ivins.
Nose around the Internet and you'll find plenty of other people still wishing she was writing—and wondering what Ivins, if she hadn't succumbed almost three years ago to cancer and a lifetime of wild personal rides, would have to say about the discourse in the twilight of 2009.
They miss the Texas cornpone flavored with a Tabasco sting, the unabashed defrocking she subjected the potentates to when they stole the stage. Maybe we need Molly—frequently described as “the only woman in the room”—more than ever before.
Her domineering father was the president of Tenneco and pals with men like Sen. John Tower, she grew up with George W. Bush, she was engaged to the son of a diplomat who did the CIA’s bidding. But after years of going to war with her controlling old man, devouring seditious issues of the muckraking Texas Observer, and furtively meeting the bravest Texas progressives, she eventually decided to raise a middle finger to all of her gilded upbringing.
It took a few years and some intense trip wires—the violent death of that fiance, her love affair with a ballsy activist, her knocking Bush's gun-toting political godfather to his knees one night in a Texas bar, her telling her bosses at The New York Times to shove it—but she finally found her calling as the most popular liberal political commentator in the last 25 years.
The fact that she did it in the Lone Star State, amid the misogynistic and Jack Daniels-fueled kingmakers, was rather startling to say the least. She fought sexual gropings by famous drunk politicos, three bouts of cancer, her own rampaging alcoholism—and plenty of death threats.
Through it all, Ivins kept the home fires burning for wandering progressives, liberal Israelites, who felt marginalized since the dawn of The Age of Reagan.
So, what would Molly Ivins say to those millions of readers today, including the ones beginning to think there has been some bait-and-switch at work with Obama?
Divorced from how you feel about her politics, most students of her work knew that she had perfected a magic act when it came to that public discourse; she talked about politics without the dour aura of either Emma Goldman or Charles Krauthammer. Nor did she scream with the raging acidity of Bill O’Reilly and Glenn Beck and their counterparts on the left. She chortled that Dubya was affable but a policy buffoon; she actually liked him personally, but hated his politics. And she spent years, and made a mint, working Bush over like his political career was one big speed bag. It was, as she sometimes told me and other folks in Austin, almost too easy.
Today, it might be a bit harder. She liked Obama and she thought he was far smarter than Bush. She’d maybe have to tap the piñata a bit more lightly in order to say what she wanted to say about Obama, about any sense of failed promises. But she would do it, and do it her way.
She would do it because she didn’t believe that a democracy was served very well by the vitriol, by the poison, by the hatred snaking through the discourse.
Bill Minutaglio is co-author, with W. Michael Smith, of Molly Ivins: A Rebel Life, released this week by PublicAffairs. He is a professor of journalism at The University of Texas at Austin and the author of several books, including George W. Bush & The Bush Family Dynasty and The President’s Counselor: The Rise to Power of Alberto Gonzales.","Morley Safer described his friendship with Molly Ivins as one where she was ""one of the funniest and (most) thoughtful women"" he had ever met. He also mentioned that they were good friends. Safer also expressed that he misses Ivins, as evidenced by his attendance at her book launch and his comments to a reporter from The Daily Texan."

Why did you have to leave?
Why does this have to hurt?
Cancer robbed thy life from thee..
But you went to heaven, and you went away.
That we'd die together in forevers sleep.
You didn't even say goodbye as you left me here.
I'm failing to choke down all these tears.
My face becomes moist, my sight turns to mist.
With my frown turned lips, i give you a kiss.
I try to look away as they lower your casket.
I'll try to survive, but I don't think i can las it.
I throw your favorite flowers into your grave.
Watching people throw dirt, over you they pave.
I feel no solace, I'm all alone.
As I see your name set in stone.
I feel a breeze, it's a wind so cold.
I remember the final words you had told..
You said to me, ""Don't take your life.""
I asked you, ""Why?"", as I put down the knife.
You told me you loved me, as its your final wish.
I shook my head yes, though I feel no bliss.
Why god took you away from me, but i will live on.
I hear your comforting whispers, I think its a sign.
So I know I'll see you agian when its my time.
The skeletal remains are being chalked out,while mystery and intrigue are engraven, cryptic.Lying beneath, this freshly seeded idea;upon these grounds, the words are etched,what are you looking for and how will you get it,for these are but the bare bones of a story.The key alone is in your closet, slowly turning,as you opened the creaking rusted door.You slowly peep inside the mausoleum of your mind,where cobwebs hang on every angle.Suddenly, a cold swift draft blows across your spine,as if someone has just, walked on your grave. You look up to see, all the entrapping’s laidbut then again, you are still lying in a good plot.
I’m going home to Jesus where He waits for me.
Spread your colored petals and cradle tender showers.
Ought we not to know the Tender of such lovely garden groves?
To cut away the stems of old for fuller future years.
Looking daily to their needs; so faithfully He waters.
When the Gardener comes to claim each one the earth held as its own.
He gently picks it at its peak and for His pleasure takes it home.
As God did one glorious morning, when the Perfect Rose had bloomed.
He rolled away the stone and met with Mary at the tomb.
There the sweetest Rose of Sharon rose that we die not alone.
But be gathered for a garden grove, surrounding heaven's throne.
I pray you will find.
and a peace of mind.
with God, you shall prevail.
you will never, never fail.

If you managed to generate very good ideas, conducted a thorough research, and organized your paper logically, but have made several grammar or spelling mistakes, your grade would be lowered. Revising and editing academic paper should be done several days prior to submission. Why? Because you need to leave your writing aside and then look at it with the fresh eye. Term paper editing is not about looking through your writing while listening to music, you need to be very attention and stay focused on numerous details.
First, take a look at your essay outline. Go through all points and try to change the order of ideas: make sure you have created a logical structure and ideas are presented either chronologically or thematically (from the least important to the most important). Locate thesis statement. Is it clear? Are there topic sentences in each paragraph? Are they related to the thesis statement? Are connections between the paragraphs clear or do you jump from one idea to another?
Essay body should contain enough supporting details contributing to thesis statement development. For example, if your topic is legalization of marijuana, you need to find at least three arguments supporting your point of view and provide rebuttal to the opposing views. Introduction and conclusion should not contain new information: introduction should provide general background information on the topic and inform the reader about your main idea, while conclusion should round up the whole essay.
Pay attention to each paragraph: it should include topic sentence and cover one point of discussion. Make sure you do not repeat the same idea twice in different parts of essay. Repeating is a sign of poor organization. Check the grammar - ask your parents or friends to assist you with essay editing . Pay attention to correct punctuation, avoid too short or too long sentences.
Revising is not the same as editing. Essay editing is about correcting mistakes, while essay revising is making major changes in your writing, adding ideas and deleting material. Revising should lead to overall paper improvement. Read your essay and if you do not like it, revise it. Ask yourself the following questions: what do I need to prove? What is the main idea? Is there enough supporting evidence? Are arguments clear and logical? Is my essay easy to understand? Have I cited all sources? Is introduction attention getting? Is conclusion logical?
Essay editing, proofreading, and revision is one of the services offered to high school and college students at Custom-Essay.ws. Even the smartest students make mistakes and need professional assistance with essay perfection. We employ experienced editors and proofreaders who are able to help you with paper improvement.

Editing is the process of correcting grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors in a written work. Revising, on the other hand, is the process of making major changes to the content and structure of a written work. Editing is usually done after the first draft of a paper has been completed, while revising is done before the final draft is written.

Analyze the potential of nuclear fusion as a viable and sustainable source of energy in the near future, taking into account factors such as efficiency, cost, and environmental impact. Additionally, explore any challenges and obstacles that need to be overcome in order to fully realize the potential of this technology. Finally, present your findings and recommendations on the feasibility of nuclear fusion as an alternative energy source.","Nuclear fusion is a process in which two light atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. This process is the same as the one that powers the sun and other stars. Nuclear fusion has been researched for decades as a potential source of clean and sustainable energy, but it has not yet been achieved on a commercial scale. However, recent advancements in fusion technology have brought us closer to realizing this potential.

Current State of Nuclear Fusion Technology

The current state of nuclear fusion technology is still in the experimental stage. There are several fusion reactors being developed around the world, but none of them have yet achieved the necessary conditions to sustain a fusion reaction. The most advanced of these reactors is the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), which is being built in France and is expected to be operational in the 2030s. ITER is a tokamak reactor, which uses a powerful magnetic field to confine the plasma and keep it at the necessary temperature and pressure for fusion to occur.

Other fusion reactors being developed include the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in the United States, which uses lasers to heat and compress a small amount of fuel, and the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator in Germany, which uses a complex magnetic field to confine the plasma.

Recent Research and Development Findings

Recent research and development findings have shown promising results for nuclear fusion. In 2020, researchers at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) achieved a milestone by producing more energy from a fusion reaction than was used to initiate it. This is a significant step towards achieving a self-sustaining fusion reaction, which is the ultimate goal of fusion research.

In addition, researchers at the University of California, San Diego, have developed a new method for creating and maintaining a stable plasma, which is a key component of fusion reactors. This method involves using a combination of magnetic fields and laser pulses to create a stable plasma that can be sustained for longer periods of time.

Potential of Nuclear Fusion as a Viable and Sustainable Source of Energy

Nuclear fusion has the potential to be a viable and sustainable source of energy in the near future. The main advantage of fusion is that it produces no greenhouse gases or other pollutants, making it a clean and sustainable source of energy. In addition, fusion fuel (deuterium and tritium) is abundant and can be extracted from seawater, making it a virtually inexhaust"

Venice was built on a group of islands in the lagoon of the Adriatic Sea, and its urban planning and architecture were shaped by this environment.

In terms of urban planning, Venice was designed as a series of canals and bridges, with the main streets running parallel to the canals. The city was divided into six districts, each with its own unique character and function. The city's architecture was characterized by its use of brick and stone, with a mix of Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque styles. The city's most famous landmarks, such as St. Mark's Basilica and the Doge's Palace, were built during the Renaissance period.

In comparison, other major European cities during the same historical period, such as Paris, London, and Rome, had different urban planning and architecture. Paris, for example, was built on a grid system, with wide avenues and grand boulevards. The city's architecture was characterized by its use of stone and iron, with a mix of Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque styles. The city's most famous landmarks, such as the Louvre and Notre-Dame Cathedral, were built during the Renaissance and Baroque periods.

London, on the other hand, was built on a series of hills and valleys, with a mix of medieval and modern architecture. The city's urban planning was characterized by its use of narrow streets and winding alleys, with a mix of Gothic, Tudor, and Georgian styles. The city's most famous landmarks, such as the Tower of London and Westminster Abbey, were built during the medieval and Tudor periods.

Rome, the capital of Italy, was built on a series of hills and valleys, with a mix of ancient and modern architecture. The city's urban planning was characterized by its use of wide streets and grand squares, with a mix of Roman, Renaissance, and Baroque styles. The city's most famous landmarks, such as the Colosseum and the Pantheon, were built during the Roman and Renaissance periods.

This is a very famous and liked by one and all. It is made with khoya, but now a days many instant mixes available in the market. With the instant mix, making it is very easy, but the taste differs from the one made with khoya. Once we taste the jamun made with khoya, we won't like to have them with the ready mix. I made them with khoya this time. All of us in my family liked very much. This I made as my kids' Birthday special. I have learned it from my neighbouring friend Geetha, who makes them only with khoya. Some people add rose water also. Khoya can be made at home or we can get it from stores also. But make sure that it should be fresh and a bit tighter and harder. Add a little all purpose flour to it and make jamuns. The shop keeper who sold khoya to me revealed the trick of the trade, that they add milk powder also to it, to make more softer and tastier jamuns. So we added that also in it. Combine water, sugar and cardamom, mix till the sugar dissolves. Bring it to boil. Boil it for 8 to 10 mins. Make a thin syrup. Sugar particles should not stick to the vessel, this will the syrup crystallizes, once it cooled. Add cardamom, I added the seeds directly, not the powder of it. Combine khoya, all purpose flour and milk powder together. Mix well and make soft dough out of it. Do not knead. Make small and equal sized balls. While making them press gently between palms and make round shaped balls. Heat oil in a deep and thick bottomed kadai. Do not over heat. Simmer the stove and slowly drop each ball into it. Cook them in a low to medium flame, stirring occasionally. If we cook them on high flame, they turn into brown outside and won't cook inside. Cook them till they turn brown in color. They should get nice golden brown color. Remove them from heat and slowly immerse them in sugar syrup. Let the sugar syrup be warm, even if it cooled, warm it for 2 minutes. Keep them in the syrup till we serve. Serve sweet and soft gulab jamuns cold or hot, either way is tasty. I like spongy sweets such as Rasgulla, Gulab gamun, and cham cham. The sugary juice with essence of makes the sweet even tastier. Can you suggest some variations to make gulab jamun more unique and flavorful?","Sure, here are some variations to make gulab jamun more unique and flavorful:

1. Rose Gulab Jamun: Add rose water to the khoya mixture and sugar syrup to give a rose flavor to the sweet.

2. Cardamom Gulab Jamun: Add ground cardamom to the khoya mixture and sugar syrup to give a cardamom flavor to the sweet.

3. Kesar Gulab Jamun: Add saffron to the khoya mixture and sugar syrup to give a kesar flavor to the sweet.

Here are some examples:

1. Symbolism: Symbolism is a literary device that uses symbols to represent abstract ideas or concepts. Authors use symbols to convey deeper meanings and themes in their stories. For example, a tree can symbolize growth, life, and change.

2. Foreshadowing: Foreshadowing is a technique that hints at events that will happen later in the story. Authors use foreshadowing to create suspense and to develop the plot. For example, a character might mention a storm coming, which could foreshadow a dangerous situation.

3. Irony: Irony is a literary device that involves a contrast between what is expected to happen and what actually happens. Authors use irony to create humor, to highlight the absurdity of a situation, or to make a point about a theme. For example, a character who is a hypocrite might say something that is ironic and contradictory to their beliefs.

4. Flashbacks: Flashbacks are a technique that allows the author to show events that happened in the past. Authors use flashbacks to provide context and to develop the plot. For example, a character might have a flashback to a traumatic event that shaped their personality.

5. Point of View: Point of view is the perspective from which the story is told. Authors use different points of view to develop the plot and to explore different themes. For example, a story told from the first-person point of view might focus on the internal thoughts and feelings of the narrator, while a story told from the third-person point of view might focus on the actions and motivations of multiple characters.

6. Metaphor: A metaphor is a figure of speech that compares two things that are not alike in order to make a point or to create a vivid image. Authors use metaphors to convey deeper meanings and to explore themes. For example, a character might be described as a ""wolf in sheep's clothing,"" which suggests that they are deceptive and dangerous.

7. Allusion: An allusion is a reference to a person, place, event, or work of art that is not explicitly mentioned in the text. Authors use allusions to create a sense of familiarity and to explore themes. For example, a character might make a reference to a famous work of literature, which could suggest that they are intelligent or well-read.

These are just a few examples"

Jason Nisbit, 39, is facing a charge of second degree homicide with intent in the death of 26-year-old Chelsea Martinez. A friend said Martinez’s husband found she'd been on a social networking site and had an exchange of disturbing messages with a man in Minnesota. Investigators tracked the profile to Nisbit. In the messages, Martinez said she can't wait to die but expresses fear over the idea. The two discuss how Nisbit will do it. Martinez said she will finally be at peace and thanks him. Martinez's car and body were found near a Minnesota park last week. Police say Nisbit admitted to killing her and took them to the body. Nisbit told police the two met at the park then walked a ways to a wooded area, saying he ""knew there was water available if he needed to wash anything off."" In the complaint, Nisbit said he tied Martinez's hands and feet with a cord then strangled her with another cord. After she passed out, he says he cut her throat with a knife. The complaint goes on to say he dragged her body to a culvert and partially covered her with dirt. Family and friends said the young mother of three battled depression and other mental issues her whole life and had been suicidal in the past. Minnesota authorities said Nisbit has no criminal record, only a few minor traffic offenses. He will be back in court August 24. Bond was set at $1 million.

End the story with a surprising plot twist that leaves readers with a haunting impression.","Lily had always been a fan of the annual harvest festival, but this year, she decided to take a different approach. Instead of just enjoying the food and games, she wanted to experience the haunted corn maze. She had heard stories about it from her friends, and she was eager to see for herself if it was as terrifying as they said.

As she entered the maze, she couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The corn stalks were tall and thick, and the air was thick with the scent of damp earth. The only sound was the rustling of the corn leaves and the occasional creak of the maze's wooden structure.

Lily tried to stay focused on the path in front of her, but her mind kept wandering to the stories she had heard. She imagined ghostly apparitions lurking in the shadows, waiting to grab her and drag her into the darkness.

Despite her fear, she continued to move forward, determined to find her way out. The maze seemed to stretch on forever, and she found herself lost in a maze of twists and turns. She tried to keep track of where she had been, but the corn stalks were too tall, and the path was too narrow.

As she walked, she began to hear strange noises. At first, she thought it was just the wind, but then she heard a faint whisper. She stopped and listened, but the whisper was gone. She continued on, but the whispers grew louder, and she could feel a presence behind her.

She turned around, but there was no one there. She tried to shake off the feeling of being watched, but it only grew stronger. She quickened her pace, but the whispers followed her, and the presence seemed to be closing in.

Suddenly, she heard a scream. She turned around and saw a figure in the distance, running towards her. She tried to call out, but her voice was drowned out by the sound of the corn leaves rustling.

The figure was getting closer, and Lily could see that it was a woman, dressed in a tattered dress. She had long, pale hair and a pale, gaunt face. Lily tried to run, but her feet were rooted to the ground. The woman was closing in, and Lily could feel her breath on her neck.

Just as the woman was about to grab her, Lily felt a sudden surge of energy. She pushed the woman away and ran as fast as she could. She didn't know"

When you want something sweet, it’s hard to resist the classic chocolate chip cookie. It’s sweet. It’s comforting. It’s loyal. It’s basically your BFF.
But, for those times you don’t want your BFF to be loaded with refined sugar, simple carbs, and unhealthy fats, you’re in luck because I gave your BFF a make-over! It’s pretty much the chocolate chip cookie of your dreams. These deep dish cookies are full of protein, low in fat, grain free, and low in sugar. No joke! A typical chocolate chip cookie has about 13 grams of sugar and 2 grams of protein. Howevah, these delicious treats have a whopping 8 grams of protein and a measly 2 grams of refined sugar!
And because I am with everything else in life, I am also indecisive about wanting a super chewy cookie or a really crispy one. So, if you needed another reason to love these deep dish cookies, you get the best of both worlds with them! They have a nice, crispy edge with a soft, chewy center. The trick to getting this combo is baking them in a muffin tin. Not only is it easy and convenient, but it also keeps the cookies from spreading out while baking, giving them the chewy center. And because the batter is touching the pan all the way around, you get a nice, crispy edge. It’s like the corner piece of a pan of brownies, but all around! Once again, it’s like unicorns invaded your dreams and made your wishes come true.
And whipping up these high protein treats couldn’t be any easier. As long as you’ve got a blender or food processor you’re in business, because we’re going to puree some chickpeas. Just trust me on this one. These little gems are going to give your cookies some texture, chewiness, and replaces the flour so the cookies are grain-free. Once you’ve got them pureed, all you need to do is mix the dry ingredients, stir together the wet ingredients, and then combine that all together.
Preheat the oven to 325 F. Grease a 12 cup muffin tin.
In a food processor or blender, puree the chickpeas with the water until smooth.
In a large bowl, add the coconut flour, protein powder, sweetener, baking powder and soda, and salt.
In a seperate bowl, combine the chickpea puree, egg, yogurt, milk, oil, and vanilla. Stir or whisk until fully combined.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until fully incorporated.
Evenly distribute the batter into the prepared muffin tins. It will be about 1.5 - 2 Tbsps of dough per cookie.
Smooth out the batter so batter touches the edges of the pan, but don't press/flatten the dough.
Bake for 14 min. or until the edges of the cookies turn golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cookie dough comes out clean.
Allow the cookies to cool completely in the pan.
Feel free to top with nut butter, jam, or more chocolate and eat 'em up!

Introduction: Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, and its impacts are being felt around the world. The Caribbean region is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including rising sea levels, increased frequency and intensity of storms, and changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. These changes have significant implications for the region's coastal ecosystems and communities, which are already under pressure from other stressors such as overfishing, pollution, and coastal development. This project aims to understand the impacts of climate change on coastal ecosystems and communities in the Caribbean, and to develop strategies for adaptation and resilience.

Objectives: The objectives of this project are:

1. To assess the current state of coastal ecosystems and communities in the Caribbean, including their vulnerability to climate change and their adaptive capacity.

2. To identify the key drivers of change in coastal ecosystems and communities, and to understand how these drivers interact with climate change.

3. To develop a framework for assessing the impacts of climate change on coastal ecosystems and communities, and to apply this framework to specific case studies in the Caribbean.

4. To develop strategies for adaptation and resilience, and to test these strategies in pilot projects in the Caribbean.

Methods: The project will use a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, including remote sensing, field surveys, and interviews with local stakeholders. The project will also involve collaboration with local communities, NGOs, and government agencies to ensure that the research is relevant and useful for decision-making.

Expected Outcomes: The project is expected to produce a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of climate change on coastal ecosystems and communities in the Caribbean, and to develop practical strategies for adaptation and resilience.

Step 1: Turn off the water supply
Before you start, make sure to turn off the water supply to the shower. You can do this by turning off the main water valve or the valve under the sink. This will prevent any water from flowing through the pipes and onto the floor.

Step 2: Remove the old showerhead
Using a wrench or pliers, remove the old showerhead from the pipe. You may need to wiggle it a bit to loosen it. Once it's loose, you can remove it from the pipe.

Step 3: Clean the pipe
Before installing the new showerhead, clean the pipe where the old showerhead was removed. Use a cloth or a brush to remove any debris or mineral buildup.

Step 4: Install the new showerhead
Attach the new showerhead to the pipe by hand, then use a wrench or pliers to tighten it. Make sure it's tight enough to prevent any leaks.

Step 5: Turn on the water supply
Once the new showerhead is installed, turn the water supply back on. Check for any leaks by turning on the shower and checking the pipe and the showerhead for any signs of water leakage.

Step 6: Test the new showerhead
Once you've confirmed that there are no leaks, test the new showerhead to make sure it's working properly. Check the water pressure and adjust the flow as needed.

Step 7: Enjoy your new showerhead
Congratulations! You've successfully installed a new showerhead. Enjoy your new showerhead and the improved water pressure and flow.

Note: If you're not comfortable with DIY projects or if you encounter any issues during the installation process, it's best to call a professional plumber for assistance."

During his reign, he encouraged the adoption of Western-style clothing and introduced modern education and technology, which led to the decline of traditional Thai clothing.

The king himself wore Western-style clothing, which set a trend for the royal family and the nobility. This led to a gradual shift in the fashion industry, with more people adopting Western-style clothing. However, traditional Thai clothing was still worn by the general population, especially during religious and cultural events.

The introduction of modern education and technology also led to the development of new fabrics and techniques, which were used to create new styles of clothing. This led to the emergence of a new fashion industry, which catered to the growing demand for Western-style clothing.

Overall, King Chulalongkorn's policies towards Westernization had a mixed impact on the traditional Thai clothing and fashion industry. While it led to the decline of traditional clothing, it also paved the way for the development of a new fashion industry that catered to the changing tastes of the people."

Make sure to include tips for achieving a caramelized crust on the steak without overcooking the inside. Use clear, concise language and provide visuals if possible to make the instructions easy to follow.","Cooking a perfectly seared steak is a simple process that can be done in a few easy steps. Here are the instructions:

Ingredients:
- 1-2 steaks (depending on the size of the steaks and how many people you are serving)
- Salt and pepper
- 2 tablespoons of oil (olive oil or vegetable oil)
- Optional: garlic, rosemary, or other herbs for added flavor

Instructions:

1. Choose the right steak: The best steaks for searing are those that are thick and have a good amount of fat. Popular choices include ribeye, New York strip, and filet mignon. Make sure the steaks are at room temperature before you start cooking.

2. Season the steak: Season the steaks with salt and pepper on both sides. If you want to add more flavor, you can also add minced garlic or chopped rosemary to the seasoning.

3. Heat the pan: Heat a large skillet or cast-iron pan over high heat. Add the oil and let it heat up for a few minutes.

4. Sear the steak: Place the steak in the pan and let it sear for 2-3 minutes on each side. You want to achieve a nice, caramelized crust on the steak. If you want to add more flavor, you can add the garlic or rosemary to the pan during the searing process.

5. Check the temperature: Use a meat thermometer to check the temperature of the steak. The internal temperature should be 135°F for medium-rare, 145°F for medium, and 155°F for well-done. If the steak is not at the desired temperature, continue cooking for a few more minutes.

6. Rest the steak: Once the steak is cooked to your liking, remove it from the pan and let it rest for 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the steak, making it more tender and flavorful.

7. Serve: Slice the steak against the grain and serve with your favorite sides. You can also drizzle with a little bit of olive oil or balsamic vinegar for added flavor.

Tips:
- Make sure the pan is hot before you start searing the steak. A hot pan will help achieve a nice, caramelized crust on the steak.
- Don't overcrowd the pan. If you have more than one steak, cook them in batches to ensure they get a good se"

Sixth-year medical student, Satyen Hargovan’s honours research project has generated a check-list of the top 10 factors that influence the survival of sepsis patients.
Sepsis is a common medical condition, where chemicals released by the immune system to fight an infection trigger the inflammation and eventual shut-down of multiple organs.
Some 15,700 patients with sepsis are admitted to Australian Intensive Care Units every year. About one in five die. The cost of treating each case is more than $39,000.
“The burden of sepsis is not only in relation to patient outcomes, but also the financial cost to the healthcare system,” Mr Hargovan said.
His project, known as the Cairns Sepsis Model – 4 (CSM- 4) is designed to speed up the assessment of patients within their first four hours in ICU.
The new four-hour mortality prediction model will enable clinicians to detect patients who are at a higher risk of dying, then help to guide their treatment decisions and discussions with the patient and their family.
“Essentially it means that if a patient has a five percent chance of dying, you might treat them less invasively,” he said. “For example, you won’t rush to place them in an induced coma, or insert lines into large arteries or veins.
Mr Hargovan began his research by reviewing more than 50 mortality prediction studies, but soon realized that there was no model in the world specifically designed to predict mortality in adult sepsis patients within four hours of ICU admission.
A case history review of 500 adult sepsis patients admitted to the Cairns Hospital ICU over a four-year period identified 168 factors that could influence patient health outcomes, ranging from age, gender and socio-economic status to type of infection, degree of organ failure, vital signs, blood test results and treatment regimes.
Statistical analysis whittled the figure down to the 10 most significant factors, which include age, history of renal disease, level of consciousness, and abnormal levels of certain substances in the blood that represent varying degrees of organ dysfunction.
The mortality prediction model is inexpensive to use as it largely relies on information easily gleaned from patient history, physical examination, and blood tests that are routinely conducted on patients within their first four hours of admission to an ICU.
The next step involves testing his model on a different and larger set of patients in order to validate his research, before it can be accepted for clinical use.
“Then we’d love to create an online calculator or an app that clinicians can use easily, at the bedside, and have a result within seconds,” he said.

1. Speeding up the assessment of patients within their first four hours in ICU, which can help clinicians to detect patients who are at a higher risk of dying and guide their treatment decisions and discussions with the patient and their family.

Incorporate at least three sensory details (sight, smell, sound, touch, taste) to enhance your descriptions. Use your imagination and make your entry vivid for the reader.","Dear Diary,

Today was a day of adventure and discovery. I woke up in the morning, feeling the warmth of the sun on my fur. I stretched and yawned, then began to explore the world around me. The first thing I noticed was the smell of fresh food in the kitchen. My nose twitched as I inhaled the aroma of the delicious food. I could hear the sound of my owner's footsteps as they walked into the room. I watched as they prepared my breakfast, and I could feel the warmth of the sun on my fur as I lay in the sunbeam.

After breakfast, I decided to explore the backyard. I could hear the sound of birds chirping and the rustling of leaves in the wind. I could smell the fresh grass and the scent of flowers. I could feel the soft grass beneath my paws as I walked. I saw a butterfly fluttering around a flower, and I watched as it landed on a nearby leaf. I could taste the dew on the grass as I licked my paws.

As the day went on, I continued to explore the world around me. I could hear the sound of my owner's voice as they talked on the phone. I could smell the scent of the laundry detergent as they did the laundry. I could feel the cool breeze on my fur as I lay in the shade. I saw a squirrel scampering up a tree, and I watched as it gathered nuts and seeds.

As the day came to a close, I curled up in a warm, cozy spot and fell asleep. I dreamed of adventures and new discoveries. I know that tomorrow will bring new experiences and new sights to explore. I am grateful for the world around me and the adventures that await me.

Yours truly,
A curious cat"

I am making it weekly because they love it so much. The recipe is fabulous, but needed some tweaks. I doubled the recipe and added 2 eggs, used organic brown rice flour in place of wheat, and substituted 1/2 tsp garlic powder and hot water for the chicken broth. The cookies keep well in the fridge. I made these for my Yorkie/Rat Terrier mix and when they came out of the oven his tail was wagging just from the smell. He LOVES them. What can I substitute for the cheese in this dog treat recipe? I don't feed my dog cheese (let's be honest--it's basically junk food that doesn't belong in an adult dog's diet). Is there anything that you recommend substituting the cheese with? Or can I just leave it out? You could substitute the cheese for an 1/8 cup of ground flax or wheat bran. Is there something else I could use besides oats and wheat flour for this recipe? Chef's Comments ~ That's a great question. You can easily substitute the flour in this and most of our dog treat recipes. A few good grain free flours include almond flour, chickpea flour, potato flour and soy flour. Most of those flours should be available at a major grocery store. As far as substituting the oats, that's a little trickier, but it can be done. The oats are in the recipe for texture and soaking up moisture, so that's what you'll need to replace. First, you will want to halve the amount of oats and add an extra 1/2 cup of flour (or a mixture of the previously mentioned flours). Then you can add a 1/2 cup combination of unsweetened coconut, chopped peanuts and crumbled almond crackers. Or, you could replace all of the oats with the flour mixture. Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? If so, does it still need to be microwaved? Chef's Answer ~ That's a great question! :) I haven't tried this recipe with fresh spinach, but I don't see why it couldn't work. If you minced the spinach very fine, my guess is that you would not need to microwave, or otherwise cook, the spinach before adding it to the dog treat dough. Comments for Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? Is it necessary to store these cookies in a Refrigerator? Since these are cookies, can it be kept in air tight container outside? And how long would it last if this is done? Chef's Comments ~ You can get lots of tips on How to Store Dog Treats on my website. Unless you live in a very cold climate, most dog treats need to be kept indoors, and even better in the refrigerator. My dogs is algeric to grain. What can I use instead of the whole whear flour? My Husky can't have grain. What can I use besides whole wheat flour. You should put more recipes with no grain in them. Chef's Answer ~ You can replace the wheat flour in most of my dog treat recipes with a non-grain flour. For example, any type of bean flour like Chick Pea (Garbanzo Bean) flour, or ""flours"" from nuts. They are technically nut meals, but they work as flour, for example almond meal. You should be able to find grain free flours at specialty grocery stores, or at health food stores. Very good simple recipe, however wheat flour isn't something I would normally have in my cupboard. Would it be ok to use plain flour or self raising? Chef's Answer ~ Yes, you can use all purpose flour in place of the whole wheat flour. I do not recommend using self-rising flour because it has the addition of baking powder or baking soda added to it. These are things that homemade dog treats do not need. Can fresh/raw spinach be used in place of frozen spinach in a particular dog treat recipe, and does it need to be cooked beforehand?","Yes, fresh or raw spinach can be used in place of frozen spinach in a dog treat recipe. However, it is important to note that fresh spinach should be thoroughly washed and chopped into small pieces before adding it to the recipe. Additionally, fresh spinach may need to be cooked or blanched before adding it to the recipe, as it can be quite tough and difficult for dogs to chew and digest when raw."

Generate according to: Onur Unal is Senior Art Director at Propaganda Advertising Agency in Istanbul.
It all started back in my childhood, I always interested in drawing doodles, reading comics and creating characters. I was inspired by humour magazines, and I was dreaming of become a caricature artist. I took courses on drawing technics, and after graduating from high school, I studied Graphic Design at Marmara University Fine Arts Faculty in Istanbul, Turkey.
During school, I got interested in advertising, and started an internship at Mullen Lowe Istanbul and TBWA Istanbul to practice on creative thinking and art direction. After that, I started to work for Big34, and a year after I accepted for Manajans/JWT. It was the most important years of my career.
I worked on important advertising campaigns of global clients, and won national and international advertising awards as Crystal Apple, Cannes Lions. I’m currently working for Propaganda Advertising Agency, and continue to design creative ideas for our clients.
I work for advertising agencies as an art director since 2009. I work for global and local clients as Nokia, Elidor/Sunsilk, Bosch, Shell, Turkcell, Mazda, Kia, Turkish Airlines, Hyundai, Nestle, Beko, Michelin, BMW, Red Bull, Mitsubishi Electric, Bayer, etc. I work mostly full-time at the office, and these days I also design mobile games with a freelance team.
I learnt that I should keep learning. As the technology and the design trends develop day by day, designers should stay updated. Last year I attended a design week about UX and digital design in London to learn more about digital design principles. During the week, I attended workshops at the design offices, and met designers from all over the world. It was a great experience to compare myself, and now I have new targets for my career.
I always try to find an exciting idea to get inspired. It can be anything – an interesting visual, a strong speech, a good music, anything. To find it, I make a quick research, take some notes and draw sketches. After, I brainstorm with our creative team and we share our ideas. Then the design process starts, I put on my headphones and focus on the design. After designing many alternatives, we make a discussion with our creative team and choose the best one.
The main materials I use are a blank sheet, a pen and creative thinking. All other tools and computer programs help to complete the final process.
Currently I work for Propaganda Advertising Agency. We have a beautiful office at the center of Istanbul with a nice view. I usually go to work around 9:30 am, have my breakfast while reading the news and after that the work begins. I work with a copywriter, and our team lead by a creative director. We usually make meetings at the beginning of the week with our brand executives, and we make a schedule for the deadlines. I usually work until 6:00 – 7:00 pm during the week, but under curtain some circumstances, we work overtimes and also weekends.
As my carreer began, I mostly worked on advertising campaigns, print materials, 360 ideas and digital advertising. Recently, I have been interested in UI, UX and digital design, and want to combine my creative background on advertising with the innovative projects.
During my short study in London last year, I had the chance to work and share my ideas with the designers all over the world, and I discovered things that I had never seen before.
I always believe that a designer should be in contact with all other designers and I want to cross the borders and surround myself with creative people around the world in my own studio.
