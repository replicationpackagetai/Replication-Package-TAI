1. Energy Efficiency: Implementing energy-efficient appliances, insulation, and building materials can significantly reduce energy consumption. Solar panels and wind turbines can also be used to generate renewable energy.

2. Water Conservation: Rainwater harvesting systems can be used to collect and store rainwater for later use. Low-flow fixtures and drought-resistant landscaping can also help conserve water.

3. Green Spaces: Incorporating green spaces, such as parks, gardens, and trees, can help reduce heat island effect, improve air quality, and provide habitats for wildlife.

4. Public Transportation: Designing housing developments near public transportation hubs can encourage residents to use public transportation instead of private vehicles, reducing carbon emissions.

5. Waste Management: Implementing recycling programs, composting, and reducing packaging can help reduce waste.

6. Sustainable Materials: Using sustainable materials, such as reclaimed wood, recycled steel, and bamboo, can help reduce the environmental impact of construction.

7. Smart Home Technology: Smart home technology can help monitor and control energy usage, reducing overall consumption.

8. Community Engagement: Encouraging community engagement and education about sustainable practices can help foster a culture of sustainability.

9. Urban Planning: Urban planning should prioritize walkability, bikeability, and the creation of mixed-use neighborhoods to reduce the need for car travel.

10. Green Building Certification: Achieving green building certification, such as LEED or BREEAM, can help ensure that the development meets certain sustainability standards.

By incorporating these strategies, housing developments can be designed to be more sustainable, reducing their environmental impact and promoting a healthier, more livable community."

Here's a list of plants that are effective at removing common indoor air pollutants:

1. Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)
2. Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)
3. Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)
4. Bamboo Palm (Chamaedorea seifrizii)
5. Golden Pothos (Epipremnum aureum)
6. English Ivy (Hedera helix)
7. Gerbera Daisy (Gerbera jamesonii)
8. Chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium)
9. Boston Fern (Nephrolepis exaltata)
10. Philodendron (Philodendron scandens oxycardium)

The number of plants you need depends on the size of your office. A general rule of thumb is to have at least one plant per 100 square feet of space. However, it's essential to keep in mind that plants can only help to improve air quality, and they are not a substitute for proper ventilation and air filtration systems.

In addition to plants, consider using air-filtering materials such as activated carbon, zeolite, or potassium permanganate to further improve air quality in your closet office."

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]
Student:","To solve this instance, we need to find the product of odd numbers in each inner list and return a list of the results. Here's the solution:

1. Identify the inner lists in the given list: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]

2. Iterate through each inner list and find the odd numbers:

   - For the first inner list: [40, -36, 45, -47], the odd numbers are 45 and -47.
   - For the second inner list: [-7, 39, 4, 23], the odd numbers are 39 and 23.
   - For the third inner list: [-26, -3, 32, 1], the odd numbers are 32 and 1.
   - For the fourth inner list: [-3, 20, -14, -38], the odd numbers are 20 and -38.
   - For the fifth inner list: [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], the odd numbers are -26 and -49.
   - For the sixth inner list: [-19, 28, -39], the odd numbers are 28 and -39.
   - For the seventh inner list: [43, 8], the odd numbers are 43.
   - For the eighth inner list: [-44, -16, 29], the odd numbers are 29"

20. What's is the sum of the squares of all factors of 210?","To solve this problem, we first need to find all the factors of 210. Since 210 is a composite number, it has more than two factors.

1. Prime factors: We can find the prime factors of 210 using trial division or other methods. The prime factors of 210 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.

2. Factor pairs: Now that we have the prime factors, we can find all the factor pairs by multiplying each pair of prime factors.

   - (2 * 3) * (5 * 7) = 60
   - (2 * 5) * (3 * 7) = 105
   - (2 * 7) * (3 * 5) = 105

3. Sum of squares: Now that we have all the factors, we can find the sum of the squares of all factors.

   - Sum of squares of factors = (2^2) + (3^2) + (5^2) + (7^2) + (60^2) + (105^2) + (105^2)

4. Calculate the sum: Finally, we can calculate the sum of the squares of all factors.

   - Sum of squares of factors = 4 + 9 + 25 + 49 + 3600 + 11025 + 11025

5. Simplify the expression: Simplify the expression to get the final answer.

   - Sum of squares of factors = 11130

The sum of the squares of all factors of 210 is 11130."

In Luau, you can access the parent of an object using the `Parent` property. However, there is no direct way to access the parent's name using the syntax you provided (`v.ParentName`).

To get the name of the parent, you can use the `Name` property of the `Instance` object. Here's an example:

```lua
local myObject = game.Workspace:FindFirstChild(""MyObject"")
local parent = myObject.Parent
local parentName = parent.Name
print(parentName)
```

In this example, `myObject` is the object you're interested in, and `MyObject` is the name of the object. The script finds the object, gets its parent, and then gets the name of the parent. The `print` function is used to output the name of the parent to the console.

Remember to replace `""MyObject""` with the actual name of the object you're interested in. Also, make sure that the object exists in the game before running the script.

If you're trying to access a property of a parent object, you can do so by using the dot notation. For example:

```lua
local myObject = game.Workspace:FindFirstChild(""MyObject"")
local parent = myObject.Parent
local parentProperty = parent.SomeProperty
print(parentProperty)
```

In this example, `SomeProperty` is a property of the parent object. You can replace it with any valid property name."

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over April, May, and June, making it the worst-affected major industrial nation in the first half of 2020."

You can do this by using a backslash (`\`) before the `=` symbol. For example:

```python
import re

text = ""a=b""
pattern = r""a=\b""

match = re.search(pattern, text)
if match:
    print(""Match found!"")
else:
    print(""No match found."")
```

In this example, the `\b` is a word boundary, which ensures that the `=` symbol is matched as a literal and not as a special character. If you don't need to use word boundaries, you can simply escape the `=` symbol like this:

```python
import re

text = ""a=b""
pattern = r""a=b""

match = re.search(pattern, text)
if match:
    print(""Match found!"")
else:
    print(""No match found."")
```

In this case, the `=` symbol is escaped with a backslash, so it is treated as a literal."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that it's hard to believe that Donald Trump has been president for a year already. He found it unfair that many people claim Trump hasn't achieved anything. In contrast, Kimmel highlighted that Trump has broken a presidential record by playing golf over 70 times in a year. Kimmel then encouraged people to do something positive, such as enrolling in the Affordable Care Act's open-enrollment period, which is currently happening. Despite Trump's administration's efforts to undermine the plan, Kimmel noted that sign-ups have surged. Kimmel emphasized that he has been critical of Trump's healthcare policies, but he encouraged viewers to consider the new healthcare plan, which covers pre-existing conditions, has no lifetime caps, and is surprisingly affordable for people earning under $50,000. Kimmel directed viewers to Healthcare.gov to sign up. In essence, Kimmel's critique of Trump's accomplishments is that he has played golf more than any other president, while Kimmel encourages people to take positive action, such as enrolling in the Affordable Care Act."

However, if we are to single out one episode that best encapsulates these themes, it would be ""Episode 4: The Dance.""

This episode is significant because it delves deeper into the dynamics of the three main characters, Ai, Kana, and Ririka, and their friendship. The episode revolves around the trio's participation in a dance competition, which tests their bond and individual strengths.

The episode highlights the theme of female friendship by demonstrating the challenges the girls face when they compete against each other. Despite their rivalry, they ultimately realize the importance of their friendship and work together to achieve their common goal.

Moreover, the episode showcases the theme of empowerment by portraying the girls' journey towards self-discovery and self-improvement. Each character has her own unique strengths and weaknesses, and the episode emphasizes the importance of embracing one's individuality while also working together as a team.

Overall, ""Episode 4: The Dance"" is a powerful representation of the themes of female friendship and empowerment in ""Girlfriends Ahead."" It demonstrates the importance of friendship, teamwork, and self-discovery in overcoming challenges and achieving success."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

In the heart of a quaint, picturesque town, nestled between the rolling hills and the whispering winds, lies a hidden gem that has captured the hearts of many - the Enchanted Forest of Whispering Willows. This magical sanctuary, a testament to nature's splendor, is a place where time seems to stand still, and the soul finds solace in its embrace.

As one steps into the forest, the air is filled with a symphony of sounds - the rustling leaves, the chirping birds, and the gentle murmur of the babbling brook that winds its way through the heart of the forest. The sunlight filters through the dense canopy, casting dappled shadows on the moss-covered ground, creating an ethereal atmosphere that is both calming and invigorating.

The towering willows, their branches adorned with delicate, lace-like leaves, sway gently in the breeze, whispering secrets to those who dare to listen. Their roots, twisted and gnarled, form a natural labyrinth, inviting exploration and discovery. The forest floor is carpeted with vibrant wildflowers, their colors a riot of reds, yellows, and purples, adding a splash of vibrancy to the otherwise muted tones of the forest.

The Enchanted Forest is a place where the worries of the world seem to melt away, replaced by a sense of peace and tranquility. It is a place where one can lose oneself in the beauty of nature, finding solace in the embrace of the trees and the gentle murmur of the brook.

1. Overview

This design outlines a conceptual approach for secure and efficient data exchange between two companies using Azure Storage Queues. The solution leverages Azure's reliable, scalable, and secure messaging service to facilitate data transfer.

2. Key Components

   - Azure Storage Accounts: Both companies will have their own Azure Storage Accounts to store and manage data.
   - Azure Storage Queues: These are message-oriented queues that store messages as they travel between applications or services.
   - Azure Service Bus Namespace: This is a cloud-based messaging service that enables reliable communication between applications and services.
   - Azure Functions: Serverless compute service that can be used to process messages from the queues.
   - Azure Logic Apps: A cloud service that helps automate workflows and integrations across multiple services and systems.

3. High-Level Architecture

   - Company A will create a message containing the data to be sent and send it to a shared Azure Storage Queue.
   - Azure Service Bus Namespace will be used to ensure reliable delivery of messages.
   - Azure Functions will be used to process messages from the queue and perform any necessary transformations or validations.
   - Azure Logic Apps will be used to trigger the Azure Functions and manage the overall workflow.
   - Company B will have a similar setup to receive messages from the shared queue.

4. Security Considerations

   - Access to the shared Azure Storage Queue will be controlled using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
   - All communication between the companies will be encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
   - Azure Monitor and Azure Security Center will be used to monitor and secure the solution.

5. Scalability and Performance

   - Azure Storage Queues can handle millions of messages per second, ensuring high performance and scalability.
   - Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps can be easily scaled up or down based on the volume of messages.

6. Monitoring and Maintenance

   - Azure Monitor will be used to monitor the performance and health of the solution.
   - Azure Log Analytics"

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

Can you provide a comprehensive set of HTML data points that illustrate the different ways sleep deprivation impacts human physiology? Additionally, please include a comparative analysis of the consequences of acute versus chronic sleep deprivation on overall wellness.","I'm glad you're interested in the effects of sleep deprivation on human health. While I can't provide HTML data points directly, I can certainly help you understand the topic and suggest a way to represent the information in an HTML format.

Sleep deprivation has significant long-term implications on both physical and mental health. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Mental Health**: Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to mood disorders such as depression and anxiety, cognitive impairment, and decreased productivity. It can also affect emotional regulation, leading to increased stress and irritability.

2. **Physical Health**: Lack of sleep can weaken the immune system, making you more susceptible to infections. It can also contribute to weight gain, high blood pressure, and an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes.

3. **Cognitive Function**: Sleep deprivation can impair memory, learning, and decision-making abilities. It can also lead to microsleeps, which are brief moments of sleep that occur when you're awake, potentially causing accidents or mistakes.

4. **Aging**: Chronic sleep deprivation can accelerate the aging process, leading to wrinkles, dark circles, and a dull complexion. It can also contribute to the development of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

Now, let's compare the consequences of acute versus chronic sleep deprivation:

- **Acute Sleep Deprivation**: This refers to a short-term lack of sleep, such as pulling an all-nighter. The effects are usually temporary and include fatigue, irritability, and decreased cognitive function.

- **Chronic Sleep Deprivation**: This refers to a long-term lack of sleep, such as consistently getting less than 7 hours of sleep per night. The effects are more severe and can lead to the health issues mentioned above.

To represent this information in an HTML format, you could create a table with the following columns:

- **Topic**: Mental Health, Physical Health, Cognitive Function, Aging
- **Effect of Acute Sleep Deprivation**: Brief overview of the effect
- **Effect of Chronic Sleep Deprivation**: Brief overview of the effect

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To achieve this in JavaScript, you can use Base64 encoding and decoding. Here's a simple example:

1. Encoding the string:

```javascript
function encodeBase64(str) {
    return btoa(str);
}

// Usage
let longString = ""Your long string here"";
let encodedString = encodeBase64(longString);
console.log(encodedString);
```

2. Decoding the string:

```javascript
function decodeBase64(str) {
    return atob(str);
}

// Usage
let encodedString = ""Your encoded string here"";
let decodedString = decodeBase64(encodedString);
console.log(decodedString);
```

This way, you can encode your long string into a shorter one, share it via a URL, and then decode it back to its original form. Keep in mind that Base64 encoding adds approximately 33% to the original size of the data.

You can use this online tool to encode and decode strings: https://www.base64-encoder.org/

Also, remember that Base64 encoding is not secure, so it's not suitable for sensitive data. If you need to share sensitive data, consider using other methods like encryption."

Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node, we can use a heuristic search algorithm such as A* search. A* search combines the cost of moving from the start node to the current node (g-score) with an estimate of the cost from the current node to the goal node (h-score).

In this case, the heuristic function (h-score) can be defined as the Manhattan distance between the current node and the goal node. The Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the current node and the goal node.

Let's calculate the h-score for each node in the grid world:

* (1,1): h = |3-1| + |3-3| = 4
* (2,1): h = |3-2| + |3-3| = 3
* (3,1): h = |3-3| + |3-3| = 0
* (1,2): h = |3-1| + |3-2| = 5
* (2,2): h = |3-2| + |3-2| = 2
* (3,2): h = |3-3| + |3-2| = 1
* (1,3): h = |3-1| + |3-3| = 4
* (2,3): h = |3-2| + |3-3| = 3
* (3,3): h = |3-3| + |3-3| = 0

Now, let's calculate the g-score for each node by starting from the start node (PacMan's location) and moving to the adjacent nodes:

* (1,1): g = 0 (start node)
* (2,1): g = 1 (move from (1,1) to (2,1))
* (3,1): g = 2 (move from (2,1) to (3,1))

(We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.

Here's a simplified explanation of how EASA evaluates each supplier a PO works with:

1. **Supplier Identification**: POs identify potential suppliers based on their product requirements.

2. **Initial Evaluation**: POs conduct an initial evaluation of the supplier's capabilities, quality management system, and compliance with relevant regulations. This evaluation may involve reviewing the supplier's documentation, visiting their facilities, and discussing their processes.

3. **Approval Criteria**: EASA has established approval criteria that POs must consider when evaluating suppliers. These criteria include the supplier's ability to meet the PO's quality and delivery requirements, their technical competence, and their compliance with relevant regulations.

4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Once a supplier is approved, the PO continues to monitor their performance. This monitoring may involve regular audits, reviews of the supplier's documentation, and discussions about any issues that arise.

5. **Re-evaluation**: POs periodically re-evaluate their suppliers to ensure they continue to meet the approval criteria. This re-evaluation may be triggered by changes in the supplier's capabilities, quality management system, or compliance with regulations.

6. **Corrective Actions**: If a supplier fails to meet the approval criteria, the PO may take corrective actions, such as requiring the supplier to make improvements or terminating the supplier relationship.

7. **Documentation**: POs maintain documentation of their supplier approval process, including the evaluation criteria, the results of their evaluations, and any corrective actions taken. This documentation is important for demonstrating compliance with EASA regulations.

In summary, EASA requires POs to have a rigorous supplier approval process to ensure the quality and safety of the products they use. This process involves initial evaluation, continuous monitoring, re-evaluation, corrective actions, and documentation."

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","Congham Hall Hotel stands out from other hotels in the area due to its unique ambiance and exceptional dining options. The hotel is nestled in a hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, offering a peaceful retreat away from the hustle and bustle of the outside world. The hotel's Georgian mansion, with its sash windows that overlook a scene little changed since the Everards moved in two centuries ago, exudes a charm and tradition that is hard to find elsewhere.

The hotel's dining options are another highlight. The 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O'Connor, offers a delightful twist on fish, meat, and vegetarian dishes, with most ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of the area. The atmosphere in the dining room is relaxed and inviting, making it the perfect place to unwind after a long day.

The hotel's staff are friendly and welcoming, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere that makes guests feel at home. The hotel's grounds are beautifully maintained, with plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit, and herb gardens encouraged. The hotel also offers a sumptuous Secret Garden Spa, with a swimming pool, hot tub, and a range of treatments and therapies.

In summary, Congham Hall Hotel offers a unique and unforgettable experience for guests seeking a peaceful retreat in a charming and traditional setting. The hotel's exceptional dining options, warm and welcoming staff, and beautiful grounds make it a must-visit destination for anyone traveling to the area."

I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","To create an empty REST API using FastAPI and Pydantic for DTO, I'll provide you with the basic structure for managing groups of users. I'll separate read DTO from write DTO as requested.

First, install the required packages:

```
pip install fastapi pydantic uvicorn

Now, let's create the main FastAPI application file (main.py):

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

app = FastAPI()

class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: str
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: str

class GroupWriteDTO(BaseModel):

    pass

@app.post(""/groups"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
async def create_group(group: GroupWriteDTO):
    # Your code to create a group in the database
    pass
```

This code sets up the FastAPI application and defines the GroupReadDTO and GroupWriteDTO classes for the read and write DTOs, respectively. The `get_groups` and `create_group` functions are the empty views for reading and writing groups, respectively.

You can now extend these functions to interact with your database and implement the desired functionality."

They are found in various regions, including Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and South America.

Flight patterns can be influenced by factors such as geographical location, climate, and habitat. However, specific differences in flight patterns between Tabanus species in different regions have not been extensively studied.

Research on Tabanus species in Africa has shown that they are attracted to moving objects, such as animals and humans, and are known to bite and feed on their blood. In North America, some Tabanus species are known to be more aggressive than others, with some species being more likely to bite humans.

In terms of flight patterns, Tabanus species are known to be strong fliers, with some species capable of flying at high speeds and covering long distances. They are also known to be attracted to light sources, such as streetlights and porch lights, and are often seen flying around these areas.

Overall, while there may be some differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus species in different regions, more research is needed to fully understand these differences and their underlying causes."

 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game.

 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.

Student:","Passage 3 contains the information about Joanna I of Naples and her father-in-law, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Therefore, it can be used to answer the question about how many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law. The answer is 1, as Charles I of Hungary is the only king mentioned in the passage."
