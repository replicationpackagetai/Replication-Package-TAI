1. Energy-efficient design: Incorporating energy-efficient design features such as passive solar design, high-performance windows, and insulation can help reduce energy consumption and lower utility bills.

2. Renewable energy: Incorporating renewable energy sources such as solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal systems can help reduce reliance on non-renewable energy sources and lower greenhouse gas emissions.

3. Water conservation: Incorporating water-efficient fixtures and appliances, rainwater harvesting systems, and greywater recycling systems can help reduce water consumption and lower water bills.

4. Sustainable materials: Using sustainable building materials such as recycled wood, bamboo, and recycled metal can help reduce the environmental impact of construction and lower the carbon footprint of the development.

5. Green spaces: Incorporating green spaces such as parks, gardens, and green roofs can help improve air quality, reduce urban heat island effects, and provide recreational opportunities for residents.

6. Smart growth: Incorporating smart growth principles such as mixed-use development, walkability, and bikeability can help reduce the need for car travel and lower greenhouse gas emissions.

7. Waste reduction: Incorporating waste reduction strategies such as recycling and composting programs can help reduce the amount of waste generated by the development and lower the environmental impact of construction and operation.

8. Community engagement: Engaging with the local community and incorporating their feedback and ideas into the design process can help ensure that the development meets the needs of the community and is sustainable in the long term.

By incorporating these sustainable design features, housing developments can help reduce their environmental impact and create more livable, healthy, and sustainable communities."

### Explanation:
1. **HTML Structure**:
   - A `canvas` element is created with an ID of `drawingCanvas` and dimensions of 800x600 pixels.
   - A `style` block is included to add a border to the canvas for better visibility.

2. **JavaScript**:
   - The `canvas` element is retrieved using `document.getElementById`.
   - The `getContext('2d')` method is used to get the 2D rendering context of the canvas.
   - Event listeners are added to handle `mousedown`, `mousemove`, and `mouseup` events.
   - The `isDrawing` flag is used to determine whether the user is currently drawing.
   - The `lastX` and `lastY` variables store the last mouse position"

Moreover, could you share a Ruby script capable of producing a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table?","To create a comprehensive comparison chart in HTML table format between traditional education and online education, you can use Ruby to generate the HTML code. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```ruby
# Define the data for the comparison chart
data = [
  [""Aspect"", ""Traditional Education"", ""Online Education""],
  [""Cost"", ""High"", ""Low""],
  [""Flexibility"", ""Low"", ""High""],
  [""Interaction"", ""High"", ""Low""],
  [""Resources"", ""Limited"", ""Unlimited""],
  [""Learning Outcomes"", ""Varies"", ""Varies""]
]

# Generate the HTML table
html = ""<table border='1'>\n""
data.each do |row|
  html += ""  <tr>\n""
  row.each do |cell|
    html += ""    <td>#{cell}</td>\n""
  end
  html += ""  </tr>\n""
end
html += ""</table>""

# Output the HTML table
puts html
```

To create a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table, you can use the Ruby gem `gruff`. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```ruby
require 'gruff'

# Define the data for the bar graph
data = {
  ""Traditional Education"" => [100, 50, 80, 20, 50],
  ""Online Education"" => [50, 100, 30, 80, 50]
}

# Create a new bar graph
graph = Gruff::Bar.new

# Set the title and labels
graph.title = ""Comparison of Traditional and Online Education""
graph.labels = {
  0 => ""Cost"",
  1 => ""Flexibility"",
  2 => ""Interaction"",
  3 => ""Resources"",
  4 => ""Learning Outcomes""
}

# Add the data to the graph
data.each do |name, values|
  graph.data(name, values)
end

# Save the graph as an image file
graph.write(""comparison.png"")

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]
Student:","Sure, I can help you with that. Here's the solution for the given instance:

Solution: [45, 23, -3, -3, -49, -39, 43, 29, -49, -45, -39, 39]

Explanation: 
- The first inner list has 40, -36, 45, -47 as even numbers, so the first output is 45.
- The second list has -7, 39, 4, 23 as odd numbers, so the second output is 23.
- The third list has -26, -3, 32, 1 as even numbers, so the third output is -3.
- The fourth list has -3, 20, -14, -38 as odd numbers, so the fourth output is -3.
- The fifth list has -20, -26, -30, -46, -49 as even numbers, so the fifth output is -49.
- The sixth list has -19, 28, -39 as odd numbers, so the sixth output is -39.

1. First, we need to find the factors of 210. The factors of 210 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, and 210.

2. Next, we need to find the squares of each factor. The squares of the factors are 1, 4, 9, 25, 36, 49, 100, 196, 225, 441, 900, 1225, 1764, 4900, 11025, and 44100.

3. Now, we need to find the sum of these squares. We can do this by adding them up: 1 + 4 + 9 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 100 + 196 + 225 + 441 + 900 + 1225 + 1764 + 4900 + 11025 + 44100 = 72,840.

However, it's important to note that `v.ParentName` is not a built-in function or property in Lua. It's likely that you're referring to a specific context or a custom function or property.

In Lua, you can access the parent of an object using the `Parent` property. For example, if you have a variable `v` that represents an object, you can access its parent using `v.Parent`.

Here's an example:

```lua
local v = Instance.new(""Part"")
v.Parent = workspace
print(v.Parent.Name) -- Output: ""workspace""
```

If you want to access a specific property of the parent, you can use the dot notation. For example, if you want to access the `Name` property of the parent, you can use `v.Parent.Name`.

```lua
local v = Instance.new(""Part"")
v.Parent = workspace
print(v.Parent.Name) -- Output: ""workspace""
```

If you're referring to a specific context or a custom function or property, please provide more information so that I can give you a more accurate answer."

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the first quarter of 2020, making it the worst affected of major industrial nations, according to the latest official estimate."

This is because the = symbol is a special character in regex, and it is used to match the literal = symbol, not as a comparison operator.

For example, if you want to match the literal = symbol in a string, you can use the following regex pattern:

```
=\\=
```

This pattern will match the literal = symbol in the string, and not treat it as a comparison operator.

Here's an example of how you can use this pattern in Python:

```python
import re

string = ""This is a test string with a literal = symbol in it.""

pattern = ""=\\=""

matches = re.findall(pattern, string)

print(matches)
```

This will output:

```
['=']
```

As you can see, the pattern matches the literal = symbol in the string, and not as a comparison operator."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Sure, I can paraphrase Kimmel's statement and connect it to his critique of Trump's accomplishments. Kimmel noted that Trump has played golf more than any other president in history, which is a presidential record. However, Kimmel suggested that people who say Trump hasn't accomplished anything should do something positive, like sign up for the Affordable Care Act's open-enrollment period.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

The Lake District, located in the northwest of England, is a place that has always made me feel happy and content. Nestled in the heart of the English countryside, this picturesque region is a haven for nature lovers and outdoor enthusiasts. The rolling hills, lush greenery, and crystal-clear lakes create a breathtaking landscape that is both calming and invigorating.

As I step out of my car and onto the well-trodden path, I am immediately enveloped by the fresh, crisp air that fills my lungs. The scent of pine and earthy soil fills my nostrils, and the sound of birds chirping and the rustling of leaves in the breeze fills my ears. The sun is shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the landscape, and the sky is a brilliant blue, with only a few fluffy clouds dotting the horizon.

As I walk along the path, I am surrounded by the beauty of the Lake District. The hills are covered in a lush green blanket of grass and wildflowers, and the lakes are a mirror to the sky, reflecting the vibrant colors of the surrounding landscape. The water is crystal clear, and the fish can be seen swimming beneath the surface, creating a mesmerizing scene.

As I continue my walk, I come across a small, secluded lake that is surrounded by towering trees. The water is still and calm, and the only sound is the gentle lapping of the waves against the shore. I sit down on a nearby rock and take in the peacefulness of the moment. The sun is setting, and the sky is painted with a beautiful array of colors, from deep oranges and pinks to soft purples and blues. The birds are singing their evening songs, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of wildflowers.

As I leave the Lake District, I am filled with a sense of contentment and happiness. The beauty of this place has a way of lifting my spirits and filling my heart with joy. It is a place that I will always cherish and return to whenever I need a break from the hustle and bustle of everyday life."

1. **Azure Storage Queues Setup:**
   - Create an Azure Storage account if you don't have one already.
   - Within the storage account, create a queue for each company. For example, `CompanyAQueue` and `CompanyBQueue`.

2. **Company A Data Preparation:**
   - Company A prepares the data to be sent to Company B.
   - The data is serialized into a format that can be easily stored and retrieved (e.g., JSON, XML).
   - The serialized data is then sent to the `CompanyBQueue` using the Azure Storage Queue API.

3. **Company B Data Retrieval:**
   - Company B sets up a listener or a scheduled task to periodically check the `CompanyBQueue` for new messages.
   - When a new message is detected, Company B retrieves the message from the queue.
   - The message is deserialized back into its original format.
   - Company B processes the data as needed.

4. **Data Processing and Acknowledgment:**
   - After processing the data, Company B acknowledges the message by deleting it from the queue.
   - This ensures that the message is not processed again if the system fails or if the message is not acknowledged.

5. **Error Handling and Retry Mechanism:**
   - Implement error handling to manage any issues that may arise during data exchange.
   - Configure the queue to have a retry policy to handle transient errors and ensure data integrity.

6. **Security and Authentication:**
   - Ensure that the data exchange is secure by using Azure Storage account keys and implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Consider using Azure Active Directory (AAD) for secure access control.

7. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Set up monitoring and logging to track the data exchange process and identify any issues.
   - Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights to gather insights and troubleshoot problems.

8. **Scalability and Performance:**
   - Design the system to handle varying levels of data volume and traffic.
   - Consider using Azure Functions or Azure Logic Apps to automate the data processing and handling.

9. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Thoroughly test the data exchange process to ensure it works as expected.
   - Validate the data integrity and accuracy at each step of the process.

10. **Documentation and Maintenance:**
    - Document the"

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode a long string into a short string for sharing via a URL, you can use a URL encoding technique. In JavaScript, you can use the `encodeURIComponent()` function to encode the string. This function converts special characters in a string to their corresponding URL-encoded values.

Here's an example of how you can use `encodeURIComponent()` to encode a long string:

```javascript
const longString = ""This is a long string that needs to be encoded for sharing via a URL."";
const encodedString = encodeURIComponent(longString);
console.log(encodedString);
```

The `encodeURIComponent()` function will convert the long string into a URL-encoded string, which can be safely shared via a URL.

To decode the shared string, you can use the `decodeURIComponent()` function. Here's an example:

```javascript
const encodedString = ""This%20is%20a%20long%20string%20that%20needs%20to%20be%20encoded%20for%20sharing%20via%20a%20URL."";
const decodedString = decodeURIComponent(encodedString);
console.log(decodedString);
```

The `decodeURIComponent()` function will convert the URL-encoded string back into its original form.

Keep in mind that the encoded string will be longer than the original string due to the URL encoding process. However, it will be safe to share via a URL and can be easily decoded back into the original string."

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node using Heuristic search, we can use the A* algorithm. A* is a popular algorithm for finding the shortest path between two points in a grid. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of reaching the goal from any given point in the grid.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to use A* to find the optimal path for PacMan:

1. Initialize the start and goal nodes: PacMan is at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3).
2. Create a priority queue to store the nodes to be explored. The priority queue is ordered by the sum of the cost of reaching the node and the heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal from that node. The cost of reaching a node is the sum of the costs of the edges traversed to reach that node. The heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal from a node is the Manhattan distance between the node and the goal node.
3. Create a dictionary to store the cost of reaching each node. Initialize the cost of reaching the start node to 0 and the cost of reaching all other nodes to infinity.
4. Create a dictionary to store the parent of each node. Initialize the parent of the start node to None and the parent of all other nodes to None.
5. Add the start node to the priority queue.
6. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:
   a. Remove the node with the lowest cost from the priority queue.
   b. If the node is the goal node, reconstruct the path from the start node to the goal node using the parent dictionary and return the path.
   c. For each neighbor of the node, do the following:
      i. Calculate the cost of reaching the neighbor from the current node.
      ii. If the cost of reaching the neighbor is less than the cost of reaching the neighbor stored in the cost dictionary, update the cost dictionary and the parent dictionary.
      iii. Add the neighbor to the priority queue.
7. If the goal node is not reached, return None.

Using the A* algorithm, the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)."

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.

Character 1: Alex
Alex is a 28-year-old software engineer who has been working at a tech company for the past five years. He is a hardworking and dedicated employee, but he is also a bit of a perfectionist. He is always striving to improve his work and is often critical of himself and others. Alex is also a bit of a loner and doesn't have many close friends.

Character 2: Jamie
Jamie is a 27-year-old marketing specialist who has been working at the same tech company as Alex for the past three years. She is a friendly and outgoing person who enjoys socializing and making new friends. Jamie is also a bit of a risk-taker and is always looking for new and exciting experiences.

Conflict:
Alex and Jamie are in conflict because they have very different work styles and personalities. Alex is a perfectionist who is always striving to improve his work, while Jamie is a risk-taker who is always looking for new and exciting experiences. This has led to a number of conflicts between them, as Alex often criticizes Jamie's work and Jamie often criticizes Alex's work.

For example, Alex and Jamie are working on a new marketing campaign for the company. Alex is very focused on making sure that every detail of the campaign is perfect, while Jamie is more focused on coming up with new and exciting ideas. This has led to a number of disagreements between them, as Alex is critical of Jamie's ideas and Jamie is critical of Alex's attention to detail.

Another example of their conflict is that Alex is a loner who doesn't have many close friends, while Jamie is a friendly and outgoing person who enjoys socializing and making new friends. This has led to a number of misunderstandings between them, as Alex often feels like Jamie is trying to be his friend, while Jamie often feels like Alex is too focused on his work to be a good friend.

Overall, Alex and Jamie are in conflict because they have very different work styles and personalities, and they are struggling to find a way to work together effectively."

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross.

These variations can be attributed to several factors, including climate, habitat, and the availability of hosts. Here are some key differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus across different regions:

1. Climate: Tabanus species are generally more active in warm and humid climates, which can affect their flight patterns. In regions with colder temperatures, Tabanus may be less active and may exhibit more erratic flight patterns.

2. Habitat: Tabanus species are found in a wide range of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands. The flight patterns of Tabanus can vary depending on the specific habitat in which they are found. For example, in forests, Tabanus may exhibit more erratic flight patterns due to the dense vegetation, while in grasslands, they may exhibit more straight and predictable flight patterns.

3. Host availability: The availability of hosts can also affect the flight patterns of Tabanus. In regions where there are more hosts available, such as areas with large populations of livestock, Tabanus may exhibit more frequent and predictable flight patterns. In regions with fewer hosts, Tabanus may exhibit more erratic flight patterns.

4. Seasonal variations: Tabanus species exhibit seasonal variations in their flight patterns, with peak activity occurring during the warmer months. In regions with distinct seasons, Tabanus may exhibit different flight patterns during different times of the year.

Overall, the flight patterns of Tabanus can vary significantly across different regions, and these variations can be attributed to a combination of factors, including climate, habitat, host availability, and seasonal variations."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
