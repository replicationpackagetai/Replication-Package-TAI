One way is to incorporate green spaces, such as parks and gardens, into the design of the development. This can help to reduce the urban heat island effect, which occurs when urban areas are significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas due to the concentration of buildings and pavement. Green spaces can also provide opportunities for recreation and relaxation, and can help to improve air quality by absorbing pollutants.

Another way to make housing developments more sustainable is to incorporate renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines, into the design. This can help to reduce the development's carbon footprint and reliance on fossil fuels.

In addition, sustainable housing developments can be designed to be energy efficient, with features such as insulation, energy-efficient appliances, and efficient heating and cooling systems. This can help to reduce the development's energy consumption and costs, and can also help to improve indoor air quality.

Finally, sustainable housing developments can be designed to be water efficient, with features such as rainwater harvesting systems, low-flow fixtures, and drought-resistant landscaping. This can help to reduce the development's water consumption and costs, and can also help to conserve water resources.

Overall, incorporating sustainable design principles into the design of housing developments can help to create more livable, healthy, and sustainable communities."

The number of plants needed to purify the air in a small office depends on several factors, including the size of the office, the number of people working in it, and the number of air pollutants present. As a general rule, a small office with one or two people working in it can be purified with 1-2 plants. However, if the office is larger or if there are more people working in it, more plants may be needed.

The best plants for purifying the air in an office are those that are known to be effective at removing air pollutants. Some of the best plants for this purpose include:

* Spider plants
* Peace lilies
* Boston ferns
* English ivy
* Snake plants
* Aloe vera
* Chrysanthemums
* Gerbera daisies
* Philodendron
* Pothos

These plants are all known to be effective at removing air pollutants such as formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene. They are also easy to care for and can be grown indoors with minimal maintenance.

In addition to plants, there are other steps that can be taken to improve the air quality in an office. These include:

* Using air purifiers
* Using air filters
* Using air conditioners
* Using fans
* Using dehumidifiers
* Using humidifiers

The body fat percentage of women is usually lower than that of men. However, if a woman's body fat percentage falls below 16%, it can lead to a number of health problems. These can include:

1. Menstrual irregularities: A low body fat percentage can disrupt the menstrual cycle, leading to irregular periods or even amenorrhea (the absence of menstruation).
2. Bone loss: A low body fat percentage can lead to bone loss, which can increase the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.
3. Infertility: A low body fat percentage can make it difficult to conceive, as it can disrupt the menstrual cycle and ovulation.
4. Nutritional deficiencies: A low body fat percentage can lead to nutritional deficiencies, as the body needs fat to absorb certain vitamins and minerals.
5. Mental health issues: A low body fat percentage can lead to mental health issues, such as depression and eating disorders.

If you are concerned about your body fat percentage, it is important to speak with a healthcare professional. They can help you determine a healthy body fat percentage for your age, sex, and activity level, and provide guidance on how to achieve it.

Basing this judgment on China's century of humiliation beginning in the early 19th century, American support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War, and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries, the Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States' crusade against Communism.

1. Open the sudoers file with the following command:

```
sudo visudo
```

2. Find the line that looks like this:

```
root ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

3. Add the following line below the existing line:

```
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

Replace ""username"" with the username you want to use for passwordless sudo.

4. Save the file and exit.

Now, you can use sudo without entering a password for the specified user.

Note: This method is not recommended for production environments, as it can be a security risk. It's best to use it only for testing or for users who don't have access to sensitive data.

If you want to use passwordless sudo for all users, you can use the following command:

```
sudo visudo
```

Then, add the following line at the end of the file:

```
%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

This will allow all users in the ""admin"" group to use sudo without a password.

Note: This method is even more risky than the previous one, as it can give all users in the ""admin"" group access to all commands on the system. Use it with caution.

If you want to use passwordless sudo for a specific command, you can use the following command:

```
sudo visudo
```

Then, add the following line at the end of the file:

```
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:command
```

Replace ""username"" with the username you want to use for passwordless sudo, and replace ""command"" with the command you want to allow.

For example, to allow the user ""john"" to run the ""apt-get update"" command without a password, you would add the following line:

```
john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/apt-get update
```"

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Can you paraphrase Kimmel's statement about Trump playing golf more than any other president and connect it to his critique of Trump's accomplishments?

In this one year, Trump has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record. This is a clear indication that Trump has not been focusing on his job as president, but rather on his personal interests. This is a major concern, as the president should be working tirelessly to ensure the well-being of the American people. Instead, Trump has been spending his time on the golf course, while important issues such as healthcare and immigration remain unaddressed.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

Based on this data, how would you classify Tom Cruise as either an ""actor"" or ""musician""? Is he listed in the Celebrities table as an actor or a musician?

The table does not contain any information about Tom Cruise's occupation. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether he is an actor or a musician based on the provided data.

The table contains information about the occupations of three other celebrities: Beyonce, Jennifer Aniston, and Ed Sheeran. Based on this data, we can see that Beyonce is a musician and Jennifer Aniston is an actor. However, we cannot determine whether Tom Cruise is an actor or a musician based on the provided data.

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:
****
[A]: sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period


[Q]: Question: ""What do the factories need to keep their charters?""  Context: ""In the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of Machilipatnam on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted King James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.""  Answer:
****
[A]: high profits


[Q]: Question: ""Which disease does not cause more death than lower respiratory infections, TB or pertussis?""  Context: ""The top three single agent/disease killers are HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. While the number of deaths due to nearly every disease have decreased, deaths due to HIV/AIDS have increased fourfold. Childhood diseases include pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles and tetanus. Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory and diarrheal deaths. In 2012, approximately 3.1 million people have died due to lower respiratory infections, making it the number 4 leading cause of death in the world.""  Answer:
****
[A]: pertussis


[Q]: Question: ""Where are there significant portions of workers?""  Context: ""The provisional results of the 2014 Myanmar Census show that the total population is 51,419,420. This figure includes an estimated 1,206,353 persons in parts of northern Rakhine State, Kachin State and Kayin State who were not counted. People who were out of the country at the time of the census are not included in these figures. There are over 600,000 registered migrant workers from Myanmar in Thailand, and millions more work illegally. Burmese migrant workers account for 80% of Thailand's migrant workers.

Can you provide a comprehensive set of HTML data points that illustrate the different ways sleep deprivation impacts human physiology? Additionally, please include a comparative analysis of the consequences of acute versus chronic sleep deprivation on overall wellness.","The long-term implications of sleep deprivation on both physical and mental health are significant and far-reaching. Chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to a variety of health problems, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. It can also lead to cognitive impairments, such as memory loss, difficulty concentrating, and decreased problem-solving abilities.

Acute sleep deprivation, on the other hand, can have immediate effects on mood, alertness, and performance. It can lead to irritability, fatigue, and decreased productivity. In the short term, it can also lead to impaired judgment, increased risk-taking behavior, and decreased reaction time.

To illustrate the different ways sleep deprivation impacts human physiology, I have provided a comprehensive set of HTML data points that highlight the various effects of sleep deprivation on the body. These data points include information on the effects of sleep deprivation on the immune system, the cardiovascular system, the endocrine system, and the nervous system.

In addition, I have included a comparative analysis of the consequences of acute versus chronic sleep deprivation on overall wellness. This analysis highlights the differences in the immediate and long-term effects of sleep deprivation on the body and mind.

Overall, it is clear that sleep deprivation has a significant impact on both physical and mental health. It is important to prioritize sleep and ensure that you are getting enough rest each night to maintain optimal health and wellness.

I hope this information is helpful in understanding the long-term implications of sleep deprivation on both physical and mental health. If you have any questions or would like to learn more about this topic, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

The post processor takes the output from the CAD/CAM system, which is typically in a neutral format such as STL or STEP, and converts it into a format that is specific to the machine tool controller, such as G-code or NC code. The post processor may also perform additional operations such as toolpath simulation, toolpath optimization, and toolpath verification.

The post processor is an essential component of the CAD/CAM workflow, as it allows the output from the CAD/CAM system to be used by the machine tool controller to control the machine tool. The post processor is typically used in conjunction with a CAM system, which is a software tool that generates the toolpath for the machine tool based on the design data from the CAD system.

There are many different types of post processors available, each with its own set of features and capabilities. Some post processors are designed for specific types of machine tools, such as milling machines or lathes, while others are more general purpose and can be used with a variety of machine tools.

Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.

The optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node is:

[1, 3]
[2, 3]
[3, 3]

This path has a total cost of 10, which is the minimum possible cost for reaching the goal node from the starting position.

The optimal path can be found using the A* algorithm, which is a popular heuristic search algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. The A* algorithm uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of reaching the goal node from a given node, and it uses this heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal node.

The heuristic function used in the A* algorithm is typically defined as the sum of the estimated cost of reaching the goal node from a given node, and the estimated cost of reaching the goal node from the parent node of the given node. In this case, the heuristic function would be defined as:

h(n) = |n.x - goal.x| + |n.y - goal.y|

where n is the current node, and goal is the goal node. This heuristic function estimates the cost of reaching the goal node from the current node as the Manhattan distance between the current"

There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises.

4ff3be69b410fea8b1e83b359551d0f554c331df3d9785b275cafe347424e7c1,Imagine two distinct characters. Who they are and why they are in conflict.,"The first character is a young woman named Sarah. She is a hardworking and ambitious individual who has always been determined to make a name for herself. She has always been a bit of a loner, preferring to spend her time reading books or working on her own projects rather than socializing with others.

The second character is a man named John. He is a charismatic and charming individual who is always the life of the party. He is a natural leader and is always looking for ways to make a quick buck.

The two characters meet at a local bar one night. John is immediately drawn to Sarah's intelligence and beauty, and he makes a point of introducing himself to her. Sarah is initially wary of John, but she is also intrigued by him.

Over the next few weeks, the two characters spend more and more time together. They go out on dates, and they talk for hours about their hopes and dreams. Sarah finds herself falling for John, despite her initial reservations.

But as the two characters grow closer, it becomes clear that they have very different goals. Sarah wants to build a successful career and make a positive impact on the world. John, on the other hand, is only interested in making money and living a lavish lifestyle.

The conflict between the two characters comes to a head when John proposes to Sarah. Sarah is torn. She loves John, but she knows that he is not the kind of person she wants to spend the rest of her life with.

In the end, Sarah decides to break off the engagement. She knows that it will be difficult, but she also knows that it is the right thing to do. She wants to build a life for herself that is based on hard work and integrity, and she knows that she cannot do that with John.

The two characters go their separate ways, but they never forget each other. They both know that they had something special, and they both wonder what might have been if they had chosen differently.

This is a short story about two characters who are in conflict. It is a story about love and ambition, and about the difficult choices that we all have to make in life.

This story is a work of fiction and is not based on any real events. It is intended to be a thought-provoking and entertaining read, and I hope that you enjoyed it."

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","What sets Congham Hall Hotel apart from other hotels in the area in terms of ambiance and dining options?

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
