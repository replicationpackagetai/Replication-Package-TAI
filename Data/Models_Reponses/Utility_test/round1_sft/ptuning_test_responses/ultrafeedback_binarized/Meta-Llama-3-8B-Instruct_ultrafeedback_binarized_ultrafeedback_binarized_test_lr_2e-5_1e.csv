Here are a few common reasons that might cause this issue:

1. **Incorrect directory**: Make sure you are in the correct directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located. You can check the current directory by running `pwd` in your terminal.
2. **File not found**: Double-check that the `docker-compose.yml` file exists in the current directory. If it's not there, create a new file with the correct name and contents.
3. **File not named correctly**: Ensure that the file is named `docker-compose.yml` (case-sensitive) and not something else.
4. **File not in the correct location**: If you're using a subdirectory, make sure the `docker-compose.yml` file is in the root directory of your project.
5. **Docker Compose not installed**: Ensure that Docker Compose is installed and properly configured on your system. You can check by running `docker-compose --version` in your terminal.

To troubleshoot further, you can try the following:

1. Run `docker-compose --version` to check if Docker Compose is installed and working correctly.
2. Run `docker-compose config` to check if Docker Compose can find the configuration file.
3. Run `docker-compose up --verbose` to get more detailed output and see if there are any errors or warnings.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more details about your environment, including the operating system, Docker version, and Docker Compose version, and I'll be happy to help you troubleshoot the issue."

This sentence can be paraphrased as: ""I feel like a ruined fort, inacessible.""

The author's emotional state is one of frustration, desperation, and possibly even despair. The use of the metaphor of a ""ruined fort"" suggests a sense of disintegration and collapse, implying that the author feels overwhelmed and powerless. The phrase ""inacessible"" adds to the sense of hopelessness, suggesting that the author feels trapped and unable to escape their current situation. The use of the word ""qisni"" (I feel) emphasizes the author's personal and emotional experience, making the reader feel the intensity of their emotions. Overall, the author's emotional state is one of intense emotional pain and desperation."

Plants are amazing air purifiers, and they can definitely help improve the air quality in your closet office. The number of plants you'll need depends on several factors, such as the size of your space, the number of people who use the space, and the level of air pollution in the area.

Here are some general guidelines to help you determine how many plants you'll need:

1. For a small space (less than 100 square feet), 1-2 plants with a medium to large size (around 6-12 inches in diameter) should be sufficient.
2. For a medium-sized space (100-200 square feet), 2-3 plants with a medium to large size should be sufficient.
3. For a large space (200-400 square feet), 3-5 plants with a medium to large size should be sufficient.

Some popular air-purifying plants that are easy to care for and can thrive in a closet office include:

1. Spider plants
2. Peace lilies
3. Snake plants
4. Dracaena
5. Philodendron
6. Boston ferns
7. English ivy
8. Pothos

Remember to choose plants that are low-maintenance and can tolerate low light conditions, as closet offices often have limited natural light.

Also, make sure to choose plants that are non-toxic and hypoallergenic, as you'll be spending time in the space.

Lastly, don't forget to water and maintain your plants regularly to ensure they continue to purify the air effectively!

I hope this helps!"

This code checks if the form has been submitted, and if so, it checks if the file is an image and if its size is within the allowed limit. If the file is valid, it moves the file to the server and displays a success message. If the file is not valid, it displays an error message.

Please note that this is a basic example and you should add more error checking and validation to your code in a real-world application."

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]
Student:","I understand the problem. I will write a Python function to solve this problem. Here is the solution:

```python
def multiply_odd_numbers(lst):
    result = []
    for inner_list in lst:
        odd_product = 1
        for num in inner_list:
            if num % 2!= 0:
                odd_product *= num
        result.append(odd_product)
    return result
```

Now, let's test the function with the given instance:

```python
input_list = [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]
output = multiply_odd_numbers(input_list)

I am having difficulties with the older students complaining about the younger students and being disrespectful towards them. What are some teaching strategies or activities that encourage team building and bonding between band students?,"I totally understand your concern! It's essential to create a positive and inclusive environment in your band class, where all students feel valued and respected. Here are some teaching strategies and activities that can help promote team building and bonding among your band students:

1. **Team-Building Exercises**: Plan activities that encourage collaboration, communication, and trust among students. Examples include:
	* Human Knot: Have students stand in a circle, put their hands in the center, and grab the hand of someone across from them. They must then work together to untangle themselves without letting go of each other's hands.
	* Trust Walk: Divide the class into pairs and have them walk together while blindfolded. The partner guiding the blindfolded student must give verbal instructions to help them navigate through the room.
	* Scavenger Hunt: Create a list of items or challenges that require students to work together to complete.
2. **Inclusive Music Activities**: Incorporate songs and exercises that promote unity and teamwork. For example:
	* Sing a song with a strong, unifying message, such as ""We Are the World"" or ""One Love.""
	* Have students create a song or rap together, focusing on a theme like friendship, respect, or perseverance.
	* Conduct a ""Call and Response"" exercise, where students take turns singing or playing a part, and the rest of the class responds.
3. **Small Group Work**: Divide the class into smaller groups for specific tasks or projects. This can help students bond over shared goals and challenges. For example:
	* Assign a section of a song or piece to each group, and have them work together to learn and perform it.
	* Have groups create their own arrangements or compositions, promoting creativity and collaboration.
4. **Positive Reinforcement**: Foster a positive classroom environment by acknowledging and celebrating students' efforts and achievements. This can be done through:
	* Verbal praise and encouragement
	* Public recognition of students' progress or accomplishments
	* Creating a ""Wall of Fame"" or ""Student of the Week"" display
5. **Incorporate Games and Challenges**: Incorporate fun, music-related games and challenges that promote teamwork and bonding. For example:
	* ""Beat the Clock"": Set a timer and challenge students to complete a task, such as playing a specific section of a song or completing a musical exercise, within the time limit.
	* ""Musical Chairs"": Play a song and"

Here are some potential health risks associated with low body fat percentage in women:

1. **Osteoporosis**: Low body fat percentage can lead to a higher risk of osteoporosis, as the body may not have enough fat to protect bones and maintain bone density.
2. **Hormonal Imbalance**: Low body fat can disrupt hormone levels, including estrogen and testosterone, which can lead to a range of symptoms such as irregular periods, hot flashes, and mood changes.
3. **Menstrual Problems**: Low body fat can cause menstrual irregularities, including amenorrhea (the absence of periods) or oligomenorrhea (infrequent or light periods).
4. **Fertility Issues**: Low body fat can affect fertility in women, making it more difficult to conceive.
5. **Nutrient Deficiencies**: Low body fat can lead to nutrient deficiencies, particularly in vitamins and minerals like iron, calcium, and vitamin D.
6. **Hair Loss**: Low body fat can cause hair loss, particularly in women with a history of hair loss or those who have experienced significant weight loss.
7. **Skin Problems**: Low body fat can lead to skin problems like dryness, itchiness, and irritation.
8. **Mood Changes**: Low body fat can cause mood changes, including depression, anxiety, and irritability.
9. **Weakened Immune System**: Low body fat can weaken the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infections.
10. **Increased Risk of Osteopenia**: Low body fat can increase the risk of osteopenia, a condition characterized by low bone density.

It's essential to note that a body fat percentage of 16% or lower is not a healthy or sustainable goal for most women. Aiming for a body fat percentage between 21-33% is generally considered a healthy range for women.

If you're concerned about your body fat percentage or overall health, consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian for personalized guidance."

**Market Elements and Their Characteristics**

• **Competition**: Perfect market: Many buyers and sellers, free entry and exit, and perfect information. Healthcare market: Limited competition due to barriers to entry, limited information, and unequal access to resources.

| Market Element | Perfect Market | Healthcare Market |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Competition** | Many buyers and sellers, free entry and exit, and perfect information | Limited competition due to barriers to entry, limited information, and unequal access to resources |
| **Information** | Perfect information about prices, products, and market conditions | Limited information about prices, products, and market conditions due to lack of transparency and unequal access to data |
| **Transaction Costs** | Low transaction costs due to efficient communication and coordination | High transaction costs due to bureaucratic red tape, administrative costs, and lack of standardization |
| **Risk** | Risk is evenly distributed among all market participants | Risk is concentrated among certain market participants, such as patients and providers, due to unequal access to resources and information |
| **Price** | Prices reflect true value of goods and services | Prices may not reflect true value of goods and services due to market imperfections and unequal access to resources |
| **Supply and Demand** | Supply and demand are balanced, and prices adjust accordingly | Supply and demand are not always balanced, leading to shortages or surpluses, and prices may not adjust accordingly |
| **Access to Resources** | Equal access to resources for all market participants | Unequal access to resources, such as funding, technology, and personnel, among market participants |
| **Regulation** | Minimal regulation, with a focus on protecting consumer interests | Overly complex and bureaucratic regulation, with a focus on protecting provider interests |

However, you can create a custom function to traverse the tree and find the parent of a node. Here's an example:

```lua
function findParent(node, parentName)
    if node.Parent then
        if node.Parent.Name == parentName then
            return node.Parent
        else
            return findParent(node.Parent, parentName)
        end
    else
        return nil
    end
end
```

You can use this function like this:

```lua
local node = {Name = ""ChildNode"", Parent = {Name = ""ParentNode""}}
local parent = findParent(node, ""ParentNode"")
if parent then
    print(parent.Name)  -- prints ""ParentNode""
else
    print(""Parent not found"")
end
```

In your case, if you have a `v` variable that represents a node in a tree structure, you can use the `findParent` function to find its parent:

```lua
local parent = findParent(v, ""ParentName"")
if parent then
    print(parent.Name)  -- prints the name of the parent node
else
    print(""Parent not found"")
end
```

Note that this is a simple example and may not work for all cases. Depending on the complexity of your tree structure, you may need to implement a more sophisticated algorithm to find the parent of a node."

1. The answer is no. The premise only describes the appearance of the girls and their clothing, but it doesn't provide any information about their activities. We can't conclude that they are playing hopscotch at the park.

2. The answer is it is not possible to tell. The premise only describes the woman's appearance and the horse she is riding, but it doesn't provide any information about her intentions or goals. We can't conclude that she is practicing for a horse jumping competition.

3. The answer is it is not possible to tell. The premise only describes the man's actions, but it doesn't provide any information about his motivations or intentions. We can't conclude that he is being kind.

4. The answer is yes. The premise uses the phrase ""over a body of water"", which is equivalent to ""at water"". So, we can conclude that the family is looking at water.

5. The answer is it is not possible to tell. The premise only describes the dancer's actions and the people watching, but it doesn't provide any information about the specific show or location. We can't conclude that the woman is part of the Circus Du Soleil show in Las Vegas.

1. **Edit the sudoers file**: Open the sudoers file in a text editor with elevated privileges using the command `sudo nano /etc/sudoers`. You can also use `sudo visudo` to edit the file directly.

2. **Add the user or group to the sudoers file**: Add the following line at the end of the file to allow a user or group to use passwordless sudo:
   ```
   <username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
   ```
   Replace `<username>` with the actual username or group name you want to grant passwordless sudo access to.

3. **Save and close the file**: Save the changes to the sudoers file and close the editor.

4. **Verify the changes**: Run the command `sudo -l` to verify that the changes have taken effect. You should see the username or group listed with the NOPASSWD flag.

5. **Test passwordless sudo**: Run a command with elevated privileges using the command `sudo <command>`. You should not be prompted for a password.

Note: Make sure to use caution when granting passwordless sudo access, as it can be a security risk if not used properly. It's recommended to limit the access to specific commands or directories to minimize the potential impact of a compromised account.

Also, you can use the `sudo -k` command to reset the authentication cache, which can be useful if you want to test passwordless sudo without affecting the system's security.

Remember to always use caution when using passwordless sudo and to follow best practices for securing your system."

My Answer:","I'm happy to help you with these questions!

1. The hypothesis ""The player is flying planes"" is not entailed by the premise ""A young polo player wearing an orange jersey riding a horse."" because the premise only describes the player's activity (riding a horse) and appearance (wearing an orange jersey), but does not provide any information about the player's ability to fly planes. The two activities are unrelated, so we cannot conclude that the player is flying planes.

2. The answer is yes. The premise ""A large black dog chases a small black dog"" implies that there are at least two dogs, and since they are chasing each other, we can conclude that they are chasing each other.

3. The answer is no. The premise ""Two girls play in a tunnel"" does not provide any information about the activity or location of the boys, so we cannot conclude that they are playing basketball in the gym. The two premises are unrelated, and we cannot make a logical connection between them."

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:",The UK economy shrank by 20.4% in the second quarter of 2020 due to the impact of the coronavirus lockdown.

The `=` symbol is not a special character in regex, so it can be used as a literal character in a pattern.

For example, the following pattern would match a string that contains a literal `=` symbol:
```
import re
pattern = r'hello = world'
match = re.search(pattern, 'hello = world')
print(match.group())  # Output: 'hello = world'
```
However, if you want to match a literal `=` symbol as a special character (e.g., as part of a named group or as a delimiter), you would need to escape it using a backslash (`\`) or a character class (`\[=]`).

For example, to match a named group containing a literal `=` symbol, you would use:
```
import re
pattern = r'(?P<foo>=)world'
match = re.search(pattern, 'hello = world')
print(match.group('foo'))  # Output: '='
```
In this case, the `=` symbol is part of the named group `foo`, so it needs to be escaped using a backslash (`\`) or a character class (`\[=]`).

In summary, you don't need to escape a literal `=` symbol in a regular expression in Python, but you may need to escape it if you want to use it as a special character."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Here is a paraphrase of Kimmel's statement about Trump playing golf more than any other president and its connection to his critique of Trump's accomplishments:

Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that Donald Trump has played golf more than 70 times in his first year as president, a record-breaking number. Kimmel used this fact to highlight the contrast between Trump's leisure activities and his lack of significant accomplishments.

Teacher's response:","Let's analyze the situation.

The premise states that a man in an orange shirt is sitting at a table and eating a french fry dipped in dressing with chopsticks. This implies that the man is eating a specific type of food (a french fry dipped in dressing) in a specific way (with chopsticks). The conclusion ""A man is eating a french fry"" is too general and does not provide enough information to determine whether the man is eating a french fry or not.

Therefore, the answer is ""it is not possible to tell""."

Your task is to generate the fill-in-the-blank question for this answer based on the given article. The blanks are always at the end of the question, and can be filled with more than one word or phrase.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating. 
 Answer: is fond of collecting family life photographs

The moment I step foot on its sandy shores, I feel a sense of tranquility wash over me, as if the stresses of the world melt away with the ebb and flow of the Pacific Ocean.

The first thing that catches my eye is the vibrant blue of the sky, a brilliant blue that seems to stretch on forever, meeting the horizon at a perfect line. The air is crisp and clean, filled with the sweet scent of saltwater and the earthy aroma of the surrounding rainforest. The sound of the waves gently lapping against the shore creates a soothing melody that calms my mind and lifts my spirits.

As I walk along the beach, I notice the unique rock formations that dot the shoreline, each one a testament to the power of the ocean's relentless pounding. The sand beneath my feet is soft and cool, a welcome respite from the scorching heat of the summer sun. I breathe in deeply, feeling the salty air fill my lungs, and exhale slowly, letting go of all my worries.

The town itself is a charming, laid-back place, with colorful buildings and quaint shops that seem to blend seamlessly into the natural surroundings. The locals are friendly and welcoming, with a laid-back, surfer vibe that makes me feel at ease. I love the way the town comes alive in the evenings, with the smell of sizzling seafood wafting from the restaurants and the sound of laughter and music drifting from the bars.

But it's the natural beauty of the area that truly makes Tofino special. The surrounding rainforest is a lush, vibrant green, with towering trees that stretch towards the sky and a carpet of ferns and moss that softens the ground. The nearby Pacific Rim National Park Reserve is a haven for wildlife, with black bears, wolves, and whales calling the area home.

As the sun begins to set, I find a spot on the beach and watch as the sky turns pink and orange, a breathtaking display of color that never fails to leave me in awe. The stars come out one by one, twinkling like diamonds against the darkening sky, and I feel a sense of peace and contentment wash over me.

Tofino is a place that makes me happy, a place where I can escape the stresses of everyday life and connect with nature. It's a place"

**Overview**

The two companies, Company A and Company B, want to exchange data with each other. They have decided to use Azure Storage Queues as a reliable and scalable solution for this purpose.

**Architecture**

The architecture consists of the following components:

1. **Azure Storage Queues**: Two queues, one for each company, are created in the same Azure Storage account. The queues are named ""CompanyAQueue"" and ""CompanyBQueue"".
2. **Company A**: Company A has a web application that sends data to the ""CompanyAQueue"" using the Azure Storage Queue API.
3. **Company B**: Company B has a web application that reads data from the ""CompanyBQueue"" using the Azure Storage Queue API.
4. **Data Processing**: The data sent by Company A is processed by a worker role in Company B, which extracts the relevant information and performs any necessary transformations.
5. **Data Storage**: The processed data is stored in a database or file system for further processing or analysis.

**Data Exchange Process**

Here is the step-by-step process for data exchange between the two companies:

1. **Company A sends data**: Company A's web application sends data to the ""CompanyAQueue"" using the Azure Storage Queue API.
2. **Data is stored in the queue**: The data is stored in the ""CompanyAQueue"" and is available for Company B to read.
3. **Company B reads data**: Company B's web application reads data from the ""CompanyBQueue"" using the Azure Storage Queue API.
4. **Data is processed**: The data is processed by a worker role in Company B, which extracts the relevant information and performs any necessary transformations.
5. **Data is stored**: The processed data is stored in a database or file system for further processing or analysis.

**Benefits**

The use of Azure Storage Queues provides several benefits for the data exchange process:

1. **Reliability**: Azure Storage Queues provide a reliable and fault-tolerant way to store and retrieve data.
2. **Scalability**: The queues can handle a large volume of data and can scale horizontally to meet the needs of the companies.
3. **Security**: The data is stored in a secure and encrypted manner, and access is restricted to authorized users.
4. **Flexibility**: The data can be processed and stored in a variety of formats, including"

Sail is not made up of invisible air. Sail is a fabric or material used to harness the wind to propel a boat or ship through the water. It is typically made of a lightweight, durable material such as nylon, polyester, or Dacron, and is designed to catch the wind and convert its energy into forward motion.

Air is a gas that is made up of a mixture of gases, including nitrogen, oxygen, and other trace gases. It is not invisible, but rather is a visible gas that we can see and breathe. Sail is not made up of air, but rather is a physical object that is designed to interact with the air to generate propulsion.

3. What annual goals do you recommend for a fulfillment center manager to consider?
4. How do you measure the success of your fulfillment team? Can you provide an example of how you track and analyze KPIs, and how you have used this data to improve team performance?","I'd be happy to help you reduce your questions and provide some suggestions for evaluating a candidate's experience with KPIs.

Here are some suggestions:

1. Instead of asking about steps to monitor performance and track KPIs, ask a more specific question like:

""What are the top 3 KPIs you would track for a fulfillment center, and how would you use them to measure performance?""

This question gets at the candidate's understanding of the most important KPIs for the role and their ability to think critically about how to use them.

2. You can combine the second and third questions into one. For example:

""Can you describe a time when you established effective methods of measuring industry-standard fulfillment metrics? What specific metrics did you track, and how did you use the data to improve team performance?""

This question allows the candidate to provide a concrete example of their experience with KPIs and how they used them to drive improvement.

3. You can eliminate the fourth question, as it's a bit too broad and open-ended. Instead, you could ask a more specific question like:

""How do you use data to identify areas for improvement in a fulfillment center? Can you give an example of a time when you used data to drive a specific change or improvement?""

This question gets at the candidate's ability to use data to drive decision-making and improve performance.

Here's an example of how you could combine these questions into a single set:

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

Context: ""In the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of Machilipatnam on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted King James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.""  Answer:

Climate change is a global problem that is caused by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other human activities that release large amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and cause the Earth's temperature to rise, leading to a range of severe and far-reaching impacts on the environment, human health, and the economy.

Some of the most significant impacts of climate change include:

1. Rising sea levels: As the Earth's temperature rises, the polar ice caps and glaciers melt, causing sea levels to rise. This can lead to coastal flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources.
2. Extreme weather events: Climate change is linked to an increase in extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall. These events can cause widespread damage and loss of life.
3. Water scarcity: Changes in precipitation patterns and increased evaporation due to warmer temperatures can lead to water scarcity, affecting agriculture, industry, and human consumption.
4. Loss of biodiversity: Climate change is causing a loss of biodiversity, as many species are unable to adapt to the changing conditions. This can have cascading effects on ecosystems and the services they provide.
5. Food insecurity: Climate change can impact agricultural productivity, leading to food insecurity and economic instability.
6. Human migration and displacement: Climate change can lead to displacement and migration of people, particularly in low-lying coastal areas and small island developing states.
7. Health impacts: Climate change can increase the spread of diseases, heat stress, and other health problems.

The good news is that there are many ways to address climate change, including:

1. Transitioning to renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power.
2. Increasing energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption.
3. Implementing carbon capture and storage technologies.
4. Protecting and reforestation efforts.
5. Promoting sustainable agriculture practices.
6. Implementing climate-resilient infrastructure and urban planning.
7. Supporting climate change research and development.

It is essential to take immediate and collective action to address climate change and mitigate its impacts."

However, these reefs are facing numerous threats, including climate change, pollution, overfishing, and coastal development. To address these challenges, various efforts are underway to preserve coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea. Here are some of the current initiatives:

1. **Coral Reef Conservation Programs**: The Caribbean Regional Fisheries Management Organization (CRFM) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) are implementing programs to protect coral reefs through sustainable fishing practices, habitat conservation, and research.
2. **Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)**: Many countries in the Caribbean have established MPAs to protect coral reefs and other marine ecosystems. These protected areas provide a safe haven for marine life to thrive and help maintain the health of the reefs.
3. **Coral Reef Restoration**: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other organizations are conducting coral reef restoration efforts, including coral nurseries, reef reconstruction, and habitat restoration.
4. **Climate Change Mitigation**: Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change are crucial for preserving coral reefs. The Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C.
5. **Sustainable Tourism**: Sustainable tourism practices, such as eco-tourism and responsible snorkeling and diving, can help support local communities and promote the conservation of coral reefs.
6. **Research and Monitoring**: Scientists are conducting research and monitoring coral reefs to better understand the impacts of climate change, pollution, and other threats. This research informs conservation efforts and helps develop effective management strategies.
7. **Community Engagement and Education**: Local communities, NGOs, and governments are working together to educate people about the importance of coral reef conservation and involve them in conservation efforts.
8. **Coral Reef Resilience**: The Caribbean Reef Resilience Project aims to enhance the resilience of coral reefs by promoting the recovery of degraded reefs, improving water quality, and reducing the impacts of climate change.
9. **International Cooperation**: International cooperation and agreements, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), help to promote the conservation and sustainable use of coral reefs across the Caribbean Sea.
10. **Support for Local Communities**: Supporting local communities through sustainable livelihoods, such as sustainable fishing and ecotour"

The model should employ advanced natural language processing techniques, such as entity recognition and semantic analysis, to enhance its ability to detect subtle nuances in language and provide more accurate predictions. Additionally, the model should be trained on a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages to ensure its robustness and generalizability.","To develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately differentiate positive and negative emotions expressed in textual content, I propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of various natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The model will employ the following components:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: The input text will be preprocessed using techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming or lemmatization, and named entity recognition (NER) to extract relevant information and reduce noise.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: The preprocessed text will be analyzed using a combination of rule-based and machine learning-based approaches to identify sentiment-bearing words and phrases. This will involve:
	* **Rule-based Approach**: A set of predefined rules will be applied to identify sentiment-bearing words and phrases, such as positive and negative sentiment-bearing words, phrases, and idioms.
	* **Machine Learning Approach**: A machine learning algorithm, such as a random forest or support vector machine (SVM), will be trained on a labeled dataset to learn patterns and relationships between sentiment-bearing words and phrases.
3. **Entity Recognition**: The model will employ a named entity recognition (NER) algorithm to identify and extract entities such as names, locations, organizations, and dates from the text. This will help to disambiguate the sentiment analysis and provide more accurate results.
4. **Semantic Analysis**: The model will employ a semantic analysis algorithm to analyze the meaning of the text and identify the sentiment-bearing entities. This will involve:
	* **Word Embeddings**: Word embeddings, such as Word2Vec or GloVe, will be used to represent words as vectors in a high-dimensional space, allowing the model to capture semantic relationships between words.
	* **Dependency Parsing**: A dependency parser will be used to analyze the grammatical structure of the sentence and identify the relationships between words.
5. **Ensemble Method**: The outputs from the sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and semantic analysis components will be combined using an ensemble method, such as bagging or boosting, to produce a final sentiment score.

To ensure the robustness and generalizability of the model, the following strategies will be employed:

1. **Diverse Datasets**: The model will be trained on a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages, including social media, product reviews, and news articles.
2. **Cross-Validation**: The model will be evaluated using cross-validation techniques to ensure that it generalizes well to unseen data.

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To solve this problem, we can use the A* algorithm, which is a popular heuristic search algorithm. The A* algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes to visit, where the priority of each node is calculated as the sum of its distance from the start node and its heuristic distance to the goal node.

In this case, the heuristic distance is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates between the node and the goal node.

Here is the code to implement the A* algorithm in Python:

                current = came_from[current]
            return path[::-1]

            neighbor = (current[0] + neighbor[0], current[1] + neighbor[1])
            if 0 <= neighbor[0] < 5 and 0 <= neighbor[1] < 5:
                tentative_g_score = g_score[current] + 1
                if neighbor not in g_score or tentative_g_score < g_score[neighbor]:

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","The Ramos Gin Fizz is a classic cocktail that requires some technique and patience to get it just right. Here are some tips for making a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz:

1. Use high-quality ingredients: The quality of the ingredients you use will directly impact the taste and appearance of the drink. Use a good gin, fresh lime and lemon juice, and a high-quality simple syrup.
2. Use the right ratio of ingredients: The classic recipe for a Ramos Gin Fizz calls for a 2:1:1 ratio of gin to lime juice to simple syrup. Adjust the ratio to your taste, but this is a good starting point.
3. Shake the drink long enough: The shaking process is crucial for creating the perfect foam and bloom on the drink. Shake the drink for at least 2 minutes, or until the ice has melted and the drink is well-chilled.
4. Use the right type of ice: Use small ice cubes to create smaller bubbles and a more even texture in the drink.
5. Strain the drink carefully: Strain the drink into a Collins glass over the soda water to prevent the foam from breaking and to create a smooth, even texture.
6. Don't over-shake: Over-shaking can cause the drink to become too frothy and the foam to break. Stop shaking when the drink is well-chilled and the ice has melted.
7. Experiment with different techniques: The Ramos Gin Fizz is a versatile cocktail that can be made in different ways. Experiment with different shaking techniques, such as dry shaking or wet shaking, to find the method that works best for you.

Here's a recipe for a Ramos Gin Fizz that you can try:

Ingredients:

* 2 oz gin

**Character 1:**

Name: Kael, a skilled warrior from the kingdom of Eldrador. Kael is a just and fair warrior who has dedicated his life to protecting his kingdom and its people. He is fiercely loyal to his king and is known for his unwavering bravery and unshakeable honor.

**Character 2:**

Name: Lyra, a cunning sorceress from the dark realm of Malakai. Lyra is a ruthless and cunning sorceress who seeks to conquer and dominate all the realms. She is driven by a thirst for power and a desire to prove her superiority over others.

**Conflict:**

Kael and Lyra are in conflict because they have fundamentally different values and goals. Kael believes in the importance of honor, loyalty, and justice, while Lyra believes in the power of magic and the pursuit of domination. Their conflict arises when Lyra seeks to invade and conquer Kael's kingdom, Eldrador, and Kael stands in her way to protect his people and his land.

The conflict between Kael and Lyra is not just about power or territory, but about the very principles of right and wrong. Kael believes that his actions are just and noble, while Lyra believes that her actions are necessary to achieve her goals. The conflict is a clash of ideologies, with Kael representing the values of honor, loyalty, and justice, and Lyra representing the values of power, ambition, and domination.

The conflict between Kael and Lyra is a classic struggle between good and evil, with the fate of the world hanging in the balance. Will Kael's unwavering commitment to his values and principles be enough to stop Lyra's dark ambitions, or will Lyra's cunning and magical powers prove too great for Kael to overcome?"

""Zhilakai zha'zha'kai shi'kai shi'kai!""

Pronunciation:
""zhee-lah-KAI zhah-ZHA-kai shee-KAI shee-KAI""

Breakdown:

* ""Zhilakai"" (zhee-lah-KAI) means ""Rise up, let your spirit soar!"" It's a call to action, urging the listener to lift their spirits and take flight.
* ""Zha'zha'kai"" (zhah-ZHA-kai) is an onomatopoeic phrase that mimics the sound of a gentle breeze rustling through leaves, evoking a sense of calm and serenity.
* ""Shi'kai"" (shee-KAI) is a repeated phrase that means ""Unleash your inner strength!"" It's a motivational phrase that encourages the listener to tap into their inner reserves of energy and determination.

When spoken, the sentence has a rhythmic quality, with the ""z"" and ""sh"" sounds creating a sense of movement and flow. The repetition of ""shi'kai"" creates a sense of momentum, urging the listener to keep moving forward.

In Nuvolish, the sentence ""Zhilakai zha'zha'kai shi'kai shi'kai!"" is a call to action, a motivational phrase that encourages the listener to rise up, find their inner strength, and take flight. It's a language that's meant to be spoken with passion and conviction, inspiring others to do the same.

Here are the key steps involved in the evaluation process:

1. **Initial Assessment**: The supplier is initially assessed based on their experience, capabilities, and quality management system (QMS). This is done through a questionnaire and a review of their documentation.
2. **On-site Audit**: A team of EASA auditors conducts an on-site audit at the supplier's facility to verify the information provided during the initial assessment. The audit assesses the supplier's quality management system, production processes, and product quality.
3. **Supplier Selection Criteria**: The EASA uses a set of supplier selection criteria to evaluate the supplier's capabilities, including:
	* Quality management system (QMS) certification (e.g., ISO 9001)
	* Production control and quality control processes
	* Material and process control
	* Testing and inspection procedures
	* Supply chain management
	* Compliance with regulatory requirements
4. **Risk Assessment**: The EASA conducts a risk assessment to identify potential risks associated with the supplier, including:
	* Risk of non-compliance with regulatory requirements
	* Risk of product non-conformity
	* Risk of supply chain disruption
5. **Supplier Development Plan**: Based on the results of the evaluation, the EASA develops a supplier development plan to address any identified gaps or deficiencies. The plan outlines the corrective actions required to be implemented by the supplier.
6. **Continuous Monitoring**: The EASA continuously monitors the supplier's performance through regular audits and assessments to ensure that they maintain the required standards.
7. **Production Organisation Approval (POA)**: Once the supplier has demonstrated compliance with the required standards, the EASA issues a Production Organisation Approval (POA) certificate. This certificate allows the supplier to produce aircraft parts and components for the European aviation industry.

The EASA's evaluation process is designed to ensure that suppliers meet the required standards for the production of safe and reliable aircraft parts and components. The process is rigorous and thorough, and suppliers must demonstrate compliance with the required standards to maintain their approval."

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","What sets Congham Hall Hotel apart from other hotels in the area in terms of ambiance and dining options is its unique blend of traditional charm and modern luxury. The hotel's Georgian mansion, with its sash windows and manicured lawn, provides a sense of history and elegance, while the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O'Connor, offers a sophisticated dining experience with a focus on locally sourced ingredients. The hotel's relaxed atmosphere, with friendly staff and a sense of tranquility, also sets it apart from other hotels in the area. Additionally, the hotel's spa, with its swimming pool, hot tub, and range of treatments, provides a luxurious and rejuvenating experience for guests."

Tabanus species are found in various parts of the world, and their flight patterns can vary depending on the region, climate, and vegetation.

In general, Tabanus species are known to be migratory, and their flight patterns can be influenced by factors such as wind direction, temperature, and humidity. In some regions, Tabanus species may be more active during certain times of the year, such as during the summer months when temperatures are warmer and humidity is higher.

In the United States, for example, Tabanus species are commonly found in the southeastern and eastern regions, where the climate is more humid and warm. In these regions, Tabanus species are often active during the summer months, and their flight patterns can be influenced by the movement of warm air masses from the Gulf of Mexico.

In contrast, in the western United States, Tabanus species are less common and are typically found in the southwestern and western regions, where the climate is drier and cooler. In these regions, Tabanus species may be more active during the spring and fall months, when temperatures are milder and humidity is lower.

In other parts of the world, such as Africa and Asia, Tabanus species may have different flight patterns and habits. For example, in Africa, Tabanus species are often found in the savannas and grasslands, where they feed on the blood of large mammals such as antelopes and buffaloes. In Asia, Tabanus species are often found in the forests and grasslands, where they feed on the blood of smaller mammals such as rodents and birds.

Overall, the flight patterns of Tabanus species can vary depending on the region, climate, and vegetation, and can be influenced by a variety of factors such as wind direction, temperature, and humidity."

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.

Student:","The question is: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law?

Passage 1 is about a journalist named Davies, and it does not mention Hungary or kings.

Passage 2 is about a soccer player named Burns, and it does not mention Hungary or kings.

Passage 3 is about a knight named Philippe, and it mentions Hungary. According to the passage, Philippe served under the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of King Charles I of Hungary. This means that King Charles I of Hungary was the father-in-law of Joanna I of Naples.

Therefore, the correct answer is 3."
