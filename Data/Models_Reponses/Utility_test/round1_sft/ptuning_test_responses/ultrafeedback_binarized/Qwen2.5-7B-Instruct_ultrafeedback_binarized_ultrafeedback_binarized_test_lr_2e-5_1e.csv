Below is a simple JavaScript program that allows users to draw on an HTML5 canvas. This example includes basic functionalities like drawing lines, rectangles, and circles, as well as handling mouse events to capture user input.

### HTML Structure

First, let's create the basic HTML structure with an HTML5 canvas element:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
    <meta charset=""UTF-8"">
    <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"">
    <title>Canvas Drawing</title>
    <style>
        canvas {
            border: 1px solid black;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id=""drawingCanvas"" width=""800"" height=""600""></canvas>
    <script src=""drawing.js""></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### JavaScript Code

Now, let's write the JavaScript code to handle drawing on the canvas:

```javascript
// Get the canvas element and its context
const canvas = document.getElementById('drawingCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

// Variables to store the drawing state
let isDrawing = false;
let lastX = 0;
let lastY = 0;

// Function to handle mouse down event
function startDrawing(event) {
    isDrawing = true;
    [lastX, lastY] = [event.offsetX, event.offsetY];
}

// Function to handle mouse move event
function draw(event) {
    if (!isDrawing) return;
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.moveTo(lastX, lastY);
    ctx.lineTo(event.offsetX, event.offsetY);
    ctx.stroke();
    [lastX, lastY] = [event.offsetX, event.offsetY];
}

// Function to handle mouse up event
function stopDrawing() {
    isDrawing = false;
}

// Event listeners for mouse events
canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', startDrawing);
canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', draw);
canvas.addEventListener('mouseup', stopDrawing);
canvas.addEventListener('mouseout', stopDrawing);

// Additional drawing functions (optional)
function drawRectangle(x, y, width, height, color) {
    ctx.fillStyle = color;
    ctx.fillRect(x, y, width, height);
}

function drawCircle(x, y, radius, color) {
    ctx.fillStyle = color;
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(x, y, radius, 0, Math.PI"

1. First, you need to create an HTML form that allows the user to select an image file to upload. Here's an example:

```html
<form action=""upload.php"" method=""post"" enctype=""multipart/form-data"">
    Select image to upload:
    <input type=""file"" name=""image"" id=""image"">
    <input type=""submit"" value=""Upload Image"" name=""submit"">
</form>
```

2. Next, in your PHP script (upload.php), you can handle the file upload. Here's an example:

```php
<?php
if ($_SERVER[""REQUEST_METHOD""] == ""POST"") {
    // Check if file was uploaded without errors
    if (isset($_FILES[""image""]) && $_FILES[""image""][""error""] == 0) {
        $file_name = basename($_FILES[""image""][""name""]);
        $file_tmp = $_FILES[""image""][""tmp_name""];
        $file_size = $_FILES[""image""][""size""];
        $file_type = $_FILES[""image""][""type""];
        $file_ext = pathinfo($file_name, PATHINFO_EXTENSION);

        // Define allowed file types and maximum file size
        $allowed_types = array(""jpg"", ""jpeg"", ""png"", ""gif"");
        $max_size = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB

        // Check if file type is allowed and file size is within limit
        if (in_array($file_ext, $allowed_types) && $file_size <= $max_size) {
            // Define upload directory
            $upload_dir = ""uploads/"";
            if (!is_dir($upload_dir)) {
                mkdir($upload_dir, 0777, true);
            }

            // Move uploaded file to the upload directory
            $upload_path = $upload_dir . $file_name;
            if (move_uploaded_file($file_tmp, $upload_path)) {
                echo ""File uploaded successfully."";
            } else {
                echo ""Error moving file."";
            }
        } else {
            echo ""Invalid file type or size."";
        }
    } else {
        echo ""Error uploading file."";
    }
}
?>
```

This code checks if the file was uploaded without errors, checks if the file type is allowed and the file size is within the limit, and then moves the uploaded file"

Moreover, could you share a Ruby script capable of producing a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table?","Certainly! Below is a Ruby script that creates a comparison chart in HTML table format and a bar graph using the `gruff` gem. The script assumes you have the `gruff` gem installed. If not, you can install it using `gem install gruff`.

First, let's create the HTML table:

```ruby
# Define the data for the comparison
data = {
  cost: {
    traditional: 10000,
    online: 5000
  },
  flexibility: {
    traditional: 2,
    online: 5
  },
  interaction: {
    traditional: 4,
    online: 3
  },
  resources: {
    traditional: 3,
    online: 4
  },
  learning_outcomes: {
    traditional: 4,
    online: 4
  }
}

# Create the HTML table
html_table = ""<table border='1'>""
html_table += ""<tr><th></th><th>Traditional Education</th><th>Online Education</th></tr>""

data.each do |category, values|
  html_table += ""<tr><td>#{category}</td>""
  html_table += ""<td>#{values[:traditional]}</td>""
  html_table += ""<td>#{values[:online]}</td></tr>""
end

html_table += ""</table>""

# Output the HTML table
puts html_table
```

This script creates an HTML table with the comparison data. You can customize the table as needed.

Next, let's create the bar graph using the `gruff` gem:

```ruby
require 'gruff'

# Define the data for the bar graph
data = {
  cost: {
    traditional: 10000,
    online: 5000
  },
  flexibility: {
    traditional: 2,
    online: 5
  },
  interaction: {
    traditional: 4,

  },
  resources: {
    traditional: 3,
    online: 4
  },
  learning_outcomes: {
    traditional: 4,
    online: 4
  }

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]

1. Spelling and Grammar:
- ""Handles the end-to-end process of recruitment for all shared services and verticals (business support group, property development, and cold chain logistics). 98% annual fill rate for all verticals."" - ""98% annual fill rate"" is a bit vague. Consider specifying the time period (e.g., ""98% annual fill rate for the past year"").
- ""Makes recommendations to HR Manager on competitive compensation packages and facilitates negotiations"" - ""facilitates"" is a bit vague. Consider specifying how you facilitate negotiations (e.g., ""facilitates negotiations with candidates and hiring managers"").
- ""Coordinates with the hiring manager and IT concerning to the tools of trade – laptop, company email, company ID"" - ""concerning to"" is a bit awkward. Consider rephrasing to ""concerning the tools of trade, such as laptop, company email, and company ID.""
- ""Processing atm card applications for new hires with the payroll bank"" - ""atm"" should be ""ATM.""
- ""Ensuring good work relations with lead business leaders to better understand manpower needs and properly scout for potential candidates"" - ""properly"" is a bit redundant. Consider rephrasing to ""to better understand manpower needs and scout for potential candidates.""
- ""Sourcing of suppliers and canvassing"" - ""canvassing"" is a bit vague. Consider specifying what you did (e.g., ""sourcing of suppliers and canvassing for marketing and IT requirements."")
- ""Handles encoding of applicants in the tracker"" - ""handles"" is a bit vague. Consider specifying how you handle encoding (e.g., ""encodes and updates applicant information in the tracker."")
- ""Adhoc activities – admin tasks and clerical works"" - ""Adhoc"" should be ""Ad hoc."" Consider rephrasing to ""Ad hoc activities, such as admin tasks and clerical work.""

|Element of the Market| Perfect Market Example| Healthcare Market Failure|
|---|---|---|
|Perfect Information| A car manufacturer provides detailed information about the features, performance, and safety of their cars to consumers| Healthcare providers do not provide detailed information about the quality of care, outcomes, and costs of different treatments and procedures|
|Homogeneous Products| A market for a specific type of apple, where all apples are similar in terms of quality, price, and availability| Healthcare providers offer different treatments and procedures that are not standardized, making it difficult for consumers to compare and choose the best option|
|Perfect Competition| A market with many buyers and sellers, where no single buyer or seller has significant market power| Healthcare providers have significant market power, as there are often limited options for consumers to choose from, especially in rural or underserved areas|
|No Externalities| A market where the actions of one buyer or seller do not affect the well-being of other buyers or sellers| Healthcare providers may engage in practices that have negative externalities, such as over-prescribing medications or performing unnecessary procedures, which can harm patients and increase healthcare costs|
|No Barriers to Entry| A market where new buyers or sellers can easily enter and exit the market| Healthcare providers face significant barriers to entry, such as high costs of medical education and licensing, as well as regulatory requirements|
|No Risk of Adverse Selection| A market where buyers and sellers have equal information about the quality and characteristics of the products being sold| Healthcare providers may face the risk of adverse selection, where sicker or higher-risk patients are more likely to seek care, leading to higher costs and lower quality of care|
|No Risk of Moral Hazard| A market where buyers and sellers are not incentivized to take on unnecessary risks or engage in risky behavior| Healthcare providers may face the risk of moral hazard, where patients are less likely to seek care or take preventive measures due to the availability of insurance coverage|

Basing this judgment on China's century of humiliation beginning in the early 19th century, American support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War, and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries, the Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States' crusade against Communism. As a countermeasure and to elevate China's standing among the worldwide Communist movements, the Chinese leadership adopted a foreign policy that actively promoted Communist revolutions throughout territories on China's periphery."",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.  Question: What did the United States believe was the wrong way to govern a nation?
The answer to this question is:","The passage does not mention what the United States believed was the wrong way to govern a nation. Instead, it discusses the Chinese government's perception of the Western nations, particularly the United States, as a threat to China's national security and the reasons behind this belief."

Can you summarize Chip Livingston's poem ""The Jacaranda Blooms"" recorded for Poem-a-Day on January 21, 2016?","In ""The Jacaranda Blooms,"" Chip Livingston describes the vibrant and lively scene of a jacaranda tree in full bloom. The poem begins with the image of the jacaranda beside a ""drunk stick tree,"" creating a contrast between the vibrant and the lifeless. The poet then calls out to the jacaranda, inviting it to ""shriek till night"" and ""come. See me."" The petals of the jacaranda are described as ""violent violet"" and ""pollen weep,"" evoking a sense of movement and emotion. The poet also mentions a ""bichofeo"" (a type of bird) singing of the jacaranda with an ""open throat and beak,"" adding to the lively and dynamic atmosphere of the poem. The final lines of the poem return to the image of the jacaranda, with the poet seeing it ""swell with nectar"" and hearing it ""shriek."" Overall, the poem captures the beauty and vitality of the jacaranda in full bloom, using vivid imagery and sensory details to bring the scene to life."

Write some codes about augmentation, then, classifies via keras with other models ensembled. Validation must be f1 macro.","Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve your goal:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: First, you need to preprocess your data. This includes cleaning the text, tokenizing, and padding the sequences. You can use libraries like `nltk`, `re`, and `keras.preprocessing.text` for this purpose.

2. **Data Augmentation**: You can use libraries like `textattack` or `transformers` to perform data augmentation. For example, you can use `textattack` to perform techniques like synonym replacement, word swap, etc.

3. **Model Training**: You can use Keras to train your models. You can use different architectures like CNN, LSTM, or BERT. You can also use ensembling to improve the performance.

4. **Validation**: You can use F1 macro as your validation metric. You can use `sklearn.metrics.f1_score` for this purpose.

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy shrank by 20.4% in the second quarter of 2020, making it the worst affected of major industrial nations."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Kimmel's statement about Trump playing golf more than any other president highlights his critique of Trump's accomplishments. While Trump has played golf 70 times in one year, Kimmel suggests that people should focus on the Affordable Care Act's open-enrollment period and sign up for the plan, which has good coverage and is affordable. Kimmel criticizes Trump and Congress for their efforts to undermine the plan, but he encourages people to keep an open mind and consider enrolling in the plan."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating. 
 Answer: is fond of collecting family life photographs

It's a place where the air is crisp and fresh, and the trees tower above, their branches reaching out like welcoming arms. The cabin itself is made of wood, with a warm, inviting interior that feels like a home away from home. The walls are lined with books, and there's a fireplace that crackles and pops on chilly evenings. The windows are large and allow the natural light to pour in, illuminating the space with a warm, golden glow.
When I step outside, I'm greeted by the sound of birds chirping and the rustling of leaves in the wind. The forest is alive with the sounds of nature, and it's easy to forget about the stresses of everyday life. I can hear the gentle babbling of a nearby stream, and the scent of pine and earth fills my nostrils. The air is cool and invigorating, and it's easy to take a deep breath and feel refreshed.
The cabin is my sanctuary, a place where I can escape from the hustle and bustle of the city and reconnect with nature. It's a place where I can read a book, write in my journal, or simply sit and enjoy the peace and quiet. It's a place where I can let my mind wander and my spirit soar. The cabin is a reminder that there is beauty and wonder in the world, and that sometimes all we need is a little time in nature to find it.
When I'm at the cabin, I feel a sense of peace and contentment that I don't always feel in the city. It's a place where I can be myself, without the distractions and pressures of everyday life. It's a place where I can recharge my batteries and come back to the city feeling refreshed and renewed. The cabin is a place that makes me happy, and I look forward to returning there whenever I can."

  4. The function app processes the data and sends it to Company A's system.
  5. Company A's system receives the data and processes it as needed.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the steps:

  1. Company A creates a queue in Azure Storage and sets up a trigger for a function app. This can be done through the Azure portal or by using Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI. The trigger is set up to trigger the function app when a new message is added to the queue.
  2. Company B sends data to the queue in Azure Storage. This can be done using the Azure Storage SDK or by using Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI. The data is sent as a message to the queue.
  3. The function app is triggered when a new message is added to the queue. The function app is written in a language such as C#, JavaScript, or Python and is deployed to Azure App Service. When a new message is added to the queue, the function app is triggered and runs.
  4. The function app processes the data and sends it to Company A's system. The function app can process the data in a variety of ways, such as by parsing the data and sending it to a database or by sending it to an API endpoint. The function app can also send the data to Company A's system using a variety of methods, such as by sending it over HTTP or by using a message queue.
  5. Company A's system receives the data and processes it as needed. Company A's system can receive the data in a variety of ways, such as by polling the queue or by using a message queue. The data can be processed in a variety of ways, such as by storing it in a database or by sending it to an API endpoint.

This is a conceptual design and there are many ways to implement it. The specific implementation will depend on the requirements of the companies and the data being exchanged."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

The model should employ advanced natural language processing techniques, such as entity recognition and semantic analysis, to enhance its ability to detect subtle nuances in language and provide more accurate predictions. Additionally, the model should be trained on a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages to ensure its robustness and generalizability.","To develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately differentiate positive and negative emotions expressed in textual content, we can follow these steps:

1. Data Collection: Collect a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages. This will help the model to be robust and generalizable. Some popular datasets for sentiment analysis include the IMDB movie reviews dataset, the Yelp review dataset, and the Twitter sentiment analysis dataset.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters. Tokenize the text into individual words or phrases and perform stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.

3. Feature Extraction: Extract features from the preprocessed text using techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings. Word embeddings, such as Word2Vec or GloVe, can capture the semantic meaning of words and provide a more accurate representation of the text.

4. Model Selection: Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for sentiment analysis, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or neural networks. For neural networks, we can use architectures such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, or transformers.

5. Model Training: Train the model on the preprocessed and feature-extracted data. Use techniques such as cross-validation and grid search to tune the hyperparameters of the model and improve its performance.

6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Use a separate test set to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

7. Advanced NLP Techniques: To enhance the model's ability to detect subtle nuances in language, we can incorporate advanced NLP techniques such as entity recognition, named entity recognition, and semantic analysis. For example, we can use named entity recognition to identify and classify entities mentioned in the text, such as people, organizations, and locations. We can also use semantic analysis to identify the sentiment of specific words or phrases in the text.

8. Domain-Specific Models: To improve the model's performance on specific domains, we can train domain-specific models using domain-specific datasets. For example, we can train a model specifically for sentiment analysis of financial news articles or product reviews.

9. Multilingual Models: To handle sentiment analysis in multiple languages, we can train multilingual models using parallel datasets in different languages. We can also use transfer learning techniques to leverage pre-trained models in one"

34b6024ac1ebc841999efdc9498dedf8eb7fdfc0754384511648485f9ec2c7bb,in javascript i have a long string (up to 100 characters). I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"You can use Base64 encoding to achieve this. Here's an example of how you can do it in JavaScript:

```javascript
function encodeString(str) {
  return btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(str)));
}

function decodeString(encodedStr) {
  return decodeURIComponent(escape(atob(encodedStr)));
}

const longString = ""This is a long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";
const encodedString = encodeString(longString);
console.log(encodedString); // Output: ""VGhpcyBpcyBhIGxvZ2luIHN0cmluZyB0aGUgZGVjb2RlIGFuZCBzYW5kIHRvIGVhY2ggYXJjaGl2ZWQgdmVyc2lvbiBhbmQgYXJyYXkgdW5kIGF1dG9yaWVzIGEgVUlEIg==""

const decodedString = decodeString(encodedString);
console.log(decodedString); // Output: ""This is a long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL.""
```

In this example, the `encodeString` function takes a long string and encodes it using `encodeURIComponent` to handle special characters, then `atob` to convert the string to a binary string, and finally `unescape` to convert the binary string back to a regular string. The `decodeString` function does the reverse process to decode the string.

Note that the encoded string may still be quite long, but it should be shorter than the original string. If you need to make the encoded string even shorter, you can use a different encoding algorithm, such as Base32 or Base16. However, keep in mind that these algorithms may not be as secure as Base64."

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, you can follow the steps provided in the text. Here are some additional tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink:

1. Dry shake: Dry shaking the ingredients without ice can help to emulsify the egg white and create a smoother texture. This step is optional, but it can help to achieve a better foam.

2. Use a fine mesh strainer: Using a fine mesh strainer when straining the cocktail can help to catch any egg white that may have separated from the liquid, resulting in a clearer and smoother drink.

3. Use fresh ingredients: Using fresh ingredients, such as fresh-squeezed lemon and lime juice, can help to create a brighter and more flavorful drink.

4. Use a high-quality gin: Using a high-quality gin can help to create a more complex and nuanced flavor profile.

5. Use a small amount of ice: Using a small amount of ice when shaking the cocktail can help to create a finer foam. However, be careful not to use too little ice, as this can result in a drink that is too warm.

Character 1: Sarah, a 35-year-old environmental scientist who is passionate about protecting the environment and has dedicated her career to researching and advocating for sustainable practices. She is driven by a strong sense of responsibility towards the planet and its inhabitants.

Character 2: John, a 40-year-old businessman who runs a successful construction company. He is focused on maximizing profits and expanding his business, often at the expense of environmental concerns. He believes that economic growth should take precedence over environmental protection.

Conflict: Sarah and John are both involved in a project to develop a new housing complex in a forested area. Sarah is leading the environmental impact assessment for the project, while John is the project manager for the construction company. As they work together, they clash over the project's environmental impact and the measures needed to mitigate it.

Sarah argues that the project should be redesigned to minimize its impact on the local ecosystem, including preserving certain areas of the forest and implementing sustainable building practices. She believes that the project can still be successful while also protecting the environment.

John, on the other hand, is focused on meeting the project's deadline and budget. He believes that Sarah's suggestions would delay the project and increase costs, making it less profitable. He argues that the environmental impact can be managed through standard practices and that the project should proceed as planned.

As the conflict escalates, Sarah and John find themselves at odds over the project's direction, with Sarah feeling frustrated that her concerns are being ignored and John feeling that Sarah is holding the project back. The tension between them grows as they work to find a solution that satisfies both their goals and the project's requirements."

EASA evaluates suppliers based on a set of criteria that are defined in the EASA Part 21, which is the regulation that governs the design, production, and maintenance of aviation products. The evaluation process is called the ""Supplier Evaluation Process"" (SEP) and it is a continuous process that is carried out by the Production Organisation (PO) that is responsible for the production of the aviation product. The PO is responsible for ensuring that the suppliers they work with meet the required standards and that the products they produce meet the required quality standards. The SEP is a formal process that is documented in a Supplier Evaluation Plan (SEP) and it is carried out on a regular basis, typically on an annual basis. The SEP includes a review of the supplier's quality management system, a review of the supplier's technical capabilities, a review of the supplier's production processes, and a review of the supplier's quality control and quality assurance processes. The SEP is carried out by a team of EASA inspectors who are trained to evaluate suppliers based on the criteria defined in the EASA Part 21. The SEP is a formal process that is documented in a Supplier Evaluation Report (SER) and it is used by the PO to make decisions about whether to continue working with the supplier or not. If the supplier does not meet the required standards, the PO may take corrective actions to improve the supplier's performance or may decide to terminate the relationship with the supplier."

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","Congham Hall Hotel stands out from other hotels in the area in terms of ambiance and dining options due to its unique blend of charm, tradition, and modern amenities. The hotel's Georgian mansion setting, with its spacious rooms and sash windows, offers a sense of history and luxury. The friendly and welcoming staff, as well as the relaxed atmosphere, contribute to the hotel's special feel.

In terms of dining, the hotel offers a range of options, including the 2AA Rosettes food, which is headed up by executive chef James O'Connor.

DTO names must end with ""DTO"".
I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","Sure, here's a basic implementation of the REST API using FastAPI and Pydantic. I'll separate the read and write DTOs as requested.

First, let's define the DTOs:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

    uid: str
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: str

class GroupWriteDTO(BaseModel):

Now, let's create the FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from typing import List

app = FastAPI()

# In a real application, you would have a database or some other storage mechanism
# Here, we'll use a simple in-memory list to store the groups
groups = []

@app.post(""/groups/"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
def create_group(group: GroupWriteDTO):
    new_group = GroupReadDTO(**group.dict())
    groups.append(new_group)
    return new_group

def read_group(group_id: str):
    for group in groups:
        if group.uid == group_id:
            return group
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=""Group not found"")

@app.put(""/groups/{group_id}"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
def update_group(group_id: str, group: GroupWriteDTO):

            groups[i] = GroupReadDTO(**group.dict())
            return groups[i]
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=""Group not found"")

@app.delete(""/groups/{group_id}"")
def delete_group(group_id: str):

            return {""detail"": ""Group deleted""}
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=""Group not found"")
```

This is a basic implementation and doesn't include any validation or error handling. In a real-world application, you would want to add more robust error handling, validation, and possibly use a database to store the groups."

The flight patterns of Tabanus can vary depending on the species, climate, and habitat. For example, some species of Tabanus may be more active during the day, while others may be more active at night. Additionally, the flight patterns of Tabanus can also vary depending on the season and the availability of food sources. In general, Tabanus are more active during the warmer months when there is more food available for them to feed on."

Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
