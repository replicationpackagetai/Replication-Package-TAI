Some popular options include:

1. Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum): This plant is known for its ability to remove formaldehyde, xylene, and toluene from the air.

2. Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata): This plant is effective at removing formaldehyde, xylene, and toluene from the air, and it can also help to increase humidity levels.

3. Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum wallisii): This plant is known for its ability to remove formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene from the air.

4. English Ivy (Hedera helix): This plant is effective at removing formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene from the air, and it can also help to reduce mold spores.

5. Aloe Vera (Aloe barbadensis): This plant is known for its ability to remove formaldehyde and benzene from the air, and it can also help to reduce mold spores.

To determine how many plants you need, consider the size of your closet office and the number of people who will be using it. As a general rule, one plant per 100 square feet of space is a good starting point. However, you may need to add more plants if the space is particularly large or if there are multiple people using the space.

It's also important to note that while plants can help to improve air quality, they are not a substitute for proper ventilation and air filtration. Make sure to maintain good air circulation in your closet office and consider using an air purifier to further improve air quality."

Moreover, could you share a Ruby script capable of producing a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table?","Certainly! Here's a Ruby script that creates an HTML table and a bar graph to compare traditional education and online education based on the aspects you mentioned:

```ruby
require 'gruff'

# Define the data for the table
data = [
  [""Aspect"", ""Traditional Education"", ""Online Education""],
  [""Cost"", ""$10,000 - $30,000 per year"", ""$500 - $1,500 per year""],
  [""Flexibility"", ""Less flexible"", ""Highly flexible""],
  [""Interaction"", ""Face-to-face interaction"", ""Online interaction""],
  [""Resources"", ""Physical resources"", ""Digital resources""],
  [""Learning Outcomes"", ""Varies by institution"", ""Varies by institution""]

# Create the HTML table
table = ""<table>""
data.each do |row|
  table += ""<tr>""

This script creates an HTML table with the data you provided and a bar graph using the Gruff gem. The bar graph compares the cost, flexibility, interaction, resources, and learning outcomes of traditional education and online education. The output is a combination of the HTML table and the bar graph image.

To run this script, you'll need to have Ruby and the Gruff gem installed. You can install the Gruff gem by running `gem install gruff` in your terminal. Then, save the script to a file (e.g., `comparison.rb`) and run it using `ruby comparison.rb`. The output will be displayed in your terminal"
79a82593ced7264d795f36ec5074789fd73e6c806a5b9518c59980f8cf38bc05,"Teacher: In this task you will be given a list, of lists, of integers. For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]
Student:","Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. First, we need to identify the odd numbers in each inner list.
2. Then, we multiply the odd numbers in each inner list.
3. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list, we output 0 for that list.

Let's start with the first inner list: [40, -36, 45, -47]
- Odd numbers: 45, -47
- Multiplication: 45 * -47 = -2115

Now, let's move on to the second inner list: [-7, 39, 4, 23]
- Odd numbers: -7, 39, 23
- Multiplication: -7 * 39 * 23 = -6279

We continue this process for all the inner lists:

1. [8, 3, 9, -5, 1] -> 3 * 9 * -5 * 1 = -135
2. [-3, 20, -14, -38] -> -3 * -14 * -38 = -1638
3. [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49] -> -49
4. [-19, 28, -39] -> -19 * -39 = 741
5. [43, 8] -> 43
6. [-44, -16, 29] -> 29
7. [-50, -5, 30, -49] -> -5 * -49 = 245
8. [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45] -> -11 * 3 * 27 * -45 = 3645
9. [23, -44, -39] -> 23 * -39 = -897
10. [10, 39, 39] -> 39 * 39 = 1521

So, the final output list is: [-2115, -6279, -1"

A body fat percentage of 16% is considered to be very low, and it can lead to a number of health problems. For example, a low body fat percentage can lead to a lack of energy, weakness, and fatigue. It can also lead to a decrease in muscle mass, which can make it more difficult to perform physical activities. Additionally, a low body fat percentage can lead to a decrease in bone density, which can increase the risk of osteoporosis. If a woman has a body fat percentage of 16% or lower, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider to determine the cause and to develop a plan to address the issue."

In Lua, you can also use the `table.find` function to check if a key exists in a table. Here's an example of how you can use the `table.find` function in Lua to check if a key exists in a table:

```lua
local table = { ""apple"", ""banana"", ""orange"" }
local key = ""banana""

if table.find(table, key) then
    print(""Key exists in the table"")
else
    print(""Key does not exist in the table"")
end
```

In this example, the `table.find` function is used to check if the key ""banana"" exists in the table. If the key exists, the program will print ""Key exists in the table"". If the key does not exist, the program will print ""Key does not exist in the table"".

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy shrank by 20.4% in the second quarter of 2020, making it the worst affected of major industrial nations, while Scotland's economy fell 19.4%, with all industries contracting, and the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland calls for ongoing support for businesses."
af2d3f64a2f1c1dc8193ed1a7f51bf522de6369ed031cec03d35dc2e6c6ae4fd,In python variety of regex do I need to escape a literal = symbol?,"Yes, in Python, you need to escape the `=` symbol with a backslash (`\`) when using it in a regular expression (regex) pattern. This is because `=` has a special meaning in regex, and you want to match the literal `=` character.

Here's an example:

```python
import re

pattern = r'\='
string = 'This is a test string with = symbol'

matches = re.findall(pattern, string)
print(matches)  # Output: ['=']
```

In this example, the backslash (`\`) is used to escape the `=` symbol, so that the regex engine matches the literal `=` character in the string.

Note that in some cases, you may not need to escape the `=` symbol, depending on the context and the regex pattern you are using. For example, if you are using `=` as a literal character in a character class, you don't need to escape it:

```python
import re

pattern = r'[=]'
string = 'This is a test string with = symbol'

matches = re.findall(pattern, string)
print(matches)  # Output: ['=', '=']
```

In this example, the `=` symbol is enclosed in square brackets (`[]`), which creates a character class. In a character class, the `=` symbol is treated as a literal character, so you don't need to escape it."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Sure, here's a paraphrased version of Kimmel's statement about Trump playing golf more than any other president and connecting it to his critique of Trump's accomplishments:

""Donald Trump has set a new record for playing golf more than any other president, with over 70 rounds in just one year. While some may argue that he hasn't accomplished much, Kimmel suggests that instead of criticizing, people should take action and sign up for the Affordable Care Act's open enrollment period. Trump's administration has been trying to undermine the plan, but enrollment has actually surged. Kimmel encourages viewers to keep an open mind and consider signing up for the new health care plan, which covers pre-existing conditions, has no lifetime caps, and is affordable for those making under $50,000."""

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

It's a place where I can escape the hustle and bustle of the city and immerse myself in the tranquility of nature. The cabin is surrounded by towering trees, their branches reaching out to the sky like giant arms, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of pine and earth. The sound of birds chirping and leaves rustling in the wind is a constant reminder of the beauty and serenity of the natural world.

Inside the cabin, the walls are lined with wooden shelves, each one filled with books, trinkets, and mementos from my travels. The fireplace crackles and pops, casting a warm glow over the room and filling the air with the comforting scent of wood smoke. The windows are large and tall, allowing me to gaze out at the forest and the endless expanse of green that surrounds me.

The cabin is my sanctuary, a place where I can find peace and solace from the stresses of everyday life. It's a place where I can sit by the fire, read a book, and simply be present in the moment. It's a place where I can forget about the world outside and focus on the beauty and wonder of the natural world. It's a place where I can find happiness and contentment, and I am grateful for every moment I spend there."

1. **Azure Storage Queues**: Azure Storage Queues is a reliable, highly scalable, and durable message queue service that can be used to decouple applications and services. It is designed to handle high volumes of messages and can be used to implement a variety of scenarios, including data exchange between two companies.

2. **Company A**: Company A has a system that generates data that needs to be shared with Company B. This system can be a web application, a desktop application, or any other type of application that can send data to Azure Storage Queues.

3. **Azure Storage Account**: Company A creates an Azure Storage Account and creates a queue named ""CompanyBQueue"". This queue will be used to store the data that needs to be shared with Company B.

4. **Company B**: Company B has a system that needs to receive the data generated by Company A. This system can be a web application, a desktop application, or any other type of application that can receive data from Azure Storage Queues.

5. **Azure Storage Account**: Company B creates an Azure Storage Account and creates a queue named ""CompanyAQueue"". This queue will be used to store the data that Company A sends to Company B.

6. **Data Exchange**: Company A sends data to the ""CompanyBQueue"" queue in the Azure Storage Account. Company B's system can then receive the data from the ""CompanyAQueue"" queue in the Azure Storage Account.

7. **Data Processing**: Company B's system can process the data received from the ""CompanyAQueue"" queue and perform any necessary actions, such as storing the data in a database or sending it to another system.

8. **Error Handling**: Azure Storage Queues provides built-in error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure that messages are processed reliably. If a message fails to be processed, it will be automatically retried until it is successfully processed or the maximum number of retries is reached.

9. **Security**: Azure Storage Queues can be secured using Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication, which provides a secure way to authenticate and authorize access to the queue. Additionally, Azure Storage Queues can be secured using Azure Key Vault, which provides a secure way to store and manage secrets and keys.

10. **Monitoring and Logging**: Azure Storage Queues provides built-in monitoring and logging capabilities, which can be used to track the status"

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:
****
[A]: sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period

Context: ""In the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of Machilipatnam on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted King James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.""  Answer:
****
[A]: high profits


[Q]: Question: ""Which disease does not cause more death than lower respiratory infections, TB or pertussis?""  Context: ""The top three single agent/disease killers are HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. While the number of deaths due to nearly every disease have decreased, deaths due to HIV/AIDS have increased fourfold. Childhood diseases include pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles and tetanus. Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory and diarrheal deaths. In 2012, approximately 3.1 million people have died due to lower respiratory infections, making it the number 4 leading cause of death in the world.""  Answer:
****
[A]: pertussis

The post processor is responsible for converting the toolpaths into a format that the CNC machine can interpret and execute.

The post processor takes the toolpaths generated by the CAD/CAM software and applies the necessary machine-specific commands and parameters to create a G-code program. This G-code program is then sent to the CNC machine, which uses it to control the movement of the cutting tool and the workpiece.

The post processor is an essential component of the CAD/CAM process, as it ensures that the toolpaths generated by the CAD/CAM software are compatible with the specific CNC machine being used. It also helps to optimize the toolpaths for the specific machine and material being used, and can help to reduce the amount of time and effort required to prepare the toolpaths for the CNC machine.

In summary, a CAD/CAM post processor is a software tool that translates the toolpaths generated by a CAD/CAM software into a specific machine code that can be understood by a CNC machine. It is an essential component of the CAD/CAM process, as it ensures that the toolpaths generated by the CAD/CAM software are compatible with the specific CNC machine being used and can help to optimize the toolpaths for the specific machine and material being used."

// Encode a string
const longString = ""This is a long string that needs to be encoded"";

// Decode the string

The `btoa()` function converts a string to a base64-encoded string, which can be used to create a short, shareable URL. The `atob()` function converts a base64-encoded string back to its original string.

Note that the `btoa()` and `atob()` functions only work with strings that contain only ASCII characters. If your string contains non-ASCII characters, you'll need to use a different encoding method, such as UTF-8."

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.

Character 1: Sarah, a 35-year-old successful businesswoman who is driven and ambitious. She is a single mother of two children and has a demanding job in the corporate world. Sarah is a hard worker and is always striving to be the best in everything she does.

Character 2: Tom, a 40-year-old artist who is passionate about his work and has a deep love for nature. He is a single father of two children and has a laid-back lifestyle. Tom is a free spirit who values creativity and self-expression.

Conflict: Sarah and Tom are neighbors and have been living in the same apartment complex for a few years. Sarah is a successful businesswoman who is always busy with work and rarely has time for social activities. Tom, on the other hand, is an artist who spends most of his time painting and exploring nature. He is a free spirit who values creativity and self-expression.

The conflict arises when Sarah decides to start a community garden in the common area of the apartment complex. She believes that the garden will bring the community together and provide a space for people to relax and enjoy nature. However, Tom is against the idea, as he believes that the garden will disrupt the natural beauty of the area and interfere with his ability to paint and explore nature.

Sarah and Tom clash over the issue, with Sarah arguing that the garden will benefit the community and Tom arguing that it will harm the natural beauty of the area. The conflict escalates when Sarah decides to go ahead with the garden without consulting Tom, and Tom becomes increasingly frustrated with Sarah's lack of consideration for his needs.

The conflict between Sarah and Tom highlights the clash between two different lifestyles and values. Sarah is a driven and ambitious businesswoman who values success and achievement, while Tom is a free spirit who values creativity and self-expression. The conflict between them is a reflection of the larger societal tension between the demands of modern life and the desire for a more natural and fulfilling way of living."

EASA, or the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, is a regulatory body that ensures the safety and quality of aviation products and services. When it comes to evaluating suppliers, EASA follows a structured process to ensure that the suppliers they work with meet the necessary standards and requirements.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the evaluation process:

1. Initial Assessment: EASA starts by reviewing the supplier's documentation, such as their quality management system, technical specifications, and other relevant information. This helps EASA understand the supplier's capabilities and ensure that they have the necessary resources to meet the required standards.

2. On-site Inspection: EASA conducts on-site inspections to verify the supplier's compliance with the relevant regulations and standards. During the inspection, EASA assesses the supplier's facilities, equipment, and processes to ensure that they meet the required standards.

3. Supplier Evaluation: EASA evaluates the supplier's performance based on the results of the on-site inspection and other relevant information. This evaluation includes assessing the supplier's quality management system, technical capabilities, and compliance with the relevant regulations and standards.

4. Certification: If the supplier meets the required standards and requirements, EASA will issue a certificate of approval. This certificate indicates that the supplier is authorized to provide products or services to EASA and its customers.

5. Ongoing Monitoring: EASA continues to monitor the supplier's performance and compliance with the relevant regulations and standards. This monitoring includes regular audits and inspections to ensure that the supplier continues to meet the required standards.

In summary, EASA evaluates suppliers by reviewing their documentation, conducting on-site inspections, evaluating their performance, and issuing a certificate of approval if they meet the required standards. EASA also monitors the supplier's performance and compliance with the relevant regulations and standards to ensure that they continue to meet the required standards."

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","Congham Hall Hotel stands out from other hotels in the area in terms of ambiance and dining options due to its unique charm and traditional atmosphere.

DTO names must end with ""DTO"".
I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","Sure, here's a basic implementation of a REST API to manage groups of users using FastAPI and Pydantic. This implementation includes separate DTOs for read and write operations.

First, let's define the DTOs:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from datetime import datetime

class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: int
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: datetime

class GroupWriteDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
```

Next, let's define the API endpoints:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from typing import List

app = FastAPI()

# In-memory storage for groups
groups = []

@app.post(""/groups/"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
def create_group(group: GroupWriteDTO):
    new_group = GroupReadDTO(**group.dict())
    groups.append(new_group)
    return new_group

@app.get(""/groups/"", response_model=List[GroupReadDTO])
def read_groups():
    return groups

@app.get(""/groups/{group_id}"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
def read_group(group_id: int):
    for group in groups:
        if group.uid == group_id:
            return group
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=""Group not found"")

This implementation provides the following endpoints:

- `POST /groups/`: Create a new group.
- `GET /groups/`: Retrieve a list of all groups.
- `GET /groups/{group_id}`: Retrieve a specific group by its ID.
- `PUT /groups/{group_id}`: Update a specific group by its ID.

In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts.

In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
