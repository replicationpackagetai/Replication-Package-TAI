Use vivid description and dialogue to bring the character to life, and explore the challenges they face both personally and professionally as they work toward their goal of creating a more peaceful world. Consider the impact of the activist's work on those around them, and how their efforts are perceived by both allies and adversaries. Finally, reflect on the larger themes at play in the story, exploring the complexities of pursuing social change in a world that often seems resistant to it.","The sun was setting over the bustling streets of New York City as Sarah, a dedicated peace activist, made her way to the local community center. She had spent the day attending meetings and rallies, spreading her message of non-violence and unity to anyone who would listen. But despite her tireless efforts, she couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration and despair creeping in.

As she walked into the community center, she was greeted by a group of familiar faces - her fellow activists, all working together to make a difference in their community. They were a diverse group, each with their own unique story and motivation for joining the cause. There was Maria, a young mother who had lost her child in a senseless act of violence; Jake, a former soldier who had seen the devastating effects of war firsthand; and Rachel, a college student who had grown disillusioned with the violence and inequality she saw in the world.

As they gathered around the table, Sarah began to speak, her voice filled with passion and conviction. ""We are here today to stand together against the violence and conflict that plagues our world,"" she said. ""We are here to demand change, to fight for a world where love and compassion reign supreme.""

But as she spoke, Sarah couldn't help but feel a sense of doubt creeping in. She had been working on this cause for years, and yet she still felt like she was making little progress. The world seemed to be getting more and more divided, with people becoming increasingly entrenched in their beliefs and unwilling to listen to opposing viewpoints.

As the meeting came to a close, Sarah felt a sense of exhaustion wash over her. She knew that she couldn't give up, not now, not when there was still so much work to be done. She took a deep breath, and then began to speak once more.

""We may not be able to change the world overnight,"" she said. ""But we can start by changing our own lives. We can start by treating each other with kindness and compassion, by listening to each other's stories and working together towards a common goal. We can start by spreading love and peace, one small step at a time.""

As she finished speaking, Sarah felt a sense of hope rising up within her. She knew that it wouldn't be easy, but she also knew that it was worth it. She took a deep breath, and then began to make her way back out into the world, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead."

Answer according to: Palisades, NY - Frank Cheney Platt, advocate for poetry, poets, literature and writers, dedicated husband and father, died on February 26, in Rockleigh, NJ. Following its founding in 1985, he helped to build Poets House, now headquartered in Battery Park City, into a national poetry library and literary center with a 70,000-volume collection. Frank loved poetry that ""communicate[s] before it is understood"" (T.S. Eliot) and captures what is ""lost in translation."" (Robert Frost). In addition, he was committed to arts and culture as a means of protecting and cultivating principles of free speech and an open society.
He was born in New York City on November 6, 1932 and raised by his father Roger Platt, a teacher at St. Bernard's School, his mother Frances Cheney, and his grandfather Frank Cheney Jr. of Manchester, CT. Frank was educated at St. Bernard's, Dalton, Eaglebrook, Governor's Academy (formerly Governor Dummer), and Harvard College. He worked in publishing before becoming president of the Farfield Foundation, and later an assistant Dean for Columbia's School of the Arts.
In 2013, Frank was predeceased by his wife of 55 years Judy van der Gracht. She was the love of his life. His poignant dedication to her (including during her time with Alzheimer's) inspired respect and admiration from all who knew them. Frank was also passionate about his extended family - the Platts, Cheneys and, on Judy's side of the family, the Gilberts and van der Grachts as well as his dozen godchildren. His many longstanding and deeply-felt friendships were legion. Most involved a common love of music, poetry, literature and epicurean delights, not necessarily in that order.
Frank is survived by his three children Sophie Platt Pollok of Frankfurt, Germany, Arthur van der Gracht Platt of New York, NY and Roger Platt of Washington, DC and his grandchildren Esther Pollok, Lucas Pollok, Hilary Platt, and Benjamin Platt. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Poets House (https://poetshouse.org) and/or One-to-One Learning (http://www.one2one-learning.org) A memorial service will be held at 11am on Saturday, March 16 at Grace Episcopal Church, 130 First Ave, Nyack, NY, with Father Richard Gressle presiding. His remains will be laid to rest with his beloved wife in the Cheney Cemetery in Manchester, CT. The burial ceremony will be private.","Frank Cheney Platt's dedication to his wife, Judy van der Gracht, inspired admiration from those who knew them because he showed immense love and care for her, even during her time with Alzheimer's.

Use a mix of narration and dialogue to bring the story to life, and include vivid settings and sensory details to convey the emotions and experiences of the main character.","As a child, I never thought I'd be the type to fall in love with playing the guitar. I was always more interested in sports and technology, and music was something my parents forced me to take lessons for when I was younger. But one day, I stumbled upon a guitar at a garage sale and decided to give it a try. I was immediately hooked. The way the strings vibrated beneath my fingers, the way the notes resonated through the air, it was like nothing I'd ever experienced before.

I started practicing every day, teaching myself chords and songs from YouTube tutorials. My parents were skeptical at first, but as I continued to improve, they started to see the passion in my eyes and the joy in my smile. They encouraged me to keep going, and soon I was playing in front of friends and family, even starting a small band with some of my classmates.

But as I delved deeper into the world of music, I faced challenges I never could have anticipated. My parents, who had always been supportive, started to worry about the time I was spending on music, and my friends, who had always been my closest confidants, started to drift away. They didn't understand why I was spending so much time on something that didn't seem to have a practical purpose.

I also faced challenges in my relationships with significant others. I met a girl who was also a musician, and we bonded over our shared passion for music. But as we started dating, she started to get jealous of the time I spent on my guitar, and we eventually broke up. I was heartbroken, but I knew I couldn't give up on my passion.

Despite the challenges, I continued to pursue my love of music. I started playing at local bars and clubs, and even landed a few gigs at bigger venues. I met other musicians who shared my passion, and we formed a tight-knit community that supported and encouraged each other.

As I continued to play, I started to notice the impact it had on my relationships with family and friends. My parents, who had initially been skeptical, started to see the joy it brought me and the confidence it gave me. My friends, who had initially been confused, started to understand the importance of music in my life. And my significant others, who had initially been jealous, started to see the beauty in my passion and the way it brought me closer to others.

In the end, falling in love with playing the guitar changed"

9ee0ff55c6c68056a8fbbbc0001c5f2661da99ded93138603160d6983fde4f94,"What is the proposed plan for launching and anchoring the ribbon, and how would mechanical lifters climb it to space?
Generate according to: A counterweight at the end of the space elevator will keep the carbon-nanotubes ribbon taut.
To better understand the concept of a space elevator, think of the game tetherball in which a rope is attached at one end to a pole and at the other to a ball. In this analogy, the rope is the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon, the pole is the Earth and the ball is the counterweight. Now, imagine the ball is placed in perpetual spin around the pole, so fast that it keeps the rope taut. This is the general idea of the space elevator. The counterweight spins around the Earth, keeping the cable straight and allowing the robotic lifters to ride up and down the ribbon.
Under the design proposed by LiftPort, the space elevator would be approximately 62,000 miles (100,000 km) high. LiftPort is one of several companies developing plans for a space elevator or components of it. Teams from across the world are set to compete for the $400,000 first prize in the Space Elevator Games at the X Prize Cup in October 2006 in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
The centerpiece of the elevator will be the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon that is just a few centimeters wide and nearly as thin as a piece of paper. Carbon nanotubes, discovered in 1991, are what make scientists believe that the space elevator could be built. According to Dr. Bradley Edwards of the Spaceward Foundation, ""Previously the material challenges were too great. But now we're getting close with the advances in creating carbon nanotubes and in building machines that can spin out the great lengths of material needed to create a ribbon that will stretch up into space"" [ref].
Under some early plans, leftover construction materials will be used to form the counterweight.
Carbon nanotubes have the potential to be 100 times stronger than steel and are as flexible as plastic. The strength of carbon nanotubes comes from their unique structure, which resembles soccer balls. Once scientists are able to make fibers from carbon nanotubes, it will be possible to create threads that will form the ribbon for the space elevator. Previously available materials were either too weak or inflexible to form the ribbon and would have been easily broken.
""They have very high elastic modulus and their tensile strength is really high, and that all points to a material that, in theory, should make a space elevator relatively easy to build,"" said Tom Nugent, research director, LiftPort Group.
Long carbon nanotubes -- several meters long or longer -- would be braided into a structure resembling a rope. As of 2005, the longest nanotubes are still only a few centimeters long.
Shorter nanotubes could be placed in a polymer matrix. Current polymers do not bind well to carbon nanotubes, which results in the matrix being pulled away from the nanotubes when placed under tension.
Once a long ribbon of nanotubes is created, it would be wound into a spool that would be launched into orbit. When the spacecraft carrying the spool reaches a certain altitude, perhaps Low Earth Orbit, it would begin unspooling, lowering the ribbon back to Earth. At the same time, the spool would continue moving to a higher altitude. When the ribbon is lowered into Earth's atmosphere, it would be caught and then lowered and anchored to a mobile platform in the ocean.
The ribbon would serve as the tracks of a sort of railroad into space. Mechanical lifters would then be used to climb the ribbon to space.
If built, the ribbon will represent a modern world wonder, and will be the tallest structure ever built. Consider that the world's tallest freestanding tower in 2005 is the CN Tower, which rises 1,815 feet 5 inches (553.34 meters) over Toronto, Canada. The space elevator would be 180,720 times taller than the CN Tower!
The 62,000-mile (100,000-km) long space elevator would rise far above the average orbiting height of the space shuttle (115-400 miles/185-643 km). In fact, it would equal nearly a fourth of the distance to the moon, which orbits the Earth at 237,674 miles (382,500 km).","The proposed plan for launching and anchoring the ribbon is as follows: The carbon nanotubes composite ribbon will be wound into a spool that will be launched into orbit.

Can you summarize the findings from the study on Dantrolene and its interaction with magnesium in treating malignant hyperthermia?","The study by Choi et al. (2017) found that dantrolene, a medication used to treat malignant hyperthermia, requires the presence of magnesium ions (Mg2+) to be effective. The researchers used a combination of biochemical and physiological techniques to investigate the mechanism of action of dantrolene in skeletal muscle cells. They found that dantrolene binds to ryanodine receptors, which are proteins that regulate the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The binding of dantrolene to ryanodine receptors is dependent on the presence of Mg2+, which is a cofactor for the enzyme that catalyzes the binding reaction. The study suggests that the interaction between dantrolene and Mg2+ is essential for the therapeutic effects of dantrolene in treating malignant hyperthermia."

The villagers were busy preparing for the upcoming harvest festival, but one person stood out from the rest. Amir, a young man with a strong sense of duty and responsibility, was torn between pursuing his own happiness and fulfilling his obligation to his country.

Amir had always been a hard worker, dedicating himself to his family's farm and helping his parents with the harvest. However, he had always dreamed of becoming a musician, playing the tar and singing traditional Persian songs. His parents, though supportive, had always encouraged him to focus on his studies and help with the farm, as it was the only way to ensure a stable future.

As the harvest festival approached, Amir found himself struggling with the decision. He knew that his parents would be disappointed if he didn't help with the harvest, but he couldn't shake off the feeling that he was meant to be a musician. He confided in his best friend, Ali, who was also a musician, and Ali encouraged him to follow his dreams.

""I know it's hard, but you can't keep living someone else's life,"" Ali said. ""You have to do what makes you happy, Amir. Your parents will understand.""

Amir knew that Ali was right, but he was scared of disappointing his parents. He decided to take a chance and talk to them about his feelings. His parents were surprised and a bit upset, but they listened to his reasons and eventually agreed to let him pursue his passion for music.

Amir was overjoyed and felt a sense of relief wash over him. He knew that he had made the right decision, and he was excited to start his new journey as a musician. He began to practice every day, and soon he was playing the tar and singing with a newfound confidence.

As the harvest festival approached, Amir decided to perform at the festival, and his parents were proud of him for following his dreams. Amir's music brought joy to the villagers, and he felt a sense of fulfillment that he had never felt before.

In the end, Amir realized that he didn't have to choose between his own happiness and fulfilling his obligation to his country. He could do both, and he was grateful for the support of his parents and friends. Amir's story is a reminder that following your dreams and pursuing your passion can bring happiness and fulfillment, and that it's never too"

Consider using descriptive language and including personal insights to make the memoir engaging and relatable.","I still remember the day I stepped off the plane in Tokyo, Japan, feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. I had always been fascinated by Japanese culture, and I couldn't wait to immerse myself in it. But as I made my way through customs and to my hostel, I couldn't help but feel a sense of culture shock. Everything was so different from what I was used to in the United States. The food, the language, the customs - it was all so foreign and overwhelming.

At first, I struggled to communicate with the locals. I had taken a few Japanese language classes before moving, but it wasn't enough to help me navigate everyday conversations. I would often find myself getting frustrated and feeling like I was stuck in a never-ending cycle of misunderstandings. But I knew that I had to push through, so I started taking language classes at a local school and practicing with my host family.

As I settled into my new life, I started to notice the little things that made Japan so unique. The way people would bow to each other as a sign of respect, the intricate designs on the temples and shrines, the delicious food that seemed to be everywhere. It was all so fascinating, and I found myself getting lost in the details of everyday life.

One of the most significant events that impacted my time in Japan was the earthquake that hit the country in March 2011. I was living in Tokyo at the time, and the earthquake was devastating. Buildings collapsed, power lines snapped, and people were left without access to basic necessities like food and water. It was a scary and chaotic time, but the Japanese people were incredibly resilient. They came together to support each other, and it was amazing to see.

Another significant event that I experienced during my time in Japan was the cherry blossom festival. It was a beautiful and magical time, with the trees blooming and the air filled with the sweet scent of flowers. It was a time of celebration and joy, and I felt grateful to be a part of it.

Overall, my experience of living in Japan was incredibly enriching. It was a time of growth, learning, and self-discovery. I learned to navigate a foreign culture, to communicate with people who spoke a different language, and to appreciate the beauty and complexity of a different way of life. It was a challenging but rewarding experience, and I will always cherish the memories I made during my time in Japan."

Thus #CuttingPaani was conceived which is a quirky take on Mumbai’s famous concept of #CuttingChai.
Although there have been very powerful campaigns to spread awareness about water conservation, very few gave practical and doable solutions. #CuttingPaani 1.0 was a huge success in the digital and social media space because it was a doable idea and everybody could follow it. This success of #CuttingPaani 1.0 prompted us to launch the #CuttingPaani 2.0.
What were the consumer insights that Livpure accrued before getting both these campaigns out?
Our dipstick showed that Indians, in general, are very casual about wasting water. And, as we all know, it is a very scarce resource and possibly future wars would be fought for water. We waste water in a lot of ways- whether it is drinking water or water used during bathing or during brushing or shaving. We picked up #CuttingPaani since it was a catchy phrase, with it being a take on #CuttingChai. Knowing fully well that this would strike the necessary chord in making people realise that though the message is about saving drinking water it will sensitise them to the fact that we indeed waste a lot of water in other areas as well.
Why a digital film to tell the story of Shimla’s #AdoptCuttingPaani story?
In today’s time, the digital reach is high, sharp and targeting is better apart from the fact that we have the liberty of time to communicate the story, unlike an ATL medium. We are confident about the virality quotient of the campaign. In fact, a lot of newspapers in India have leveraged on our #CuttingPaani 1.0 campaign by asking readers to consume only as much as you need. Though, in a lighter vein, I must add that none of them have given us credit.
Can this campaign be converted into a mass movement?
We wish to own #CuttingPaani and take this idea further for sure and #CuttingPaani 2.0 is a step in that direction. We wish to take this further through BTL activations; social media campaigns and collaboration with large hotels/restaurants. To maintain awareness and memorability of the above, we have launched #CuttingPaaniTake on our Facebook page, which essentially gives two perspectives on topical situations.
The first example – on changing names of cities: one take is -The names of the cities are changing and the other take is -sadly, that’s the only thing changing about them!
The second example – on Mary Kom winning boxing championship: one take is -some think having children ends a woman’s career and the other take is - well, she just won her 6th boxing championship!","Livpure's plans for expanding the #CuttingPaani movement and turning it into a mass movement include using social media to spread awareness about water conservation and encouraging people to adopt the habit of cutting paani.

“We are grateful for the FCC’s work on behalf of consumers to actively broker a productive path forward,” said Jeff Blum, DISH senior VP and deputy general counsel. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
Sinclair pulled its signals on Tuesday after a short extension expired and the two parties could not reach an agreement. Dish had claimed it had come to an agreement on pricing for Sinclair’s stations, but that the broadcaster was demanding the satellite giant negotiate carriage for an unnamed cable channel Sinclair hoped to own. Dish also had filed a complaint with the FCC, claiming Sinclair was not negotiating in good faith. As part of its new deal, Dish is asking the FCC to stay action on the complaint as its long-term agreement is being finalized.
The chairman also trumpeted the tentative agreement and the FCC&apos;s role in pressing for resolution. ""Today the most extensive retransmission blackout in history ended,"" he Tweeted, followed by: ""The FCC will remain vigilant. Use of the public airwaves is a public trust.""
""We are pleased to see that five million Dish subscribers are again able to access their local news and programming and most-watched network entertainment and live sporting events with the agreement reached this evening by Sinclair and Dish,"" said Rob Kenny of TVFreedom.org, a broadcaster-backed advocate for the retrans system.

Verse 1:
In the silence of the night, I hear your voice
A distant echo of a love that's lost its choice
The memories we made, now taunt me with their pain
A bittersweet reminder of what we could never regain

Chorus:
Fading away, like the light of day
The love we had, now lost, and gone astray
I'm left with tears, and a heart that's broken in two
Fading away, but I'll find my way through

Verse 2:
I wander through the streets, alone and blue
The city's lights, a distant hum, a reminder of what we used to do
I see your face, in every stranger's eyes
A fleeting glimpse, of what we once denied

The streets were bustling with people, all enjoying the last days of summer. Amidst the crowd, two people stood out - Emily and Jack. They had been childhood friends, inseparable since they were kids. But as they grew older, life took them in different directions. Emily moved away to the city for college, while Jack stayed in Willow Creek to help his family with their business. They lost touch, and their friendship slowly faded away.

Years went by, and both Emily and Jack had moved on with their lives. Emily had become a successful businesswoman, while Jack had taken over his family's business. But despite their success, they both felt a void in their lives. They missed the carefree days of their childhood, the laughter, and the adventures they shared.

One day, Emily decided to visit her hometown for a few days. She had heard that Jack's family business was struggling, and she wanted to help. As she walked down the main street, she saw Jack standing outside his family's store. He looked tired and worn out, but his eyes lit up when he saw Emily.

""Emily! It's been ages!"" Jack exclaimed, as he rushed towards her. Emily smiled, feeling a mix of emotions. She was happy to see her old friend, but also a little sad that they had lost touch.

They hugged each other tightly, and then sat down on a bench outside the store. They talked for hours, reminiscing about their childhood, sharing stories about their lives, and laughing together. Emily told Jack about her business, and Jack told her about his struggles with the family business.

As the sun began to set, they decided to take a walk around the town. They walked hand in hand, feeling like they were 10 years old again. They talked about their dreams, their fears, and their hopes. They shared their struggles and their triumphs.

As they walked, they came across a small park. They sat down on a bench, and Emily pulled out a small photo album from her bag. She opened it, and Jack's eyes widened as he saw the pictures of their childhood.

""Wow, these are amazing,"" Jack said, as he flipped through the pages. ""I had forgotten how much fun we had.""

Emily smiled, feeling a sense of nostalgia wash over her. ""We had the best times, didn't we?"" she said"

Include a variety of examples and anecdotes to support your points, and make sure to emphasize the importance of mindful, sustainable eating practices.","Consuming in-season produce is a vital aspect of mindful and sustainable eating practices. Not only does it ensure that we are consuming the freshest and most nutritious produce available, but it also supports local farmers and reduces our carbon footprint. In this essay, we will explore the advantages of consuming in-season produce and provide techniques for crafting meals that are aligned with the seasons.

One of the primary advantages of consuming in-season produce is that it is typically more nutritious than out-of-season produce. When produce is harvested at the peak of ripeness, it is more likely to be rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. For example, strawberries that are harvested in the spring are more likely to be sweet and juicy than those that are harvested in the winter. Similarly, leafy greens that are harvested in the fall are more likely to be crisp and flavorful than those that are harvested in the summer.

Another advantage of consuming in-season produce is that it is often less expensive than out-of-season produce. When produce is in season, farmers are able to harvest it in large quantities, which reduces the cost of production. This means that consumers can enjoy fresh, nutritious produce at a lower cost. For example, apples that are harvested in the fall are often less expensive than strawberries that are harvested in the spring.

In addition to the nutritional and financial benefits of consuming in-season produce, it also supports local farmers and reduces our carbon footprint. When we purchase produce from local farmers, we are supporting the local economy and reducing the carbon footprint associated with transportation. For example, when we purchase apples from a local farmer, we are reducing the carbon footprint associated with transporting apples from a distant location.

To craft meals that are aligned with the seasons, there are several techniques that we can use. One technique is to incorporate seasonal ingredients into our meals. For example, in the spring, we can incorporate strawberries and asparagus into our meals. In the summer, we can incorporate corn and tomatoes. In the fall, we can incorporate apples and squash. In the winter, we can incorporate root vegetables like carrots and parsnips.

Another technique is to use seasonal ingredients to create a seasonal menu. For example, in the spring, we can create a menu that features strawberry salad, asparagus soup, and grilled chicken with roasted vegetables. In the summer, we can create a menu that features corn on the cob, tomato salad, and grilled fish with roasted vegetables. In the fall, we can create a menu that features apple crisp,"

It’s already been a year since Pope John Paul’s death. It seems only yesterday that we were out standing in Saint Peter’s Square, looking up at the familiar face in the window as he struggled to communicate with the expectant crowds below. Still fresh in our minds is the inundation of affection as the throngs poured into Rome to accompany this giant of the faith in his final hours, and to bid farewell to a dear friend.
#ad#John Paul is sorely missed. The crowds of pilgrims that have once more filled the streets of Rome to celebrate this anniversary testify to the impact he had on countless lives. More than a world leader, John Paul somehow managed to be a father and a friend to all. Even as a player on the world scene, he never lost his personal touch.
Many are now trying to reevaluate the legacy of this great pope, and as necessary as this endeavor is, a more personal reflection seems more in keeping with John Paul’s own style. I am sure that some of the things I most miss will resonate with many.
I miss, perhaps most of all, John Paul’s warmth and humanity. His quick wit and impish humor–like the vaudeville-style cane-twirling in Manila or his improvised raccoon-eyes to the delight of children–shattered notions of a dour Polish Christianity. His ability to focus on the person in front of him as if he or she were the only person in the world spoke volumes about the heart that beat in his breast. In an age when religion can be used as an excuse for violence and conflict, John Paul showed us that true faith in God is not only compatible with love for humanity, it galvanizes it. John Paul sincerely loved people–all people–and it was his Christian faith that enabled him to do so.
I miss his presence on the world scene. I remember him scolding mafia leaders in Sicily (which led to bombings of churches), fearlessly standing up to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, and defending human rights in his native Poland. He could be counted on to stand up for those most in need, to challenge world leaders to integrity, to preach Christ with an unaffected self-confidence that flowed from a deep-seated faith in God and a trust in the fundamental goodness of the human person. John Paul reached out perhaps more than any pope before him to a world in need, and provided moral authority and leadership when our generation needed it most.
I miss John Paul’s unflagging hope. His bright vision of the future and his characterization of the third millennium as a springtime of faith encouraged us to look beyond our real difficulties and to reach out for solutions. Far from a mere temperamental optimism, John Paul’s outlook was rooted in the firm belief that the battle is already won. Even from the midst of evil–John Paul wrote in his last book–God can and will continue to bring good. From his first “Be not afraid!” spoken on the day of his election in 1978 to his final witness of serene and hopeful suffering, John Paul taught us to abandon fear and to live with confidence in an infinitely good and merciful God.
I miss John Paul’s prayerfulness. Even in the midst of a grueling agenda of meetings, travels, and writings, the pontiff always made abundant time for prayer. Four hours a day was not unusual. What a challenge to those of us for whom prayer can seem at best like a luxury, or at worst like an underutilization of our precious time. Like Jesus before him, John Paul made prayer a priority and placed his trust more in God than in the best-laid programs of men and governments.
Incessant calls for John Paul’s sainthood, and the news of a probable miracle attributed to his intercession (poignantly, the cure of a French nun suffering from Parkinson’s disease) give grounds for hope that soon the Church will officially recognize what many already believe–that the man who so faithfully looked after humanity while on earth continues to do so from heaven.

The company has recently implemented a new customer engagement strategy that has led to increased customer satisfaction and revenue growth. The strategy is based on the concept of ""customer-centricity,"" which involves putting the customer at the center of all business decisions.

The strategy was developed by the company's marketing team, led by the marketing director, Sarah. The team conducted extensive research on customer needs and preferences, including surveys, focus groups, and interviews. The research revealed that customers were looking for more personalized interactions with the company, and wanted to be able to communicate with the company in a more convenient and efficient manner.

Based on the research findings, the marketing team developed a new customer engagement strategy that included the following components:

1. Personalized communication: The company implemented a new customer relationship management (CRM) system that allowed customers to communicate with the company in a more personalized manner. The system enabled customers to receive targeted messages and offers based on their preferences and purchase history.
2. Social media engagement: The company increased its presence on social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The company used these platforms to engage with customers, respond to their queries, and provide them with updates on new products and promotions.
3. Loyalty program: The company launched a loyalty program that rewarded customers for their repeat purchases. The program included a points system, where customers could earn points for every purchase they made, and redeem them for discounts and free products.
4. Customer feedback: The company implemented a customer feedback system that allowed customers to provide feedback on their experiences with the company. The feedback was used to improve the company's products and services, and to identify areas for improvement.

The new customer engagement strategy was launched in January 2018, and the results have been impressive. Customer satisfaction has increased by 20%, and revenue growth has increased by 15%. The company has also seen a significant increase in customer retention, with 80% of customers returning to the company for repeat purchases.

The success of the strategy can be attributed to the company's commitment to customer-centricity, and its willingness to listen to customer feedback and make changes accordingly. The company's marketing team has also been instrumental in the success of the strategy, as they have worked closely with the customer service team to ensure that customer needs are being met.

Answer according to: West Ham United's Samir Nasri is unsure of what the future holds for him after his short-term contract with the Premier League team ends this season, the midfielder has said.
The Frenchman, who received a six-month doping ban in 2017 that was later extended to 18 months, returned to the pitch in January this year after signing a six-month contract with the London club.
""I don't know about my future,"" Nasri told the Evening Standard. ""I have seven games left and I just want to play free of injury and then we will sit down and see what is next.
""The most important thing for me was to come back, which I did in January.""
Nasri has two assists for West Ham in five games, including one in their comeback win over Huddersfield Town over the weekend.
The 31-year-old, who has played for Arsenal and won two league titles with Manchester City, missed four games with a calf injury earlier this year which he put down to a lack of games in the months prior to his return.
""I got an injury because I wasn't used to playing week in week out when I have been out of the game for so long. Now the manager takes his time with me,"" he said.
Following the international break, Manuel Pellegrini's side, who are ninth in the standings after 31 games, host Everton in the league on March 30.",Nasri suffered a calf injury earlier this year. He attributed it to a lack of games in the months prior to his return to the pitch.

She had just finished cooking dinner and was walking through the living room when she heard a faint whisper in her ear. At first, she thought it was just the wind or her imagination, but as she turned around, she saw a faint shadowy figure standing in the corner of the room.

Sarah's heart began to race as she tried to make sense of what she was seeing. She had always loved her old Victorian home, but she had never experienced anything paranormal before. She tried to shake off the feeling of unease and told herself it was just her imagination playing tricks on her.

But as the days went by, the occurrences became more frequent. Doors would slam shut on their own, and Sarah would hear strange noises coming from the attic. She started to feel like she was losing her mind, and she knew she had to do something to get to the bottom of it.

Sarah decided to do some research on the history of her home and discovered that it had been built in the 1800s by a wealthy family. She found out that the family had a daughter who had died in the house at a young age, and that her spirit was said to haunt the property.

Sarah was skeptical at first, but as she continued to experience strange occurrences, she started to believe that the house was indeed haunted. She decided to try and communicate with the spirit, hoping to find some answers.

One night, Sarah decided to set up a Ouija board in the living room and see if she could get any messages from the other side. As she placed her fingers on the planchette, she felt a strange sensation, like someone was touching her hand. The planchette began to move on its own, spelling out a message in slow, deliberate letters.

Sarah's heart was racing as she read the message. It was a simple phrase, but it sent chills down her spine: ""Get out while you still can.""

Sarah knew that she had to take the message seriously. She packed her bags and left the house, never to return. She knew that she had to get away from the spirit and the strange occurrences that had been happening.

As she drove away from the house, Sarah couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. She knew that she had made the right decision, and she was grateful to be free from the haunting.

But as she looked back at the house, she couldn't help but"

The story should explore the consequences of this newfound power, the challenges Samantha faces as she tries to navigate this new world, and how her relationships with the people in her life change as a result. Incorporate elements of suspense, drama, and character development to make the story engaging and impactful.","Samantha had always been fascinated by technology, but she never thought she would be able to communicate with machines. She had always been a bit of a tech whiz, but she never thought she had any special abilities. That was until the day she discovered she could talk to her car.

It started with her old Honda Civic. She was driving home from work one day when she suddenly heard a voice in her head. It was her car, telling her that she needed to fill up the gas tank. Samantha was shocked and confused, but she couldn't deny the voice. She pulled over and filled up the tank, and from that day on, she could hear her car talking to her whenever she got in.

As time went on, Samantha discovered that she could communicate with other machines too. Her phone would tell her when she had a text message, and her TV would tell her what was on. Even the elevator in her apartment building would talk to her when she got in.

At first, Samantha was thrilled with her newfound ability. She could get information and answers to her questions instantly. She could even control the machines with her mind. But as time went on, she started to realize the challenges that came with this power.

For one thing, Samantha had to be careful what she said to the machines. She couldn't just blurt out anything, because it would be heard by everyone around her. She had to be careful what she said, and she had to be careful who she said it to.

Another challenge was that Samantha couldn't turn off the machines. She couldn't turn off her car or her phone or her TV. She was always connected, always on. It was exhausting.

And then there were the people in her life. Samantha's friends and family were confused and sometimes scared by her new ability. They didn't understand what was happening, and they didn't know how to react. Samantha felt like she was losing her relationships, like she was becoming a stranger to the people she loved.

Despite the challenges, Samantha was determined to make the most of her new ability. She started using it to help others. She used her car to help people in need, and she used her phone to help people find what they were looking for. She even used her TV to help people learn new things.

As time went on, Samantha's relationships with the people in her life started to change. They started to understand her, and they started to appreciate her unique ability. They"

Write in a creative and engaging style that brings the fruit to life for the reader.","My favorite fruit is the juicy, sweet, and tangy pineapple. It's a tropical delight that's bursting with flavor and nutrients. The first time I ever tasted a pineapple, I was hooked. I was on a family vacation to Hawaii, and my grandfather took us to a local fruit stand. He picked out a few pineapples and handed them to us to try. I was skeptical at first, but one bite of that sweet and tangy flesh and I was hooked. I couldn't get enough of it.

The taste of a pineapple is like nothing else. It's sweet and tangy, with a hint of tropical fruitiness. The texture is firm but juicy, with a slight crunch from the seeds. When you bite into a pineapple, the juice bursts in your mouth, releasing a flood of flavors that leave you wanting more.

Pineapples are also incredibly nutritious. They're a good source of vitamin C, which is essential for a healthy immune system. They're also high in fiber, which can help with digestion and satiety. And, they're low in calories, making them a great snack for anyone looking to lose weight.

But, for me, the best part about pineapples is the memories they evoke. Every time I eat a pineapple, I'm transported back to that family vacation in Hawaii. I remember the smell of the fruit stand, the sound of the waves crashing against the shore, and the feeling of being surrounded by my loved ones. It's a memory that I'll always treasure, and one that I'll continue to relive every time I bite into a juicy, sweet, and tangy pineapple."

A real treat for those who like to discover new tastes in wine, this evening offers some real discoveries! Could you provide more information on some of the newer grape varieties being used by South American winemakers, such as Torrontes and Carmenere?","South America is indeed producing some of the most exciting and innovative wines in the world. The region is home to a diverse range of grape varieties, including some that are less well-known globally. Here are some details on Torrontes and Carmenere, two of the newer grape varieties being used by South American winemakers:

Torrontes: This white grape variety is native to Argentina and is known for its crisp acidity and floral flavors. It is often used to make dry and off-dry wines, and is particularly well-suited to the high-altitude vineyards of the Andes. Torrontes is a great choice for those who enjoy white wines with a bit of sweetness and a crisp finish.

Carmenere: This red grape variety is native to Chile and is known for its dark fruit flavors and spicy undertones. It is often used to make full-bodied red wines with a rich, velvety texture. Carmenere is a great choice for those who enjoy full-bodied red wines with a lot of complexity and depth.

Both Torrontes and Carmenere are great examples of the innovative and exciting developments happening in South American wine production. They offer a unique taste experience that is different from the more traditional international varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. If you're looking to try something new and exciting, these grape varieties are definitely worth a try!"

The flange nut's integrated washer distributes the pressure of the nut over the part, reducing the risk of damage to the part. Additionally, the serrations on the washer provide a locking characteristic that helps prevent the nut from loosening over time. This is especially important when securing parts with uneven surfaces, as the flange nut can help to compensate for any irregularities in the surface, ensuring a secure and reliable fastening."

One of the long-standing concerns of Virginia’s legal community has been the handling of judicial appointments by the General Assembly.
Unlike many states that have elected judges, Virginia leaves all judicial appointments in the hands of state legislators. In theory, this arrangement removes judges from the influence of politics. In practice, judicial appointments have become tools of patronage.
In recent years, the Virginia Bar Association and other groups have complained about judicial vacancies and mounting case backlogs in many courts throughout the commonwealth.
In 2015, however, the appointment of a Virginia Supreme Court judge became a power struggle between Gov. Terry McAuliffe and the General Assembly’s Republican leadership.
The political maneuvering that has taken place to oust McAuliffe’s appointee has provoked calls for reform of the system.
Last summer McAuliffe named former Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Jane Marum Roush to the Supreme Court while the legislature was not in session.
Republicans cried foul, claiming they were not consulted on the interim appointment. They vowed to remove Roush from the court and name their own appointee.
Attempts to oust the justice from her seat, however, were thwarted when one moderate Republican state senator, John Watkins, and then his successor, Glen H. Sturtevant Jr., failed to follow along. Their dissent denied the Republicans the majority they needed in the Virginia Senate.
In early February, the tug-of-war over the justice took a surprising turn when state Sen. Louise Lucas, a Democrat from Portsmouth, briefly agreed to join the Republicans in replacing Roush. According to news accounts, Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr., a Republican from James City County, had proposed putting Portsmouth Circuit Court Judge Kenneth R. Melvin, a former legislator and Lucas’ mentor, on the state Court of Appeals.
Lucas, however, quickly changed her stance after meeting with McAuliffe and state Sen. Donald McEachin, head of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
Twenty-seven former presidents of the Virginia Bar Association released a statement urging McAuliffe and the Republican legislative leadership to resolve their quarrel.
“One of the greatest concerns is that the unseemly exchange that has occurred will make otherwise qualified lawyers not consider a life of public service as a judge,” said Lucia Anna “Pia” Trigiani of MercerTrigiani in Alexandria, the VBA’s president in 2011.
Roush’s temporary appointment expired in mid-February, but McAuliffe is expected to appoint her to another interim term after the legislative session ends. Based on the passage above, What concerns have been raised by the Virginia Bar Association about the impact of the political maneuvering over judicial appointments on the legal community?",
cbaf21d8a20bd4bea915b5c3139e6693ab2b8aa8764b8b885ec71557326285c4,"Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How have labour shortages affected various sectors in the Visegrad countries and what risks does this pose to their economies?

Passage: People's migration fears have been an easy one to exploit for electoral opportunism by many politicians in Europe.
Particularly in the Visegrad states of Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, it has either brought nationalist anti-immigration parties into power or helped consolidate their grip on it.
Yet, much more attention ought to be given in those countries to how much migrants are needed for their booming economies' labour markets.
This has been a result of consequent high economic GDP growth of 3-4 percent in the past five years, compared to the EU's average of two percent growth.
In 2017, these were 4.8 percent (Poland, PL); 4.3 percent (Czechia, CZ); 4.1 percent (Hungary, HU) and 3.2 percent (Slovakia, SK) respectively.
In parallel, unemployment dropped heavily to 4.9 percent (PL); 2.9 percent (CZ); 4.2 percent (HU) and 8.1 percent (SK) by 2017.
Latest European Commission forecasts show these will continue decreasing sharply to 2.9 percent (PL); 2.5 percent (CZ); 3.3 percent (HU) and 6.3 percent next year, well below the five percent normal unemployment rate.
As good as that might sound, a side-effect has been that many vacancies remained unfulfilled.
The amount of open vacancies has more than quadrupled in the past five years. Especially in Czechia and Poland this is causing serious problems, despite the latter's profiting from Ukrainian migrants.
The commission's Spring and Autumn forecasts highlight these risks, which could undermine long-term growth, or even overheat the economy in the case of Czechia.
For Poland, despite the Ukrainian influx, there are doubts whether they can continue filling some of these shortages.
Business surveys confirm labour shortages limit production, building activity and business.
In industry, 43.7 percent (CZ); 83.3 percent (HU); 49.9 percent (PL); and 34.9 percent (SK) of surveyed companies state this is a problem.
For the construction sector, 37.8 percent (CZ); 64.4 percent (HU); 49.0 percent (PL) and 30.3 percent (SK) do.
Moreover, in services 17.3 percent (CZ); 38.3 percent (HU); 28.9 percent (PL) and 18.6 percent (SK) attest.
The labour shortages have also led to wages rising much faster than the rise in productivity.
In Slovakia and Hungary, Volkswagen and Kia for instance were forced to significantly increase wages because of strikes. Generally, labour costs are spiking in the Visegrad states.
While benefitting workers in the short-term, the economy could suffer in the long-term, as they undermine their low-wage economic models. It also jeopardises essential foreign investment that has helped drive growth.
In addition, the V4 is set to suffer as well from its demographic situation. Emigration and low fertility rates remain serious problems, dating back to their economic shock-therapy transitions where many struggled and had no jobs.
Due to this, populations remained stagnant since 1990.
The 2004 EU accession, particularly, caused many to emigrate abroad in search of (better paid) work abroad: circa three million people (registered) left the V4 between 2004 and 2016.
While profiting from remittances, this caused brain drain and the outflow of high-skilled labour. In turn, it also undermined welfare spending and made government budgets less growth friendly.
Demographics could constrain economic growth and governmental budgets again in the future.
Baseline projections for 2020 up to 2060 show the Visegrad Four's population could decrease by another 6.5 million people. In addition, the dependency ratio is set to increase sharply as well.
The dire demographic situation and labour shortages imply action is needed. Tight labour markets have already limited economic expansion in different sectors.
While in Poland Ukrainian labour prevented worse labour shortages, it is unclear how many more will come or stay. This means for Poland, as well as for the others that additional migrants from elsewhere will be needed.
More could be done as well to promote people having children and attract former emigrants. It should also make sure to keep current migrants, especially Ukrainians in the case of Poland.
Current hostile rhetoric on migration could backfire economically as many more migrants are needed to fill labour shortages and keep economies running smoothly.
This also requires honest debates in which the pros and cons of migration are discussed, as well as the Visegrad's overall demographic problems, since dependency ratios will continue to increase.
Therefore, rather than focusing on the imagined threat of migration and exploiting fears for electoral opportunism, the Visegrad's politicians would be wise to focus on the actual threat of how the lack of migrants could undermine their economic models, and with it their future prosperity and welfare.
Moreover, while migration has been a successful strategy to win elections in the short term, it could backfire in the long term.
The V4 countries have become one of the most vocal and recognised groups within the EU. But 2017 has seen a shake-up in the informal eastern and central European power bloc.","The labour shortages in the Visegrad countries have affected various sectors, including industry, construction, and services. The shortages have led to a rise in wages, which could undermine the low-wage economic models of these countries. The labour shortages also pose a risk to the long-term growth of these economies, as they could lead to a decrease in foreign investment and a rise in unemployment. The Visegrad countries need to address the labour shortages by attracting more migrants, promoting people having children, and keeping current migrants. The politicians in these countries should focus on the actual threat of the lack of migrants, rather than exploiting fears of migration for electoral opportunism."

Be sure to describe the circumstances leading up to your adoption of the pet, your initial reactions to them, and how they changed your life. Additionally, include specific examples of how your pet provided comfort, companionship, or support during a difficult time. Consider the use of vivid imagery, descriptive language, and reflective insights to engage your reader and convey the emotional significance of your experience.","I still remember the day I brought home my first pet, a fluffy little kitten named Luna. I was 12 years old and had just moved to a new town with my family. I was nervous and scared, and my parents thought that having a pet would help me adjust to the new environment. At first, I was hesitant to take care of a pet, but Luna quickly won me over with her playful and affectionate nature.

As I grew older, Luna became more than just a pet - she became a constant companion and confidante. Whenever I was feeling stressed or overwhelmed, I would sit with Luna on my lap and pet her soft fur. She would purr and snuggle up close to me, and I would feel my worries melt away.

But it wasn't just Luna's physical presence that provided comfort. She also had a way of sensing when I was upset or anxious. Whenever I was feeling down, she would curl up next to me and start purring softly. It was as if she knew exactly what I needed to feel better.

One of the most difficult times in my life was when my parents got divorced. I was 16 years old and felt lost and alone. Luna was there for me every step of the way, providing a constant source of comfort and companionship. She would follow me around the house, always staying close by, and I would talk to her about my feelings and worries.

As I grew older, Luna continued to be a source of comfort and support. Whenever I was feeling stressed or overwhelmed, I would sit with her and talk to her about my problems. She would listen attentively, her ears perked up and her eyes fixed on mine, and I would feel a sense of calm wash over me.

In the end, Luna was more than just a pet - she was a true friend and companion. She taught me the importance of empathy, compassion, and unconditional love. And even though she is no longer with me, I will always cherish the memories we made together and the lessons she taught me about the power of love and companionship."

Audi cars have been featured in many movies over the years. Did you spot one in these films?
Thought by many to be the most successful movie franchises ever to be created, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has different movies for everyone. There have been 21 films released already — the most recent being Captain Marvel — and at least a dozen more in the pipeline.
You don’t only enjoy the action in these films, but you may also be able to spot a stylish Audi, too.
When it comes to the Iron Man trilogy, at least one Audi has been featured in every film! A 2007 R8 and S5 B8 can be found in the first movie, a 2009 A8 LD3 and 2010 R8 Spyder are spotted in the sequel, and a 2012 S7 and R8 e-tron are both featured in Iron Man 3. The R8 e-tron also turned up at a VIP screening of Iron Man 3 at London’s Leicester Square a few days before the movie’s general release.
Another Audi fact is that there were almost as many Audi cars in the three Iron Man movies as there was in one Captain America film (Civil War). Within its two hours and 27 minutes runtime, you can see the 2017 Audi R8 V10 Plus, the 2017 SQ7, the 2017 A4, the 2016 A7 Sportback and even the Audi prologue concept car — a vehicle hailed as a “signature car” for Audi by Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Board Member for Development at Audi.
There’s more than meets the eye, though. Be on the lookout for an Audi R8, A6 Hybrid and A3 as you watch the excitement unfold in Avengers: Age of Ultron, as well as an Audi TTS Roadster, R8 Spyder, Q7 and A8 during Spider-Man Homecoming — the first standalone film by our favorite web-slinger since he became involved in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Taking a step back from the Marvel Universe, the German brand is also spotted in other film adaptations of comic book heroes. An R8 Spyder feature in Wolverine — the titular protagonist’s actor Hugh Jackman even turned up at the London Leicester Square premiere of the film in the same car — and an A8 plays a role in the 2015 big screen edition of Fantastic Four.
You also might’ve noticed the German manufacturer’s presence in all three film adaptations of E.L. James’ novels, which follow the relationship of business magnate Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.
What made this brand of car most attractive to the directors of this film? The brand’s multiple appearances came as a result of a partnership that was set up between Audi and Universal Pictures — a deal that Audi no doubt has relished seeing as the movie series has grossed over $1 billion across the globe!
In the first film of the trilogy, movie fans will be able to spot an Audi S8 D4, a 2017 S7 and an R8 Spyder. In the sequel, Fifty Shades Darker, a set of Audi Q7 cars and an A3 took center stage, with both the R8 and Q7 returning when the franchise wrapped up last year with Fifty Shades Freed.
To talk about Audi’s feature in Mission Impossible, let’s rewind back to the year 2000 and Mission: Impossible 2 to showcase how Audi has been featured in the hit movie series that has always starred Tom Cruise in the lead role of Ethan Hunt.
In a thrilling part of the film, Hunt leads a mission to destroy a deadly biological weapon and finds himself in an exhilarating car chase with international thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall. Hunt is behind the wheel of a Porsche Boxster and Nordoff-Hall tries to hold him off while driving an Audi TT — suffice to say that the pursuit between the two German-made cars into oncoming traffic is filled with nail-biting and edge-of-your-seat drama!
We couldn’t create an article about movies and cars without mentioning the Fast and Furious franchise. After all, this is a series that features street racing, heists, and espionage using all manners of vehicles, and has so far spanned eight main series entries and two additional short films — grossing in excess of $5 billion to date.
Fans are continually impressed with films that come out as part of this movie set. In fact, a spin-off movie called Hobbs & Shaw is due for release this summer.
Bringing a focus to Furious 7 now — a movie that clutched at the heartstrings as it was the final one to feature an appearance by series regular Paul Walker due to the actor being killed while the movie was still being filmed — is where you can see Audi appearing in the franchise.
You can spot the Audi R8 when it competes in an exciting quarter-mile race against a classic Plymouth Barracuda in the early moments of the film.
In the previously discussed films, the Audi’s that were featured are all models that exist. With I, ROBOT though, we’re taken to the future to see what Audi cars may potentially look like in years to come. Called the Audi RSQ, this concept vehicle represented the first time Audi had ever develop a car that was to be specifically used in a major Hollywood motion picture.
This futuristic model boasted piloted driving which allowed Will Smith’s Chicago police detective character Del Spooner to press a button to enable the car to take control of the driving — no doubt an early vision of the autonomous driving concept that we are only just starting to see being trialed in real life.
Those who take a ride in the RSQ are able to ride sideways and diagonal, while the use of balls instead of wheels was a quirky design touch. However, the typical single-frame grille and the presence of those four instantly recognizable silver rings let viewers clearly know that this car was without question an Audi.
This article was created by Audi & VW service provider, Vindis. What special features did the futuristic Audi RSQ have in the movie I, ROBOT?",

Some of the key factors that led to these events include:

1. Overpopulation: The Viking Age saw a significant increase in population in Scandinavia, which led to a shortage of land and resources. This led to a desire for expansion and the need to find new territories to settle and plunder.

2. Economic instability: The Viking Age was a time of economic instability in Europe, with many trade routes disrupted and the Carolingian Empire in decline. This created an opportunity for the Vikings to take advantage of the situation and engage in raids and plunder.

3. Technological advancements: The Vikings were skilled craftsmen and inventors, and they developed new technologies such as the longship, which allowed them to travel quickly and efficiently across the seas. This made it easier for them to launch raids and invasions.

4. Cultural and social factors: The Viking Age was a time of significant cultural and social change in Scandinavia, with the rise of chieftains and kings and the development of a more complex social hierarchy. This led to a desire for prestige and power, which was often achieved through raids and invasions.

5. Climate change: The Viking Age was also a time of significant climate change, with a cooling of the climate in the 9th and 10th centuries. This led to crop failures and famine in Scandinavia, which further increased the desire for expansion and the need to find new resources.

Overall, the combination of these factors created an environment in which Viking raids and invasions were more likely to occur."

Passage: Molly Ivins was the most popular liberal commentator of the last 25 years. Bill Minutaglio, author of a new biography of the tangy Texan, on why her voice is needed now more than ever.
There was Morley Safer, in a scrum of old hardball Texas liberals and graying hippies, and hanging out at his late friend Molly Ivins's favorite bar in Austin. With pitchers of Shiner everywhere, Safer was engulfed by dozens of folks wondering what the hell the woman who once had millions of faithful readers would say about health care, Afghanistan, and, yes, Rush Limbaugh’s attempt to own a piece of the Texas Blood Sport, otherwise known as professional football.
Safer, in town to donate his papers to the University of Texas, decided to drop by the book launch for my new biography of the ferociously mercurial and troubled Ivins.
Amid the weathered longhairs, musicians, underground cartoonists and civil liberties lawyers who once formed Austin's counterculture—the people Ivins called “freedom fighters”—Safer seemed merrily caught up in the nostalgia.
""She was one of the funniest and (most) thoughtful women I've ever met,"" Safer told a reporter from The Daily Texan. ""She was a great reporter, and we were good friends.""
Close to three years after her death, he's not alone in missing Ivins.
Nose around the Internet and you'll find plenty of other people still wishing she was writing—and wondering what Ivins, if she hadn't succumbed almost three years ago to cancer and a lifetime of wild personal rides, would have to say about the discourse in the twilight of 2009.
They miss the Texas cornpone flavored with a Tabasco sting, the unabashed defrocking she subjected the potentates to when they stole the stage. Maybe we need Molly—frequently described as “the only woman in the room”—more than ever before.
Her domineering father was the president of Tenneco and pals with men like Sen. John Tower, she grew up with George W. Bush, she was engaged to the son of a diplomat who did the CIA’s bidding. But after years of going to war with her controlling old man, devouring seditious issues of the muckraking Texas Observer, and furtively meeting the bravest Texas progressives, she eventually decided to raise a middle finger to all of her gilded upbringing.
It took a few years and some intense trip wires—the violent death of that fiance, her love affair with a ballsy activist, her knocking Bush's gun-toting political godfather to his knees one night in a Texas bar, her telling her bosses at The New York Times to shove it—but she finally found her calling as the most popular liberal political commentator in the last 25 years.
The fact that she did it in the Lone Star State, amid the misogynistic and Jack Daniels-fueled kingmakers, was rather startling to say the least. She fought sexual gropings by famous drunk politicos, three bouts of cancer, her own rampaging alcoholism—and plenty of death threats.
Through it all, Ivins kept the home fires burning for wandering progressives, liberal Israelites, who felt marginalized since the dawn of The Age of Reagan.
So, what would Molly Ivins say to those millions of readers today, including the ones beginning to think there has been some bait-and-switch at work with Obama?
Divorced from how you feel about her politics, most students of her work knew that she had perfected a magic act when it came to that public discourse; she talked about politics without the dour aura of either Emma Goldman or Charles Krauthammer. Nor did she scream with the raging acidity of Bill O’Reilly and Glenn Beck and their counterparts on the left. She chortled that Dubya was affable but a policy buffoon; she actually liked him personally, but hated his politics. And she spent years, and made a mint, working Bush over like his political career was one big speed bag. It was, as she sometimes told me and other folks in Austin, almost too easy.
Today, it might be a bit harder. She liked Obama and she thought he was far smarter than Bush. She’d maybe have to tap the piñata a bit more lightly in order to say what she wanted to say about Obama, about any sense of failed promises. But she would do it, and do it her way.
She would do it because she didn’t believe that a democracy was served very well by the vitriol, by the poison, by the hatred snaking through the discourse.
Bill Minutaglio is co-author, with W. Michael Smith, of Molly Ivins: A Rebel Life, released this week by PublicAffairs. He is a professor of journalism at The University of Texas at Austin and the author of several books, including George W. Bush & The Bush Family Dynasty and The President’s Counselor: The Rise to Power of Alberto Gonzales.",Morley Safer described his friendship with Molly Ivins as one of the funniest and most thoughtful women he had ever met. He also mentioned that she was a great reporter and that they were good friends. He missed her after her death and wished she was still writing.

We stumbl’d upon each other.

Why do I say I love you.?  Were you sincere when you said amen to the wisdom that I shared, were you one of those who thought your mocking, was more valuable than complianceI have lived with the resentments of scoffers.

Who Would Want To Be This Cold?
They said you needed surgery.
I drove you to the funeral home.
The arrangements were for you.
I had to wait outside that day.
I couldn't go in there.
I don't know how you made those plans.
You showed how much you cared.
You knew you wouldn't make it.
You feared the end was near.
I hate what your life did to you.
I wish you were still here.
How do you plan your funeral?
Were you as scared as I?

yet all I feel is an emptiness inside..
Why did you have to leave?
Why does this have to hurt?
Cancer robbed thy life from thee..
But you went to heaven, and you went away.
That we'd die together in forevers sleep.
You didn't even say goodbye as you left me here.
I'm failing to choke down all these tears.
My face becomes moist, my sight turns to mist.
With my frown turned lips, i give you a kiss.
I try to look away as they lower your casket.
I'll try to survive, but I don't think i can las it.
I throw your favorite flowers into your grave.
Watching people throw dirt, over you they pave.
I feel no solace, I'm all alone.
As I see your name set in stone.
I feel a breeze, it's a wind so cold.
I remember the final words you had told..
You said to me, ""Don't take your life.""
I asked you, ""Why?"", as I put down the knife.
You told me you loved me, as its your final wish.
I shook my head yes, though I feel no bliss.
Why god took you away from me, but i will live on.
I hear your comforting whispers, I think its a sign.
So I know I'll see you agian when its my time.
The skeletal remains are being chalked out,while mystery and intrigue are engraven, cryptic.Lying beneath, this freshly seeded idea;upon these grounds, the words are etched,what are you looking for and how will you get it,for these are but the bare bones of a story.The key alone is in your closet, slowly turning,as you opened the creaking rusted door.You slowly peep inside the mausoleum of your mind,where cobwebs hang on every angle.Suddenly, a cold swift draft blows across your spine,as if someone has just, walked on your grave. You look up to see, all the entrapping’s laidbut then again, you are still lying in a good plot.
I’m going home to Jesus where He waits for me.
Spread your colored petals and cradle tender showers.
Ought we not to know the Tender of such lovely garden groves?
To cut away the stems of old for fuller future years.
Looking daily to their needs; so faithfully He waters.
When the Gardener comes to claim each one the earth held as its own.
He gently picks it at its peak and for His pleasure takes it home.
As God did one glorious morning, when the Perfect Rose had bloomed.
He rolled away the stone and met with Mary at the tomb.
There the sweetest Rose of Sharon rose that we die not alone.
But be gathered for a garden grove, surrounding heaven's throne.
I pray you will find.
and a peace of mind.
with God, you shall prevail.
you will never, never fail.
If not for people like YOU!

If you managed to generate very good ideas, conducted a thorough research, and organized your paper logically, but have made several grammar or spelling mistakes, your grade would be lowered. Revising and editing academic paper should be done several days prior to submission. Why? Because you need to leave your writing aside and then look at it with the fresh eye. Term paper editing is not about looking through your writing while listening to music, you need to be very attention and stay focused on numerous details.
First, take a look at your essay outline. Go through all points and try to change the order of ideas: make sure you have created a logical structure and ideas are presented either chronologically or thematically (from the least important to the most important). Locate thesis statement. Is it clear? Are there topic sentences in each paragraph? Are they related to the thesis statement? Are connections between the paragraphs clear or do you jump from one idea to another?
Essay body should contain enough supporting details contributing to thesis statement development. For example, if your topic is legalization of marijuana, you need to find at least three arguments supporting your point of view and provide rebuttal to the opposing views. Introduction and conclusion should not contain new information: introduction should provide general background information on the topic and inform the reader about your main idea, while conclusion should round up the whole essay.
Pay attention to each paragraph: it should include topic sentence and cover one point of discussion. Make sure you do not repeat the same idea twice in different parts of essay. Repeating is a sign of poor organization. Check the grammar - ask your parents or friends to assist you with essay editing . Pay attention to correct punctuation, avoid too short or too long sentences.
Revising is not the same as editing. Essay editing is about correcting mistakes, while essay revising is making major changes in your writing, adding ideas and deleting material. Revising should lead to overall paper improvement. Read your essay and if you do not like it, revise it. Ask yourself the following questions: what do I need to prove? What is the main idea? Is there enough supporting evidence? Are arguments clear and logical? Is my essay easy to understand? Have I cited all sources? Is introduction attention getting? Is conclusion logical?
Essay editing, proofreading, and revision is one of the services offered to high school and college students at Custom-Essay.ws.

Analyze the potential of nuclear fusion as a viable and sustainable source of energy in the near future, taking into account factors such as efficiency, cost, and environmental impact. Additionally, explore any challenges and obstacles that need to be overcome in order to fully realize the potential of this technology. Finally, present your findings and recommendations on the feasibility of nuclear fusion as an alternative energy source.","Nuclear fusion is a process in which atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. This process is the same as the one that powers the sun and other stars. Nuclear fusion has the potential to be a sustainable and clean source of energy, as it does not produce any greenhouse gas emissions or long-lived radioactive waste. However, achieving controlled nuclear fusion has proven to be a significant challenge.

The most recent research and development findings in nuclear fusion have focused on the development of new materials and technologies that can withstand the extreme conditions required for fusion reactions to occur. For example, researchers have developed new materials that can withstand the high temperatures and pressures required for fusion reactions, and have also developed new technologies for heating and confining the plasma that is necessary for fusion reactions to occur.

Despite these advancements, there are still several challenges that need to be overcome in order to fully realize the potential of nuclear fusion as an alternative energy source. For example, the development of a practical and cost-effective method for generating and confining the plasma that is necessary for fusion reactions to occur is still an open challenge. Additionally, the development of materials that can withstand the extreme conditions required for fusion reactions to occur is also an ongoing challenge.

In terms of the potential of nuclear fusion as a viable and sustainable source of energy, it is difficult to predict exactly when it will become a reality. However, many experts believe that it will be possible to achieve controlled nuclear fusion within the next few decades. If this is the case, it could potentially provide a significant source of clean and sustainable energy in the future.

In conclusion, the current state of nuclear fusion technology is promising, but there are still several challenges that need to be overcome in order to fully realize its potential. However, if successful, nuclear fusion could provide a significant source of clean and sustainable energy in the future."

Utilize standardized mental health assessment tools and consider potential confounding variables (e.g. socioeconomic status, age, gender). Present findings in a well-organized report including both descriptive and inferential statistics.","Introduction:
Urbanization is a growing trend worldwide, with many cities experiencing rapid growth and development. However, this growth can also have negative impacts on mental health. The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between various urbanization indicators and mental health outcomes in a specific urban area.

Methods:
A cross-sectional study was conducted using a representative sample of 1000 residents in a specific urban area. Participants were recruited through a combination of online and in-person recruitment methods. Participants completed a standardized mental health assessment tool (e.g. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) for anxiety, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) for stress) and provided information on various urbanization indicators (e.g. population density, housing conditions, green space availability). Potential confounding variables (e.g. socioeconomic status, age, gender) were also collected.

Results:
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the distribution of urbanization indicators and mental health outcomes. Inferential statistics (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression) were used to examine the correlation between urbanization indicators and mental health outcomes, controlling for potential confounding variables.

Findings:
The results of the study suggest that there is a significant correlation between urbanization indicators and mental health outcomes. Specifically, higher population density was associated with increased symptoms of depression and anxiety, while better housing conditions were associated with lower symptoms of depression and anxiety. Green space availability was also associated with lower symptoms of depression and anxiety.

Conclusion:
The findings of this study suggest that urbanization indicators are correlated with mental health outcomes in a specific urban area. The results highlight the importance of considering the impact of urbanization on mental health when planning and developing urban areas. Future studies should investigate the causal relationship between urbanization indicators and mental health outcomes, as well as explore potential interventions to mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization on mental health."
f196b76e0086fdda0cfae577edb3cd031fadba76dc6002ea2a51695a6b4babb0,Compare Venice's urban planning and architecture to that of other major European cities during the same historical period.,"Venice's urban planning and architecture during the 12th to 16th centuries were unique and distinct from those of other major European cities during the same period. Here are some key differences:

1. Water-based city: Venice was built on water, which influenced its urban planning and architecture. The city's canals and waterways played a crucial role in its development, with many buildings and structures constructed on water or with water-based transportation systems. In contrast, other European cities were built on land and did not have the same level of water-based infrastructure.

2. Byzantine influence: Venice's architecture was heavily influenced by Byzantine styles, which were characterized by the use of domes, arches, and ornate decoration. This is evident in the city's many Byzantine-style churches and palaces. In contrast, other European cities, such as Paris and Rome, were influenced by Romanesque and Gothic styles.

3. Use of wood: Venice was known for its use of wood in construction, particularly in the construction of its famous bridges and buildings. This was due to the availability of wood in the surrounding forests and the city's lack of access to other building materials. In contrast, other European cities, such as Paris and Rome, used stone and brick in their construction.

4. Narrow streets: Venice's narrow streets and canals were designed to facilitate the movement of people and goods through the city. This was particularly important in a city that was built on water, where the use of canals and waterways was essential for transportation. In contrast, other European cities, such as Paris and Rome, had wider streets and boulevards that were designed for the movement of horse-drawn carriages and other vehicles.

5. Use of ornate decoration: Venice was known for its use of ornate decoration in its architecture, particularly in the form of mosaics, frescoes, and intricate carvings. This was a key feature of Byzantine architecture and was used to adorn many of Venice's buildings and churches. In contrast, other European cities, such as Paris and Rome, used simpler forms of decoration in their architecture.

Overall, Venice's urban planning and architecture during the 12th to 16th centuries were unique and distinct from those of other major European cities during the same period. The city's use of water-based infrastructure, Byzantine architectural styles, and ornate decoration were all key features that set it apart from other cities."

In your review, discuss the overarching themes and motifs of the story, the depth of the character development, the quality of the writing style, and any literary devices that the author used to enhance the narrative. Additionally, evaluate how the story affected you on a personal level and whether or not you would recommend it to others.","I recently read ""The Nightingale"" by Kristin Hannah, a historical fiction novel set in France during World War II. The story follows two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle, as they navigate the challenges of living in occupied France and fighting against the Nazi regime.

One of the most striking aspects of this book is its exploration of the themes of war, sacrifice, and the power of human resilience. The author masterfully weaves together the stories of the two sisters, each with their own unique struggles and triumphs, to create a narrative that is both deeply personal and universally relatable.

The character development in this book is exceptional. The author takes the time to flesh out each character, giving them distinct personalities, motivations, and backstories that make them feel fully realized and authentic. The relationships between the characters are also well-developed, with a particular focus on the bond between the two sisters.

The writing style in this book is engaging and immersive. The author has a talent for creating vivid descriptions of the setting and characters, which transported me to the world of occupied France. The pacing of the story is well-balanced, with a mix of action, suspense, and emotional moments that kept me engaged throughout.

The author also uses a range of literary devices to enhance the narrative, including symbolism, foreshadowing, and imagery. For example, the nightingale that gives the book its title is a recurring symbol throughout the story, representing hope, freedom, and the power of the human spirit.

On a personal level, this book had a profound impact on me. It made me realize the importance of resilience, sacrifice, and the power of human connection in the face of adversity. It also made me appreciate the sacrifices that people made during World War II and the importance of preserving their stories and memories.

Overall, I would highly recommend ""The Nightingale"" to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, strong female protagonists, and stories of resilience and hope. The book is a powerful and moving exploration of the human experience during times of war and occupation, and it is a testament to the power of the human spirit to overcome even the most daunting challenges."

This is a very famous and liked by one and all. It is made with khoya, but now a days many instant mixes available in the market. With the instant mix, making it is very easy, but the taste differs from the one made with khoya. Once we taste the jamun made with khoya, we won't like to have them with the ready mix. I made them with khoya this time. All of us in my family liked very much. This I made as my kids' Birthday special. I have learned it from my neighbouring friend Geetha, who makes them only with khoya. Some people add rose water also. Khoya can be made at home or we can get it from stores also. But make sure that it should be fresh and a bit tighter and harder. Add a little all purpose flour to it and make jamuns. The shop keeper who sold khoya to me revealed the trick of the trade, that they add milk powder also to it, to make more softer and tastier jamuns. So we added that also in it. Combine water, sugar and cardamom, mix till the sugar dissolves. Bring it to boil. Boil it for 8 to 10 mins. Make a thin syrup. Sugar particles should not stick to the vessel, this will the syrup crystallizes, once it cooled. Add cardamom, I added the seeds directly, not the powder of it. Combine khoya, all purpose flour and milk powder together. Mix well and make soft dough out of it. Do not knead. Make small and equal sized balls. While making them press gently between palms and make round shaped balls. Heat oil in a deep and thick bottomed kadai. Do not over heat. Simmer the stove and slowly drop each ball into it. Cook them in a low to medium flame, stirring occasionally. If we cook them on high flame, they turn into brown outside and won't cook inside. Cook them till they turn brown in color. They should get nice golden brown color. Remove them from heat and slowly immerse them in sugar syrup. Let the sugar syrup be warm, even if it cooled, warm it for 2 minutes. Keep them in the syrup till we serve. Serve sweet and soft gulab jamuns cold or hot, either way is tasty. I like spongy sweets such as Rasgulla, Gulab gamun, and cham cham. The sugary juice with essence of makes the sweet even tastier. Can you suggest some variations to make gulab jamun more unique and flavorful?",

Jason Nisbit, 39, is facing a charge of second degree homicide with intent in the death of 26-year-old Chelsea Martinez. A friend said Martinez’s husband found she'd been on a social networking site and had an exchange of disturbing messages with a man in Minnesota. Investigators tracked the profile to Nisbit. In the messages, Martinez said she can't wait to die but expresses fear over the idea. The two discuss how Nisbit will do it. Martinez said she will finally be at peace and thanks him. Martinez's car and body were found near a Minnesota park last week. Police say Nisbit admitted to killing her and took them to the body. Nisbit told police the two met at the park then walked a ways to a wooded area, saying he ""knew there was water available if he needed to wash anything off."" In the complaint, Nisbit said he tied Martinez's hands and feet with a cord then strangled her with another cord. After she passed out, he says he cut her throat with a knife. The complaint goes on to say he dragged her body to a culvert and partially covered her with dirt. Family and friends said the young mother of three battled depression and other mental issues her whole life and had been suicidal in the past. Minnesota authorities said Nisbit has no criminal record, only a few minor traffic offenses. He will be back in court August 24. Bond was set at $1 million. What was the evidence that led investigators to track Jason Nisbit in connection to the disappearance and death of Chelsea Martinez?","The evidence that led investigators to track Jason Nisbit in connection to the disappearance and death of Chelsea Martinez was the exchange of disturbing messages between Martinez and Nisbit on a social networking site. Martinez expressed fear and said she couldn't wait to die, and Nisbit discussed how he would kill her.

Furthermore, investigate potential methods and strategies for quitting smoking, such as nicotine replacement therapy, counseling, and support groups. In your discussion, address the effectiveness, advantages, and disadvantages of these methods for individuals looking to quit smoking.","The effects of nicotine on the human body are multifaceted and can be both short-term and long-term. Nicotine is a highly addictive substance that can cause a range of physical and psychological effects, including cardiovascular, central nervous system, and respiratory system impacts.

Short-term effects of nicotine on the cardiovascular system include increased heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output. This can lead to increased blood flow to the brain, which can cause feelings of alertness and improved concentration. However, this increased blood flow can also increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular events.

Long-term effects of nicotine on the cardiovascular system include increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Nicotine can also increase blood pressure and heart rate, which can further increase the risk of cardiovascular events.

Nicotine can also have a significant impact on the central nervous system. It can cause feelings of relaxation and reduced anxiety, which can be beneficial for individuals who are experiencing stress or anxiety. However, nicotine can also cause feelings of agitation, irritability, and restlessness, which can be detrimental to overall mental health.

Nicotine can also have a significant impact on the respiratory system. It can cause bronchospasm, which can lead to wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Long-term use of nicotine can also increase the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which can lead to chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

There are several methods and strategies for quitting smoking, including nicotine replacement therapy, counseling, and support groups. Nicotine replacement therapy involves the use of nicotine-containing products, such as gum, lozenges, or patches, to help reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Counseling can provide individuals with the support and guidance they need to quit smoking, while support groups can provide a sense of community and camaraderie with others who are also trying to quit.

The effectiveness of these methods can vary depending on the individual and their specific circumstances. Nicotine replacement therapy can be effective for some individuals, but it may not be effective for others. Counseling and support groups can also be effective, but they may not be as effective for individuals who are not motivated to quit.

Overall, the effects of nicotine on the human body can be both short-term and long-term, and can have a significant impact on cardiovascular, central nervous system, and respiratory health. Quitting smoking can be challenging, but there are several methods"

Include vivid descriptions of the eerie environment, Lily's internal struggle with fear, as well as her physical journey to find her way back to the entrance.

As a child, she would spend hours reading about ghost stories and haunted places. So, when she heard about the annual harvest festival at the local farm, she knew she had to go. The main attraction was the haunted corn maze, which was said to be one of the most terrifying in the country.

As she walked through the entrance of the maze, Lily felt a shiver run down her spine. The air was thick with the smell of damp earth and decaying leaves. The corn stalks towered above her, casting long, ominous shadows across the ground.

At first, Lily was excited to explore the maze. She had always loved the thrill of the unknown, and the thought of being lost in a haunted corn maze was exhilarating. But as she walked deeper into the maze, she began to feel a creeping sense of fear. The corn stalks seemed to close in around her, making her feel trapped and claustrophobic.

As she turned a corner, Lily saw a figure standing in front of her. It was tall and gaunt, with sunken eyes and a twisted grin. Lily froze, her heart pounding in her chest. The figure didn't move, but Lily could feel its eyes on her, boring into her skin.

She tried to run, but her legs felt heavy and unresponsive. The figure began to move towards her, its eyes fixed on her face. Lily tried to scream, but her voice was caught in her throat.

Suddenly, the figure vanished. Lily was left standing alone in the maze, her heart still racing with fear. She took a deep breath and tried to calm down, telling herself that it was just her imagination playing tricks on her.

But as she continued to walk through the maze, Lily began to feel a sense of unease. The corn stalks seemed to be closing in around her, making her feel trapped and claustrophobic. She could feel eyes on her, watching her every move.

As she turned another corner, Lily saw a figure standing in front of her. It was the same figure she had seen before, its eyes fixed on her face. This time, it didn't vanish. It began to move towards her, its eyes burning with an otherworldly intensity.

Lily tried to run, but her legs felt heavy and unresponsive. The figure reached out and touched her face, and Lily felt a chill run down her spine."

When questioned about the theft, Schlachter admitted to stealing items “11 to 15 times,” according to an arrest report.
University spokesman Mark Hebert said the school began Schlachter’s “termination process” late last week.
Schlachter has been employed at the school since 2008, Hebert said.

When you want something sweet, it’s hard to resist the classic chocolate chip cookie. It’s sweet. It’s comforting. It’s loyal. It’s basically your BFF.
But, for those times you don’t want your BFF to be loaded with refined sugar, simple carbs, and unhealthy fats, you’re in luck because I gave your BFF a make-over! It’s pretty much the chocolate chip cookie of your dreams. These deep dish cookies are full of protein, low in fat, grain free, and low in sugar. No joke! A typical chocolate chip cookie has about 13 grams of sugar and 2 grams of protein. Howevah, these delicious treats have a whopping 8 grams of protein and a measly 2 grams of refined sugar!
And because I am with everything else in life, I am also indecisive about wanting a super chewy cookie or a really crispy one. So, if you needed another reason to love these deep dish cookies, you get the best of both worlds with them! They have a nice, crispy edge with a soft, chewy center. The trick to getting this combo is baking them in a muffin tin. Not only is it easy and convenient, but it also keeps the cookies from spreading out while baking, giving them the chewy center. And because the batter is touching the pan all the way around, you get a nice, crispy edge. It’s like the corner piece of a pan of brownies, but all around! Once again, it’s like unicorns invaded your dreams and made your wishes come true.
And whipping up these high protein treats couldn’t be any easier. As long as you’ve got a blender or food processor you’re in business, because we’re going to puree some chickpeas. Just trust me on this one. These little gems are going to give your cookies some texture, chewiness, and replaces the flour so the cookies are grain-free. Once you’ve got them pureed, all you need to do is mix the dry ingredients, stir together the wet ingredients, and then combine that all together.
Preheat the oven to 325 F. Grease a 12 cup muffin tin.
In a food processor or blender, puree the chickpeas with the water until smooth.
In a large bowl, add the coconut flour, protein powder, sweetener, baking powder and soda, and salt.
In a seperate bowl, combine the chickpea puree, egg, yogurt, milk, oil, and vanilla. Stir or whisk until fully combined.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until fully incorporated.
Evenly distribute the batter into the prepared muffin tins. It will be about 1.5 - 2 Tbsps of dough per cookie.
Smooth out the batter so batter touches the edges of the pan, but don't press/flatten the dough.
Bake for 14 min. or until the edges of the cookies turn golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cookie dough comes out clean.
Allow the cookies to cool completely in the pan.
Feel free to top with nut butter, jam, or more chocolate and eat 'em up!

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the king and his government actively promoted Western-style clothing and discouraged the use of traditional Thai clothing. This was part of a broader effort to modernize and Westernize Thai society, and to distance the country from its traditional and cultural roots.

As a result, many Thais began to adopt Western-style clothing, such as suits and dresses, and to abandon traditional Thai clothing, such as the sarong and the chong kraben. This led to a decline in the demand for traditional Thai clothing and a loss of traditional textile production skills.

However, in recent years, there has been a renewed interest in traditional Thai clothing and fashion, and many Thais are now seeking to preserve and promote their cultural heritage. This has led to a resurgence in the demand for traditional Thai clothing, and many designers are now incorporating traditional Thai designs and motifs into their designs.

Make sure to include tips for achieving a caramelized crust on the steak without overcooking the inside. Use clear, concise language and provide visuals if possible to make the instructions easy to follow.","Cooking a perfectly seared steak requires attention to detail and a few simple steps. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve a deliciously caramelized crust on the outside and a tender, juicy interior.

**Step 1: Choose the Right Steak**

For a perfectly seared steak, choose a high-quality cut with a good balance of marbling (fat distribution). Ribeye, strip loin, and filet mignon are popular options. For this recipe, we'll use a 1.5-inch thick ribeye steak.

**Step 2: Season the Steak**

Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Season the steak with salt, pepper, and any other seasonings you like (e.g., garlic powder, paprika, or thyme). Let the steak sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to allow the seasonings to penetrate the meat.

**Step 3: Sear the Steak**

Heat a skillet or grill pan over high heat until it reaches 450°F (230°C). Add a small amount of oil (e.g., olive or avocado oil) to the pan and swirl it around to coat the bottom. Place the steak in the pan and sear for 3-4 minutes per side, or until a nice crust forms. Use tongs or a spatula to flip the steak.

**Step 4: Finish Cooking the Steak**

After searing the steak, transfer it to the preheated oven and cook for 8-12 minutes, or until it reaches your desired level of doneness. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature. For medium-rare, the internal temperature should be around 130°F (54°C).

**Step 5: Rest the Steak**

Once the steak is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute and the meat to relax, making it easier to slice and serve.

**Step 6: Slice and Serve**

Slice the steak against the grain (perpendicular to the lines of muscle) and serve immediately. You can serve it with your favorite sides, such as roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a salad.

**Tips for Achieving a Caramelized Crust**

To achieve a caramelized crust on the steak without overcooking the inside, follow these tips:

* Use a hot pan: A hot pan is essential for searing the steak quickly and achieving a caramelized"

Sixth-year medical student, Satyen Hargovan’s honours research project has generated a check-list of the top 10 factors that influence the survival of sepsis patients.
Sepsis is a common medical condition, where chemicals released by the immune system to fight an infection trigger the inflammation and eventual shut-down of multiple organs.
Some 15,700 patients with sepsis are admitted to Australian Intensive Care Units every year. About one in five die. The cost of treating each case is more than $39,000.
“The burden of sepsis is not only in relation to patient outcomes, but also the financial cost to the healthcare system,” Mr Hargovan said.
His project, known as the Cairns Sepsis Model – 4 (CSM- 4) is designed to speed up the assessment of patients within their first four hours in ICU.
The new four-hour mortality prediction model will enable clinicians to detect patients who are at a higher risk of dying, then help to guide their treatment decisions and discussions with the patient and their family.
“Essentially it means that if a patient has a five percent chance of dying, you might treat them less invasively,” he said. “For example, you won’t rush to place them in an induced coma, or insert lines into large arteries or veins.
Mr Hargovan began his research by reviewing more than 50 mortality prediction studies, but soon realized that there was no model in the world specifically designed to predict mortality in adult sepsis patients within four hours of ICU admission.
A case history review of 500 adult sepsis patients admitted to the Cairns Hospital ICU over a four-year period identified 168 factors that could influence patient health outcomes, ranging from age, gender and socio-economic status to type of infection, degree of organ failure, vital signs, blood test results and treatment regimes.
Statistical analysis whittled the figure down to the 10 most significant factors, which include age, history of renal disease, level of consciousness, and abnormal levels of certain substances in the blood that represent varying degrees of organ dysfunction.
The mortality prediction model is inexpensive to use as it largely relies on information easily gleaned from patient history, physical examination, and blood tests that are routinely conducted on patients within their first four hours of admission to an ICU.
The next step involves testing his model on a different and larger set of patients in order to validate his research, before it can be accepted for clinical use.
“Then we’d love to create an online calculator or an app that clinicians can use easily, at the bedside, and have a result within seconds,” he said.

What are the potential benefits of using the mortality prediction model developed by Hargovan, and what is the next step in validating and implementing this model in clinical practice?","The potential benefits of using the mortality prediction model developed by Hargovan include the ability to identify patients who are at a higher risk of dying from sepsis, which can guide treatment decisions and discussions with patients and their families. The model can also help clinicians to avoid unnecessary invasive treatments and reduce the financial burden of treating sepsis patients.

The next step in validating and implementing this model in clinical practice is to test it on a different and larger set of patients to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Once validated, the model can be used as an online calculator or an app that clinicians can use at the bedside to quickly and easily determine a patient's risk of mortality from sepsis."

Incorporate at least three sensory details (sight, smell, sound, touch, taste) to enhance your descriptions. Use your imagination and make your entry vivid for the reader.","Dear Diary,

Today was a purr-fect day. I woke up early, feeling refreshed and ready to take on the world. I stretched my long, sleek body and arched my back, giving a good yawn to signal the start of my day. My fur was soft and silky, and I loved the way it felt as I ran my paw over it.

As I padded out of my cozy bed, I caught a whiff of something delicious. My stomach growled with hunger, and I followed the scent to the kitchen. My human had left a bowl of tasty kibble on the counter, and I couldn't wait to dig in. I munched away, savoring the crunchy texture and the savory flavor.

After breakfast, I decided to take a stroll around the house. I padded silently across the floor, my ears perked up to catch any sounds that might be lurking in the shadows. I sniffed and snuffled, taking in the scents of the house and the garden outside. The air was filled with the sweet aroma of blooming flowers and the earthy smell of damp soil.

As I wandered, I caught sight of a fluttering bird outside the window. I crouched low to the ground, my tail twitching with excitement. I watched as the bird flitted from branch to branch, its bright colors catching the sunlight. I could almost taste the thrill of the hunt, and I purred with anticipation.

After my morning stroll, I curled up in a sunbeam to take a nap. The warmth on my fur was heavenly, and I felt my eyelids growing heavy. I drifted off to sleep, lulled by the sound of birds chirping outside and the gentle hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen.

Later in the day, my human came home and gave me a treat. I purred and rubbed against her leg, happy to see her. She scratched behind my ears, and I purred even louder, feeling like the luckiest cat in the world.

As the sun began to set, I curled up in my bed once more, feeling content and full. I closed my eyes and listened to the sounds of the house, feeling grateful for this cozy little life I lead. And as I drifted off to sleep, I knew that tomorrow would be another purr-fect day."

I am making it weekly because they love it so much. The recipe is fabulous, but needed some tweaks. I doubled the recipe and added 2 eggs, used organic brown rice flour in place of wheat, and substituted 1/2 tsp garlic powder and hot water for the chicken broth. The cookies keep well in the fridge. I made these for my Yorkie/Rat Terrier mix and when they came out of the oven his tail was wagging just from the smell. He LOVES them. What can I substitute for the cheese in this dog treat recipe? I don't feed my dog cheese (let's be honest--it's basically junk food that doesn't belong in an adult dog's diet). Is there anything that you recommend substituting the cheese with? Or can I just leave it out? You could substitute the cheese for an 1/8 cup of ground flax or wheat bran. Is there something else I could use besides oats and wheat flour for this recipe? Chef's Comments ~ That's a great question. You can easily substitute the flour in this and most of our dog treat recipes. A few good grain free flours include almond flour, chickpea flour, potato flour and soy flour. Most of those flours should be available at a major grocery store. As far as substituting the oats, that's a little trickier, but it can be done. The oats are in the recipe for texture and soaking up moisture, so that's what you'll need to replace. First, you will want to halve the amount of oats and add an extra 1/2 cup of flour (or a mixture of the previously mentioned flours). Then you can add a 1/2 cup combination of unsweetened coconut, chopped peanuts and crumbled almond crackers. Or, you could replace all of the oats with the flour mixture. Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? If so, does it still need to be microwaved? Chef's Answer ~ That's a great question! :) I haven't tried this recipe with fresh spinach, but I don't see why it couldn't work. If you minced the spinach very fine, my guess is that you would not need to microwave, or otherwise cook, the spinach before adding it to the dog treat dough. Comments for Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? Is it necessary to store these cookies in a Refrigerator? Since these are cookies, can it be kept in air tight container outside? And how long would it last if this is done? Chef's Comments ~ You can get lots of tips on How to Store Dog Treats on my website. Unless you live in a very cold climate, most dog treats need to be kept indoors, and even better in the refrigerator. My dogs is algeric to grain. What can I use instead of the whole whear flour? My Husky can't have grain. What can I use besides whole wheat flour. You should put more recipes with no grain in them. Chef's Answer ~ You can replace the wheat flour in most of my dog treat recipes with a non-grain flour. For example, any type of bean flour like Chick Pea (Garbanzo Bean) flour, or ""flours"" from nuts. They are technically nut meals, but they work as flour, for example almond meal. You should be able to find grain free flours at specialty grocery stores, or at health food stores. Very good simple recipe, however wheat flour isn't something I would normally have in my cupboard. Would it be ok to use plain flour or self raising? Chef's Answer ~ Yes, you can use all purpose flour in place of the whole wheat flour. I do not recommend using self-rising flour because it has the addition of baking powder or baking soda added to it. These are things that homemade dog treats do not need. Can fresh/raw spinach be used in place of frozen spinach in a particular dog treat recipe, and does it need to be cooked beforehand?",

Generate according to: Onur Unal is Senior Art Director at Propaganda Advertising Agency in Istanbul.
It all started back in my childhood, I always interested in drawing doodles, reading comics and creating characters. I was inspired by humour magazines, and I was dreaming of become a caricature artist. I took courses on drawing technics, and after graduating from high school, I studied Graphic Design at Marmara University Fine Arts Faculty in Istanbul, Turkey.
During school, I got interested in advertising, and started an internship at Mullen Lowe Istanbul and TBWA Istanbul to practice on creative thinking and art direction. After that, I started to work for Big34, and a year after I accepted for Manajans/JWT. It was the most important years of my career.
I worked on important advertising campaigns of global clients, and won national and international advertising awards as Crystal Apple, Cannes Lions. I’m currently working for Propaganda Advertising Agency, and continue to design creative ideas for our clients.
I work for advertising agencies as an art director since 2009. I work for global and local clients as Nokia, Elidor/Sunsilk, Bosch, Shell, Turkcell, Mazda, Kia, Turkish Airlines, Hyundai, Nestle, Beko, Michelin, BMW, Red Bull, Mitsubishi Electric, Bayer, etc. I work mostly full-time at the office, and these days I also design mobile games with a freelance team.
I learnt that I should keep learning. As the technology and the design trends develop day by day, designers should stay updated. Last year I attended a design week about UX and digital design in London to learn more about digital design principles. During the week, I attended workshops at the design offices, and met designers from all over the world. It was a great experience to compare myself, and now I have new targets for my career.
I always try to find an exciting idea to get inspired. It can be anything – an interesting visual, a strong speech, a good music, anything. To find it, I make a quick research, take some notes and draw sketches. After, I brainstorm with our creative team and we share our ideas. Then the design process starts, I put on my headphones and focus on the design. After designing many alternatives, we make a discussion with our creative team and choose the best one.
The main materials I use are a blank sheet, a pen and creative thinking. All other tools and computer programs help to complete the final process.
Currently I work for Propaganda Advertising Agency. We have a beautiful office at the center of Istanbul with a nice view. I usually go to work around 9:30 am, have my breakfast while reading the news and after that the work begins. I work with a copywriter, and our team lead by a creative director. We usually make meetings at the beginning of the week with our brand executives, and we make a schedule for the deadlines. I usually work until 6:00 – 7:00 pm during the week, but under curtain some circumstances, we work overtimes and also weekends.
As my carreer began, I mostly worked on advertising campaigns, print materials, 360 ideas and digital advertising. Recently, I have been interested in UI, UX and digital design, and want to combine my creative background on advertising with the innovative projects.
During my short study in London last year, I had the chance to work and share my ideas with the designers all over the world, and I discovered things that I had never seen before.
I always believe that a designer should be in contact with all other designers and I want to cross the borders and surround myself with creative people around the world in my own studio.
