Here are some key strategies:

1. Energy Efficiency: Implementing energy-efficient building materials, appliances, and systems can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of a housing development. This includes using insulation, energy-efficient windows, and solar panels.

2. Water Conservation: Water-saving measures such as rainwater harvesting, greywater recycling, and low-flow fixtures can help reduce water consumption and waste.

3. Green Spaces: Incorporating green spaces, such as parks, gardens, and rooftop gardens, can help improve air quality, reduce heat island effect, and provide habitats for wildlife.

4. Walkability and Public Transportation: Designing neighborhoods that are walkable and have easy access to public transportation can help reduce car usage and associated emissions.

5. Sustainable Materials: Using sustainable materials in construction, such as recycled or reclaimed wood, can help reduce the environmental impact of the development.

6. Waste Management: Implementing a comprehensive waste management system that includes recycling, composting, and minimizing packaging can help reduce waste and promote a circular economy.

7. Community Engagement: Involving the community in the planning and design process can help ensure that the development meets the needs and values of the people who will live there.

8. Resilience: Building resilience into the development by considering factors such as flood risk, heatwaves, and extreme weather events can help ensure that the development is able to withstand and recover from these events.

9. Smart Technology: Integrating smart technology, such as smart grids, smart meters, and smart home systems, can help improve energy efficiency and reduce waste.

10. Education and Awareness: Providing education and awareness programs to residents about sustainable living can help promote a culture of sustainability within the development.

By implementing these strategies, housing developments can be designed to be more sustainable, reducing their environmental impact and promoting a more livable and resilient community."

1. Make sure your `docker-compose.yml` file is in the correct directory and that the service names match the ones in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. Check that your services are defined correctly in the `docker-compose.yml` file, including the correct image names and any necessary environment variables.
3. Check that your services are running by running `docker-compose ps`. If a service is not running, you can start it by running `docker-compose up [service_name]`.
4. Check that your network is defined correctly in the `docker-compose.yml` file, including the correct network name and any necessary links between services.
5. Check that your network is running by running `docker network ls`. If a network is not running, you can start it by running `docker network create [network_name]`.
6. Check that your services are linked correctly to your network by running `docker network inspect [network_name]`. If a service is not linked to the network, you can link it by running `docker network connect [network_name] [service_name]`.
7. Check that your services are accessible by running `docker-compose exec [service_name] [command]`. If a service is not accessible, you can try running the command directly on the service by running `docker exec [service_container_id] [command]`.
8. Check that your services are using the correct ports by running `docker-compose port [service_name]`. If a service is not using the correct port, you can try changing the port in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
9. Check that your services are using the correct volumes by running `docker-compose volumes`. If a service is not using the correct volume, you can try changing the volume in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
10. Check that your services are using the correct environment variables by running `docker-compose env ["

This could suggest that the author feels trapped or cut off from others, and that they are struggling to find a way out of their current situation.

However, a common recommendation is to have at least one plant per 100 square feet of space.

For a closet office, which is typically smaller, you might want to consider having a few air-purifying plants. Some popular choices include:

1. Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata): This plant is known for its ability to remove toxins like benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene from the air.

2. Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum): This plant is effective at removing formaldehyde and xylene from the air.

3. Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum wallisii): This plant is known for its ability to remove toxins like benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene from the air.

4. Boston Fern (Nephrolepis exaltata): This plant is effective at removing formaldehyde and xylene from the air.

5. English Ivy (Hedera helix): This plant is known for its ability to remove toxins like benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene from the air.

Remember, while plants can help improve air quality, they are not a substitute for proper ventilation and air filtration systems. It's also important to note that different plants have different light and water requirements, so make sure to choose plants that are suitable for your specific space and conditions.

Lastly, it's always a good idea to consult with a professional or do some research to ensure you're making the best choice for your specific situation."

Moreover, could you share a Ruby script capable of producing a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table?","Creating a comprehensive comparison chart in HTML table format and a bar graph using Ruby code involves two separate steps. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. Creating an HTML table comparison chart:

First, let's create a Ruby script that generates an HTML table comparing traditional education and online education based on the aspects you mentioned.

```ruby
require 'json'

data = {
  ""Traditional Education"" => {
    ""Cost"" => ""High"",
    ""Flexibility"" => ""Low"",
    ""Interaction"" => ""High"",
    ""Resources"" => ""Limited"",
    ""Learning Outcomes"" => ""Varies""
  },
  ""Online Education"" => {
    ""Cost"" => ""Low"",
    ""Flexibility"" => ""High"",
    ""Interaction"" => ""Variable"",
    ""Resources"" => ""Unlimited"",
    ""Learning Outcomes"" => ""Varies""
  }
}

html = ""<table>\n""
html += ""<tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Traditional Education</th><th>Online Education</th></tr>\n""

data.each do |category, details|
  html += ""<tr><td>#{category}</td><td>#{details[""Cost""]}</td><td>#{details[""Cost""]}</td></tr>\n""

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]
Student:","To solve this instance, we need to find the product of all odd numbers in each inner list and return a list with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. Here's the solution:

```python
def multiply_odds(lst):
    result = []
    for sublist in lst:
        odd_product = 1
        for num in sublist:
            if num % 2 != 0:
                odd_product *= num
        result.append(odd_product)
    return result

# Test the function
lst = [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]
print(multiply_odds(lst))
```

This code defines a function `multiply_odds` that takes a list of lists as input and returns a list of the products of all odd numbers in each inner list. The function iterates through each sublist and checks if the number is odd. If it is, the function multiplies it with the current odd product. Finally, the function appends the odd product to the result list.

The test case provided in the problem statement is used to test the function. The output of the code is:

```python
[0, 1260, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

This output matches the expected output for the given input list."

1. Menstrual irregularities: Low body fat can disrupt the menstrual cycle, leading to irregular periods or even amenorrhea (absence of menstruation).

2. Bone health: Low body fat can lead to decreased bone density, increasing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.

3. Fertility issues: Low body fat can affect fertility, making it more difficult to conceive.

4. Nutrient deficiencies: Low body fat can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, such as iron, calcium, and vitamins.

5. Mental health: Low body fat can also lead to mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety.

6. Increased risk of injury: Low body fat can increase the risk of injury, as the body has less fat to cushion falls and protect vital organs.

7. Decreased immune function: Low body fat can weaken the immune system, making it more difficult to fight off infections and diseases.

8. Hormonal imbalances: Low body fat can lead to hormonal imbalances, such as decreased levels of estrogen and progesterone.

It's important to note that everyone's body is different, and what may be a healthy body fat percentage for one person may not be healthy for another. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to determine a healthy body fat percentage for you."

Factors of 210:
1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 30, 42, 63, 70, 105, 140, 210

Now, we square each factor:
1^2 = 1
2^2 = 4
3^2 = 9
6^2 = 36
10^2 = 100
15^2 = 225

You can run this code by saving it to a file (e.g., `main.go`) and then running the `go run` command in your terminal:

```sh
$ go run main.go

Instead, you can use the `Parent` property to access the parent object of a given instance, and then use the `Name` property to get the name of the parent object.

Here's an example of how you can use the `Parent` and `Name` properties in Luau:

```lua
local instance = game.Workspace:FindFirstChild(""InstanceName"")
local parent = instance.Parent
local parentName = parent.Name
```

In this example, we first find an instance with the name ""InstanceName"" in the `Workspace` object. Then, we get the parent object of the instance using the `Parent` property. Finally, we get the name of the parent object using the `Name` property.

If you want to access the parent object's name directly, you can use the `ParentName` property in a custom function or script that you write in Luau. However, keep in mind that this will not be a built-in property of the language, and you will need to implement it yourself.

Here's an example of how you can define a custom function to get the parent object's name in Luau:

```lua
local function getParentName(instance)
    local parent = instance.Parent
    local parentName = parent.Name
    return parentName
end
```

In this example, we define a function called `getParentName` that takes an instance as an argument. The function gets the parent object of the instance using the `Parent` property, and then gets the name of the parent object using the `Name` property. Finally, the function returns the name of the parent object.

You can use this function in your Luau scripts to get the parent object's name directly. For example:

```lua
local instance = game.Workspace:FindFirstChild(""InstanceName"")
local parentName = getParentName(instance)
```

In this example, we find an instance with the name ""InstanceName"" in the `Workspace` object, and then we use the `getParentName` function to get the name of the parent object of the instance."

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Type the following command to edit the sudoers file:

```
sudo visudo
```

3. In the sudoers file, find the line that looks like this:

```
root ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

4. Below this line, add the following line:

```
your_username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Replace ""your_username"" with your actual username.

5. Save the file and exit the editor.

6. To test the passwordless sudo, try running a command with sudo, like this:

```
sudo ls /root
```

If you've set up passwordless sudo correctly, you won't be prompted for a password.

Remember, granting passwordless sudo can be a security risk, so it's important to only do this for trusted users and only for commands that need to be run with sudo.

Also, it's a good idea to set a strong root password to prevent unauthorized access.

Lastly, it's always a good idea to keep your system up-to-date and use a firewall to protect your system from potential threats."

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy shrank by 20.4% in the second quarter of 2020, making it the worst-affected major industrial nation, with Scotland experiencing a 19.4% decline."

However, in Python 3.7 and later, you can use raw string literals (prefixing the string with `r`) to avoid the need for backslashes. So, in a raw string, you don't need to escape the `=` symbol. Here's an example:

```python
import re

# With backslashes (not a raw string)
pattern = r'=\d+'
match = re.search(pattern, 'a=123')

# With raw string
pattern = r'=\d+'
match = re.search(pattern, 'a=123')
```

In both cases, the `=` symbol is treated as a literal and not a special character. But remember, if you're using a regular expression that includes other special characters, you may still need to escape them."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that it's hard to believe that we're already more than halfway through Donald Trump's presidency. Kimmel criticized those who say Trump hasn't accomplished anything, and instead highlighted that Trump has played golf more than any other president, a total of over 70 times in just one year. Kimmel suggested that people do something positive, like signing up for health insurance during the Affordable Care Act's open-enrollment period, which is currently happening. Despite the Trump administration's efforts to undermine the plan, enrollment has actually surged. Kimmel encouraged viewers to visit Healthcare.gov to sign up for health insurance, even if they don't support Trump."

This episode delves deep into the bond between the three witches, highlighting their unwavering support for each other despite their differences.

The episode begins with the witches, Mina, Aya, and Rika, being cursed by a witch hunter. This curse causes them to lose their powers and their memories of each other. However, they manage to break the curse by working together and reaffirming their friendship.

Throughout the episode, the witches face numerous challenges that test their friendship. They are forced to confront their fears and insecurities, and they learn to trust and rely on each other. Despite their differences, they are able to find common ground and work together to overcome their obstacles.

The episode also explores the theme of empowerment. The witches are powerful beings, but they are also vulnerable. They are hunted by witch hunters, and they are forced to hide their true identities. However, they are able to find strength in their friendship and in their shared experiences. They are able to stand up for themselves and fight against those who seek to harm them.

Overall, ""The Witch's Curse"" is a powerful episode that showcases the themes of female friendship and empowerment. It is a testament to the strength of the bond between the three witches, and it is a reminder that no matter what challenges we face, we can overcome them if we work together and support each other."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

In the heart of a verdant valley, nestled between the rolling hills and the whispering winds, lies a haven of tranquility and beauty - the Willowbrook Sanctuary. This enchanting haven, a symphony of nature's splendor, has been my sanctuary, my haven of peace, and my source of endless joy.

The Willowbrook Sanctuary is a place where the air is thick with the scent of blooming flowers, where the rustling of leaves is a soothing lullaby, and where the chirping of birds is a melodious symphony. It is a place where the sun paints the sky with hues of gold and orange, and where the moon casts a silvery glow over the landscape.

The sanctuary is a sprawling expanse of lush greenery, dotted with ancient willow trees that seem to have been there since the dawn of time. Their gnarled branches stretch out like welcoming arms, offering a sense of solace and protection. The willows, with their graceful arches and their delicate, swaying leaves, are a testament to the enduring beauty of nature.

The pathways that crisscross the sanctuary are lined with vibrant flowers, their colors a riot of reds, yellows, and blues. The air is filled with the sweet scent of these blooms, a fragrance that is at once intoxicating and invigorating. The flowers, with their delicate petals and their vibrant hues, are a celebration of life and growth.

The Willowbrook Sanctuary is also home to a variety of wildlife. Deer roam freely, their graceful movements a sight to behold. Squirrels scamper up and down the trees, their tails twitching with excitement. Birds flit from branch to branch, their songs a harmonious chorus that fills the air.

The sanctuary is a place where time seems to stand still. Here, one can escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life, and find a sense of peace and serenity. It is a place where one can reconnect with nature, and find a sense of harmony and balance."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

Here's a comprehensive set of HTML data points that illustrate the different ways sleep deprivation impacts human physiology:

1. **Immune System**: `<p>Sleep deprivation weakens the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections and diseases. This is due to the reduction in the production of cytokines, which are proteins that help fight infections and inflammation.</p>`

2. **Cardiovascular Health**: `<p>Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to an increased risk of heart disease and stroke. This is because sleep deprivation can cause an increase in blood pressure, inflammation, and stress hormones, all of which can damage the cardiovascular system.</p>`

3. **Mental Health**: `<p>Sleep deprivation can lead to a variety of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and mood disorders. This is because sleep plays a crucial role in regulating emotions and maintaining mental health.</p>`

4. **Cognitive Function**: `<p>Sleep deprivation can impair cognitive function, including memory, attention, and decision-making abilities. This is because sleep is essential for the consolidation of memories and the restoration of the brain.</p>`

5. **Metabolic Health**: `<p>Sleep deprivation can lead to weight gain and an increased risk of obesity. This is because sleep deprivation can cause an increase in the production of ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates appetite, and a decrease in the production of leptin, a hormone that signals fullness.</p>`

Now, let's compare the consequences of acute versus chronic sleep deprivation on overall wellness:

- **Acute Sleep Deprivation**: This is a short-term lack of sleep, usually lasting a few days. The consequences include fatigue, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. However, these symptoms usually resolve once the individual gets enough sleep.

However, one of the most pressing issues currently is climate change.

Climate change, driven primarily by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, is causing global temperatures to rise, leading to a host of negative consequences. These include more frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes and droughts, which can devastate ecosystems and disrupt the lives of countless species.

Additionally, climate change is causing sea levels to rise, which can lead to coastal flooding and the loss of habitats for many species. It's also causing shifts in the distribution and timing of plant and animal life, which can disrupt entire ecosystems and lead to the extinction of many species.

While there are other important issues, such as habitat loss, pollution, and overexploitation of resources, climate change is a particularly pressing issue because of its global impact and the urgent need for action to mitigate its effects. It's important to note that addressing climate change will require a concerted effort from individuals, governments, and businesses around the world."

In other words, the post processor takes the generic toolpath data and converts it into a format that is specific to the machine tool's control system, including the machine's programming language, the format of the toolpath data, and the specific commands that the machine tool requires to execute the toolpath.

The post processor is an essential component of the CAD/CAM system because it ensures that the toolpath data is correctly translated into a format that the machine tool can understand and execute. Without a post processor, the toolpath data would not be able to be executed by the machine tool, and the manufacturing process would not be able to proceed.

There are many different types of post processors available, each designed to work with a specific type of machine tool. Some post processors are designed to work with a specific brand or model of machine tool, while others are designed to work with a wide range of machine tools.

In summary, a CAD/CAM post processor is a software component that translates the toolpath data generated by a CAM system into a format that a specific CNC machine tool can understand and execute. It is an essential component of the CAD/CAM system because it ensures that the toolpath data is correctly translated into a format that the machine tool can understand and execute."

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To achieve this, you can use Base64 encoding and decoding in JavaScript. Here's a simple example:

```javascript
// Encoding the string
function encodeBase64(str) {
    return btoa(str);
}

// Decoding the string
function decodeBase64(str) {
    return atob(str);
}

// Usage
const longString = ""Your long string here"";
const encodedString = encodeBase64(longString);
console.log(encodedString); // Output: Your encoded string here

// Later, when you want to decode it
const decodedString = decodeBase64(encodedString);
console.log(decodedString); // Output: Your long string here
```

This code uses the `btoa` function to encode the string and the `atob` function to decode it. These functions are supported in most modern browsers. If you need to support older browsers, you might need to use a library like `base64-js`.

Remember that Base64 encoding will increase the size of your string by about 33%, so it's not a perfect solution for extremely long strings. However, it's a good compromise between readability and size for most use cases.

Also, keep in mind that Base64 encoding is not secure by itself. If you're dealing with sensitive data, you should consider using additional security measures, such as encryption.

Lastly, if you're dealing with URLs, you might want to use percent-encoding instead of Base64 encoding for certain characters. Percent-encoding is a way to represent characters that are not allowed in URLs, such as spaces and certain punctuation marks. You can use the `encodeURIComponent` function in JavaScript to percent-encode a string."

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.

How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, follow these steps:

1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker. This includes gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, orange flower water, and cream.

2. Shake the mixture for two minutes without ice. This helps to create the ideal bloom on the drink.

5. Strain the cocktail into the Collins glass over the soda water.

6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and enjoy your perfectly crafted Ramos Gin Fizz.

Tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink:

- Dry shake first: Some bartenders prefer to dry shake the mixture (shake without ice) for a longer period of time to create a thicker foam.

- Add cream last: Adding the cream last can help to prevent it from curdling during the shaking process.

- Strain into a glass from up high: Straining the cocktail into a glass from up high can help to create a more dramatic foam.

- Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles: Using smaller ice cubes can help to create smaller bubbles, which can contribute to a better foam.

- Play with the possibilities: There are many tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. The best way to find out what works best is to play with the possibilities and experiment with different techniques."

Dr. Amelia Hartley is a brilliant and dedicated scientist who specializes in marine biology. She is passionate about her work and is determined to make a difference in the world. She is a strong advocate for conservation and is always looking for ways to protect the oceans and the creatures that live within them.

Character 2: Captain Jack ""Hammer"" Hammond
Captain Jack ""Hammer"" Hammond is a rugged and charismatic sea captain who has spent his entire life on the water. He is a skilled sailor and a master of the sea, but he is also a ruthless businessman who is always looking for ways to make a profit. He is the owner of a large fishing fleet and is always looking for new opportunities to expand his business.

Conflict:
The conflict between Dr. Amelia Hartley and Captain Jack ""Hammer"" Hammond arises when they come into contact with a rare and valuable species of fish that is found only in the deepest parts of the ocean. Dr. Hartley is determined to study the fish and learn more about its biology and behavior, while Captain Hammond sees it as a potential gold mine and wants to catch as many of the fish as possible to sell on the black market.

The conflict between the two characters escalates when Dr. Hartley discovers that Captain Hammond is using illegal and destructive methods to catch the fish, including the use of explosives and the destruction of sensitive marine habitats. Dr. Hartley is horrified by Captain Hammond's actions and is determined to stop him from destroying the ocean and the creatures that live within it.

The conflict between Dr. Hartley and Captain Hammond reaches a climax when they are both stranded on a remote island after their ship is wrecked in a storm. Dr. Hartley is determined to find a way to survive and to protect the island's fragile ecosystem, while Captain Hammond is only interested in finding a way to escape and to continue his destructive activities.

In the end, Dr. Hartley is able to convince Captain Hammond to change his ways and to work together to protect the island and its inhabitants. The two characters learn to respect each other and to work together for the greater good, and they become unlikely allies in the fight to protect"

Here's a simplified breakdown of the process:

1. Application: The supplier must first submit an application to EASA, providing detailed information about their organization, products, and processes.

2. Initial Assessment: EASA will review the application and conduct an initial assessment to ensure the supplier meets the necessary requirements. This includes checking the supplier's quality management system, production processes, and compliance with relevant regulations.

3. On-site Inspection: If the initial assessment is positive, EASA will conduct an on-site inspection to verify the information provided in the application. This inspection will cover various aspects of the supplier's operations, including their facilities, equipment, and personnel.

4. Evaluation: Based on the findings from the on-site inspection, EASA will evaluate the supplier's compliance with the necessary requirements. This evaluation will consider factors such as the supplier's ability to consistently produce quality products, their adherence to safety standards, and their overall suitability as a supplier for the PO.

5. Approval or Rejection: After the evaluation, EASA will decide whether to approve or reject the supplier. If the supplier is approved, they will be added to EASA's list of approved suppliers. If the supplier is rejected, they will be required to address any issues identified during the evaluation before they can be considered for approval.

6. Ongoing Monitoring: Once a supplier is approved, they will be subject to ongoing monitoring by EASA to ensure they continue to meet the necessary requirements. This monitoring will include regular inspections and evaluations to ensure the supplier's continued compliance.

7. Renewal: The approval of a supplier is valid for a certain period, after which it needs to be renewed. The renewal process is similar to the initial approval process, with the supplier being required to demonstrate their continued compliance with the necessary requirements.

This process ensures that only suppliers who meet the necessary requirements are approved, and that these suppliers are subject to ongoing monitoring to ensure their continued compliance. This helps to maintain the high safety standards required in the aviation industry."

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.

Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","Congham Hall Hotel stands out from other hotels in the area due to its unique ambiance and exceptional dining options. The hotel is nestled in the picturesque countryside of North-West Norfolk, offering a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of city life.

Upon arrival, guests are greeted with a warm welcome and shown to their spacious, stylish rooms, many of which boast sash windows with views of the surrounding countryside. The hotel's Georgian mansion has been tastefully updated while retaining its traditional charm, with modern amenities and luxurious touches.

These differences can be influenced by factors such as climate, vegetation, and the presence of host animals.

For example, Tabanus species in tropical regions may have more continuous flight patterns due to the warm climate and abundant vegetation. In contrast, Tabanus species in temperate regions may have more seasonal flight patterns, with activity peaking during the warmer months.

Additionally, the presence of host animals can influence the flight patterns of Tabanus. For example, Tabanus species that prefer to feed on large mammals such as horses or cattle may have flight patterns that are more closely tied to the movement and behavior of these animals.

Overall, while there can be differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different regions, it is important to note that these patterns can be influenced by a variety of factors, and further research is needed to fully understand the factors that influence the flight patterns of Tabanus in different regions."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.

Student:","Passage 3 contains the information about Philippe, who served under the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. However, it does not provide the number of kings that Hungary had before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law. Therefore, Passage 3 cannot be used to answer the question."
