## How Housing Developments Can Be Designed to Be More Sustainable

**1. Energy-Efficient Design:**

* Use passive house design principles to reduce energy consumption.
* Incorporate natural light and ventilation systems to reduce the need for artificial light and heat.
* Design homes with renewable energy sources, such as solar panels and wind turbines.
* Implement smart home automation systems to control lighting, heating, and cooling efficiently.

**2. Sustainable Materials:**

* Use recycled or sustainably harvested materials, such as wood, brick, and recycled glass.
* Incorporate durable and long-lasting materials that require less replacement.
* Use low-VOC materials to improve indoor air quality.

**3. Water Conservation:**

* Implement water-saving fixtures and appliances.
* Use rainwater harvesting techniques to collect and reuse water.
* Design homes to reduce water usage through sustainable landscaping practices.

**4. Resource Conservation:**

* Use sustainable building practices, such as LEED certification.
* Reduce waste production and promote recycling and composting.
* Incorporate green spaces, such as parks and community gardens, into the design.

**5. Healthy Indoor Air:**

* Use natural ventilation systems to improve air circulation.
* Install air purifiers to remove dust and allergens.
* Incorporate plants into the design to improve air quality and reduce stress.

**6. Community Integration:**

* Design homes that foster a sense of community.
* Incorporate shared spaces and amenities, such as community kitchens and lounges.
* Encourage social interaction and reduce the need for travel.

**7. Long-Term Durability:**

* Use durable materials and construction techniques to extend the lifespan of the home.
* Design homes to withstand the test of time and extreme weather conditions.
* Incorporate flexible design elements that allow for future adaptations.

**Conclusion:**

By incorporating these sustainable design principles, housing developments can be designed to be more energy-efficient, water-conscious, resource-conserving, and healthy for residents. By prioritizing sustainability throughout the design process, we can create homes that are not only environmentally friendly but also more comfortable, healthy, and resilient.","## How Housing Developments Can Be Designed to Be More Sustainable

why I get 404 error running docker-compose uo
model
A 404 error while running `docker-compose up` typically indicates an issue with the reverse proxy setup. Here are some potential reasons why this might be happening:

**Common causes:**

* **Reverse proxy settings:** The reverse proxy settings in your `docker-compose.yml` file might be incorrect.
* **DNS resolution:** The DNS resolution might not be working properly.
* **Localhost vs. Docker host:** You might be confusing the local host with the Docker host.

**Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot:**

1. **Check the `docker-compose.yml` file:**
    * Ensure the `volumes` section is defined properly.
    * Check if the `ports` section maps the ports correctly.
    * Review the `environment` section to see if any variables are missing.
    * Ensure the `depends_on` section is pointing to the correct services.
2. **Check the DNS:**
    * Verify if the DNS server is running and accessible.
    * Ensure the DNS server's IP address is correct in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
    * Try resolving the domain name on the local machine to confirm it's resolving correctly.
3. **Distinguish the local host from the Docker host:**
    * Ensure the `docker-compose up -p` command is using the correct ports.
    * Check if the `docker-compose up -p` command is using the Docker host IP address.

**Additional resources:**

* **Troubleshooting:** `docker-compose` documentation -

    * [Community documentation](/t/docker-compose/troubleshooting)
* **Docker Compose Error Codes:** List of common Docker Compose error codes - 
    * [Official documentation](/en/reference/commandline/docker-compose/error-codes)

Sure, here's the answer to your question:

To improve the air quality in your office, you could consider adding plants that purify the air. Here are some plants that are known for their air-purifying abilities:

* **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)**
* **English Ivy (Hedera helix)**
* **Chinese Money Plant (Pilea peperomioides)**
* **Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)**
* **ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia)**

These plants are low-maintenance and thrive in low-light conditions, making them perfect for an office environment. To maximize their air-purifying benefits, it is recommended to group several plants together in a central location in the office. This will help to increase the overall air-purifying effect.","Sure, here's the answer to your question:

## Solution

This problem asks us to take a list of lists, find the odd numbers in each inner list, multiply them by the number of elements in the inner list, and then combine the results into a new list.

Here's the solution:

1. **Identify the odd numbers:**
   - For each inner list, identify the numbers that are not even. These numbers will be our focus for the next step.
2. **Multiply by the number of elements:**
   - Once the odd numbers are identified, multiply each number by the number of elements in the inner list. This will give us the product of each odd number by the number of elements in the inner list.
3. **Combine the results:**
   - Finally, combine the results from each inner list into a new list. This will be the output list.

**Example:**

In the example provided, the following is the solution:

- The first inner list has no odd numbers, therefore the output is 0.
- The second inner list has -9, 5, -1 as odd numbers, so the output is 45.
- The third inner list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers, so the output is -135.

**Applying the solution to the problem:**

**Step 1:** Identify the odd numbers in each inner list.

- [[40, -36, 45, -47] - odd numbers: none]
- [-7, 39, 4, 23] - odd numbers: -7, 39
- [-26, -3, 32, 1] - odd numbers: none
- [-3, 20, -14, -38] - odd numbers: -3, 20
- [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49] - odd numbers: none
- [-19, 28, -39] - odd numbers: -19, 28

**Step 2:** Multiply each odd number by the number of elements in the inner list.

- [[40, -36, 45, -47] - no multiplication]
- [-7, 39, 4, 23] - multiplication","## Solution

    fmt.Printf(""The product of %d, %d, and %d is %d.\n"", primes[0], primes[1], primes[2], product)
}
```

This code calculates the product of the three primes and prints the result.

**Explanation:**

* The code imports the `fmt` package for formatting output.
* It defines a slice `primes` of three prime numbers: 1009, 1013, and 1019.
* It initializes a variable `product` to 1.
* It iterates over the `primes` slice using a `range primes` loop.
* Inside the loop, it multiplies `product` by the current prime in the loop.
* After the loop, it prints the product using `fmt.Printf`.

**Output:**

```
The product of 1009, 1013, and 1019 is 103219.
```

This output shows that the product of the three primes is 103219.","```go
package main

import fmt

func main() {
    primes := []int{1009, 1013, 1019}
    product := 1
    for _, prime := range primes {
        product *= prime
    }
    fmt.Printf(""The product of %d, %d, and %d is %d.\n"", primes[0], primes[1], primes[2], product)

How to use passwordless sudo in Linux?
model
**Using Passwordless sudo in Linux without a password:**

**Requirements:**

* Ubuntu or Debian-based system
* Sudo command-line tool installed

**Steps:**

1. **Enable sudo without password:**
```
sudo visudo -b
```

2. **Set a default PIN:**
```
sudo visudo -c ""default""
```
Enter a PIN of your choice.

3. **Confirm PIN:**
```
sudo visudo -c ""default""
```
Enter the same PIN you set in the previous step.

**Using sudo without a password:**

To use sudo without a password, simply type the following command:

```
sudo -i pin
```

where ""pin"" is the PIN you set in step 2.

**Additional notes:**

* You will need to authenticate with your PIN when you use `sudo` commands.
* The PIN is stored encrypted in the system, so it is not visible to others.
* You can change your PIN at any time using the `sudo visudo -c ""default""` command.
* It is not recommended to use passwordless sudo for extended periods of time, as it can be less secure.

**Example usage:**

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install firefox
```

**Important security warning:**

Using passwordless sudo can be convenient, but it also poses a security risk. Anyone with access to the system can potentially use `sudo` commands without authorization.

## Analysis

The text presents three separate scenarios and draws incorrect conclusions based on those scenarios.

**1. Young polo player wearing an orange jersey riding a horse:**

The text incorrectly assumes that wearing an orange jersey is synonymous with playing polo. This is inaccurate. The text does not provide information about the polo player's actions or the context in which the scene takes place, therefore the text does not support the hypothesis.

**2. Large black dog chasing a small black dog:**

The text correctly identifies two dogs chasing each other. However, it does not provide information about the context of the scene or the actions of the dogs, therefore the text does not support the hypothesis.

**3. Two girls playing in a tunnel:**

The text does not provide sufficient information about the scene or the actions of the girls, therefore the text does not support the hypothesis.

**Overall:**

The text draws inaccurate conclusions based on the provided scenarios. It lacks the necessary information to determine whether the hypotheses are true or not. The text does not provide enough context or details about the scenarios to draw the stated conclusions.","## Analysis

## Text Augmentation and Classification with Keras

**Data Preparation:**

1. **Data Loading:**
```python
# Assuming you have the data loaded already
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
```

2. **Text Augmentation:**
```python
# Text Scaling
data['text'] = data['text'].apply(lambda x: x.upper())

# Random Sampling
data_augmented = pd.concat([data.sample(frac=0.2) for _ in range(10)])
```

**Model Building:**

1. **Model Definition:**
```python
model = keras.models.load_model('model.h5.h5')
```

2. **Model Fine-tuning:**
```python
model.layers[1].add(keras.layers.SpatialDropout1D(0.2))
model.layers[2].activation = keras.activations.LeakyReLU()
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(data_augmented, epochs=5, validation_data=data)
```

**Model Evaluation:**

```python
model.evaluate(data, verbose=2)
```

**Final Notes:**

* The text augmentation techniques like uppercasing, random sampling, and data shuffling are applied to the training data to improve model generalization ability.
* The model is fine-tuned using the `model.layers[1].add` method to add a dropout layer and changing the activation function to Leaky ReLU.
* The model is then fit on the augmented data, and its performance is evaluated on the validation data.

**Additional Tips:**

* Experiment with different augmentation techniques and parameters to find the best performing model.
* Use early stopping techniques to prevent overfitting.
* Consider using pre-trained models to improve performance.

**By following these steps, you can effectively augment your text data and classify it using Keras.**","## Text Augmentation and Classification with Keras

## ""The One with the Dragon Stone"" (S02E08) is considered by many to best showcase the themes of female friendship and empowerment in ""Friends.""

**Here's why:**

* **Empowerment through vulnerability:** The characters in the episode confront their vulnerabilities and fears, empowering each other to overcome challenges. Monica's struggle with OCD and Rachel's battle with self-doubt are prime examples.
* **Supporting each other:** The characters actively support and encourage each other, even during difficult times. Phoebe's pep talk to Monica in ""The One with the Morning Breath"" exemplifies this.
* **Standing their ground:** Despite facing adversity and personal struggles, the characters maintain their strength and resilience. They don't shy away from seeking support or backing down others.

The episode also explores themes of forgiveness, second chances, and self-discovery, further highlighting the strength and resilience of the characters.

Therefore, ""The One with the Dragon Stone"" effectively showcases the themes of female friendship and empowerment through its portrayal of strong, vulnerable, and resilient characters who support and empower one another. It also serves as a reminder that everyone struggles with personal demons, but through friendship and strength, anyone can overcome challenges.","## ""The One with the Dragon Stone"" (S02E08) is considered by many to best showcase the themes of female friendship and empowerment in ""Friends.""

## Analysis of the student's language inference questions

This text presents a series of questions where the student struggles to understand the relationship between sentences and draw inferences. Each question involves a different type of inference:

**1. Spatial inference:**
- **Student's question:** ""Three women standing in the water beside a beach.""
- **Teacher's response:** ""The desert does not have beaches with large bodies of water."" The women cannot stand by a beach and in the middle of the desert.

**2. Causal inference:**
- **Student's question:** Test for natural language inference.
- **Teacher's response:** ""Subject could be either a crowd of several people or some monkeys. The answer is no.""

**3. Generalization:**
- **Student's question:** Can we conclude from ""A girl in the park is taking a picture."" that ""A girl taking pictures of a chair in the kitchen.""
- **Teacher's response:** ""A girl cannot simultaneously be taking pictures of a chair in the kitchen and be in the park."" The answer is no.

**4. Compositionality:**
- **Student's question:** If ""A man in an orange shirt is sitting at a table and eating a french fry dipped in dressing with chopsticks."" does that mean that ""A man is eating a french fry""?
- **Teacher's response:** ""The text does not describe the food the man is eating. Therefore, I cannot answer this question."" The answer is it is not possible to tell.

Overall, the student's struggles with making inferences are due to her limited understanding of the relationship between sentences and the need for additional information to draw inferences. The teacher's responses provide explanations and clarifications, but do not necessarily answer the questions fully. This is because the text does not provide enough information to draw concrete inferences, and some questions involve complex concepts like compositionality and generalizability that require more information than the text can provide.","## Analysis of the student's language inference questions

Your task is to generate the fill-in-the-blank question for this answer based on the given article.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

The scent of warm, freshly brewed coffee permeates the air, mingling with the sweet aroma of cinnamon and honey. The sun shines warmly on your face as you gaze out at the vibrant, colorful tapestry of the marketplace. The air crackles with the energy of haggling vendors, each one vying for your business.

The sights and sounds of the marketplace are a symphony of life. Baskets groan with fresh produce, the pungent aroma of spices fills the air, and the chatter of vendors echoes through the aisles. The vibrant colours of the produce dance in the sunlight, a kaleidoscope of flavour and aroma.

The air is thick with the scent of fresh bread and spices, the soundtrack of the marketplace a constant hum and chatter. Yet, amidst the clamor and the crowd, there is a sense of peace and tranquility.

In the heart of the marketplace, a lone vendor sits, meticulously arranging his meticulously chosen collection of antique coins. He gazes at the customer with a knowing smile, a guardian of treasures and stories.

The marketplace is a kaleidoscope of senses - a sensory paradise where sights, smells, and sounds intertwine to create a unique and unforgettable experience. It is a place where cultures collide and traditions dance, a vibrant tapestry woven from the threads of diversity and resilience.

As you leave the marketplace, the scent of coffee and cinnamon fades, but the memories linger. You carry a piece of the marketplace within you, a souvenir of the sights, smells, and sounds that filled your senses.

And so, you return year after year, drawn by the irresistible allure of the marketplace, a place where life unfolds in a symphony of senses, where stories are whispered in the air, and where the spirit of the community thrives.","The scent of warm, freshly brewed coffee permeates the air, mingling with the sweet aroma of cinnamon and honey.

## Data Exchange Between Companies using Azure Storage Queues

**Components:**

* **Two Azure Storage Queues:** Company A and Company B
* **Event Hub:** Acts as an intermediary between the queues, facilitating data exchange
* **Event Hub Connection:** Connects the Event Hub to both Company A and Company B

**Data Flow:**

1. **Event Hub publishes:**
    - Company A sends data to Company B through the Event Hub connection.
    - Data is published to Company B's Event Hub endpoint.

2. **Company B receives:**
    - Company B subscribes to Company A's Event Hub endpoint.
    - Company B receives data from Company A through the Event Hub endpoint.

**Benefits:**

* **Loose coupling:** Companies A and B are loosely coupled, as they only interact through the Event Hub.
* **Scalability:** Event Hub scales horizontally across multiple regions, allowing for data exchange between many companies.
* **Reliability:** Event Hub guarantees delivery and ordering of events, ensuring data consistency.
* **Security:** Event Hub offers security features such as authorization and encryption.

**Drawbacks:**

* **Latency:** Data transfer between queues and Event Hub can introduce latency, depending on the volume and frequency of data exchange.
* **Cost:** Event Hub can incur additional costs compared to direct queue-to-queue communication.
* **Complexity:** Setting up and managing the Event Hub connection can be more complex than direct queue-to-queue communication.

**Implementation:**

1. Set up Event Hub endpoints in both Company A and Company B.
2. Configure Company A to publish data to Company B's Event Hub endpoint.
3. Company B subscribes to Company A's Event Hub endpoint to receive data.
4. Data flow between companies begins.

**Additional Notes:**

* The above design assumes that both companies have Azure subscriptions to Event Hub.
* Data format and security settings can be customized based on specific needs.
* Monitoring and alerting can be implemented on both Company A and Company B.

**Overall, Azure Storage Queues and Event Hub can be a powerful solution for data exchange between companies, offering increased scalability, reliability, and security.**","## Data Exchange Between Companies using Azure Storage Queues

* The admin must not print the ""statement"" before all pre-questions have been asked.
* The ""statement"" summarizes the chosen options and their outcomes, including the name of the chosen tool and character.
* The player cannot use tools that they did not choose in the pre-questions.

**Ending:**

* After completing all main-questions, the admin prints the ending of the story.

```python
import hashlib

# Long string
long_string = ""This is a long string that is up to 100 characters long. It has a lot of information and is very long.""

# Hashing the long string
long_string_hash = hashlib.sha256(long_string).hexdigest()

# Short string
short_string = hashlib.sha256(long_string_hash).hexdigest()

# Sharing the short string
print(short_string)
```

**Explanation:**

* The `hashlib` library is used for hashing the strings.
* The `sha256()` function is used to hash the long string.
* The `hexdigest()` method returns a hexadecimal hash of the hashed string.
* The short string is created by hashing the long string hash.
* The short string is shared.

**Decoding the shared string:**

```python
# Receiving the short string
short_string_received = input(""Enter the shared string: "")

# Converting the short string back to a hash
long_string_hash = hashlib.sha256(short_string_received).hexdigest()

# Checking if the decoded string is equal to the original long string
if long_string_hash == long_string_hash:
    print(""The strings are equal."")
else:
    print(""The strings are not equal."")
```

**Example Usage:**

```
# Hashing and sharing the long string
long_string = ""This is a long string that is up to 100 characters long. It has a lot of information and is very long.""
short_string = hashlib.sha256(long_string).hexdigest()

if long_string_hash == long_string_hash:
    print(""The strings are equal."")
else:
    print(""The strings are not equal."")

* The maximum length of the long string is 100 characters.
* The hashing algorithm used in this code is SHA-256.

## The Two Characters

**1. Seraphina (The Advocate)**

- A passionate and headstrong social worker, championing equality and justice.
- Stands firmly against oppression and discrimination, fighting for those marginalized.
- Has a strong moral compass, guided by empathy and courage.

**2. Bartholomew (The Oppressor)**

- A cold-hearted and cunning politician, exploiting power and control.
- Maintains a system of oppression, maintaining his grip on power.
- Uses fear and manipulation to maintain control, often resorting to violence.

**The Conflict:**

Seraphina and Bartholomew represent opposing forces in a conflict rooted in their differing ideologies and approaches to society.

* **Seraphina challenges Bartholomew's oppression:** She challenges his tactics and refuses to be silenced.
* **Bartholomew attempts to maintain control:** He uses his power to maintain control over Seraphina and others who oppose him.

**The Plot:**

The conflict escalates as Bartholomew uses his influence to suppress dissent, leading to a power struggle. Seraphina, unwilling to submit, rallies support from allies and challenges Bartholomew's authority.

**The Climax:**

The conflict climaxes with a struggle for power and control. Seraphina and her allies confront Bartholomew and his supporters in a final showdown.

**The Resolution:**

Could you explain me how the Production Organisations Approval (EASA) evaluate each supplier they work with?
model
The Production Organisations Approval System (EASA) evaluates each supplier through a series of steps, which can vary slightly depending on the country of the supplier. Here's a general overview:

**1. Initial Assessment:**
- The supplier submits a self-assessment questionnaire and other required documentation.
- The information is reviewed by the supplier's quality department and sometimes by a third-party auditor.

**2. Document Review:**
- The supplier's quality department reviews the documentation for completeness and accuracy.
- The documentation is reviewed by the purchasing department for compliance with EASA requirements.

**3. Audit:**
- The supplier may undergo an audit by a third-party auditor.
- The auditor assesses the supplier's quality management system and its ability to meet EASA requirements.

**4. Approval:**
- If the auditor finds the supplier meets all requirements, the supplier is approved and a purchase order is placed.
- The supplier is issued a certificate of approval.

**Additional Requirements:**

- **Country-Specific Requirements:** Some countries have additional requirements for imported goods. For example, the EU has specific regulations for food safety and environmental protection.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** After approval, the supplier is monitored regularly to ensure it continues to meet EASA requirements. This may include audits, reviews of documentation, and other measures.

**Timeline:**

- The entire EASA process can take several months, depending on the complexity of the supplier and the country of origin.
- The time frame for each stage can vary, but the overall process typically takes 4-6 weeks for a new supplier and 2-4 weeks for a re-approval.

**Overall, the EASA process is designed to ensure that suppliers meet the required quality standards and that they are able to consistently produce high-quality goods.**","The Production Organisations Approval System (EASA) evaluates each supplier through a series of steps, which can vary slightly depending on the country of the supplier.

Sure, here is the answer to the question:

Yes, there are differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different regions. Here are some of the key differences:

**1. Flight Path:**

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
