1. Energy Efficiency: Buildings can be designed to use less energy by incorporating energy-efficient materials, appliances, and systems. This can include using insulation to reduce heat loss, installing energy-efficient windows, and using energy-efficient lighting and appliances.
2. Water Conservation: Housing developments can be designed to use less water by incorporating water-efficient fixtures, appliances, and landscaping. This can include using low-flow showerheads, dual-flush toilets, and water-efficient irrigation systems.
3. Green Spaces: Housing developments can be designed to include green spaces, such as parks, gardens, and green roofs. These spaces can help to reduce heat island effect, improve air quality, and provide opportunities for recreation and relaxation.
4. Transportation: Housing developments can be designed to encourage the use of public transportation, walking, and cycling. This can include providing easy access to public transportation, creating safe and convenient walking and cycling routes, and incorporating bike storage facilities.
5. Waste Management: Housing developments can be designed to reduce waste by incorporating recycling and composting facilities, and by using materials that are recyclable or biodegradable.
6. Health and Well-being: Housing developments can be designed to promote health and well-being by incorporating features such as natural light, fresh air, and green spaces. This can help to reduce stress, improve mood, and promote physical activity.
7. Community Engagement: Housing developments can be designed to promote community engagement by incorporating shared spaces, such as community gardens, playgrounds, and meeting spaces. This can help to foster a sense of community and promote social interaction.

Overall, sustainable housing developments should be designed to minimize their environmental impact, promote health and well-being, and encourage sustainable living practices."

As a general rule of thumb, you should aim to have at least one plant per 100 square feet of space in your office. However, this is just a rough estimate, and the actual number of plants you need may vary depending on the specific conditions in your office.

Here are some tips to help you determine the number of plants you need:

1. Measure the size of your closet office: To determine the number of plants you need, you'll need to know the size of your office in square feet. Measure the length and width of your office, and then multiply the two numbers to get the total square footage.
2. Choose the right plants: Not all plants are created equal when it comes to air purification. Some plants, like the snake plant and the spider plant, are known for their ability to remove toxins from the air. Other plants, like the peace lily and the Boston fern, are also effective at purifying the air.
3. Consider the level of air pollution: If you live in an area with high levels of air pollution, you may need more plants to effectively purify the air in your office. If you live in a less polluted area, you may be able to get away with fewer plants.
4. Keep in mind the maintenance requirements: Some plants require more care and attention than others. If you're not sure how much time you'll be able to devote to caring for your plants, you may want to choose plants that are known for their low maintenance requirements.

Ultimately, the number of plants you need to put in your closet office to breathe clean air will depend on a variety of factors. By following the tips above, you can get a better idea of how many plants you'll need to achieve optimal air quality in your office."

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]
Student:","Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's the solution:

[0, 45, -135, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here's the reasoning behind the solution:

* The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0.
* The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers, so the second output is 45.
* The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers, so the third output is -135.
* The fourth list has -3, 20, -14, -38 as even numbers, so the fourth output is 0.
* The fifth list has -20, -26, -30, -46, -49 as even numbers, so the fifth output is 0.
* The sixth list has -19, 28, -39 as even numbers, so the sixth output is 0.
* The seventh list has 43, 8 as even numbers, so the seventh output is 0.
* The eighth list has -44, -16, 29 as even numbers, so the eighth output is 0.
* The ninth list has -50, -5, 30, -49 as even numbers, so the ninth output is 0.
* The tenth list has -11, 3, 27, 34, -45 as even numbers, so the tenth output is 0.
* The eleventh list has 23, -44, -39 as even numbers, so the eleventh output is 0.
* The twelfth list has 10, 39, 39 as even numbers, so the twelfth output is 0.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."

A healthy body fat percentage for women is generally considered to be between 20% and 30%. If a woman's body fat percentage falls below 16%, she may be at risk of developing health problems related to low body fat, such as:

* Menstrual irregularities or cessation
* Osteoporosis
* Infertility
* Weakened immune system
* Increased risk of injury
* Fatigue
* Cold intolerance
* Hair loss
* Dry skin
* Mood changes

It's important to note that body fat percentage is just one factor that contributes to overall health and well-being. Other factors, such as diet, exercise, and genetics, also play a role in a person's health. If you're concerned about your body fat percentage, it's a good idea to speak with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian for personalized advice and guidance."

Note that this code will only work if the prime numbers are larger than 1000. If you want to calculate the product of three prime numbers that are smaller than 1000, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.

Here are the bullet points for each element of the market, along with a table that compares the healthcare market to a perfect market:

* **Competition:** In a perfect market, there are many buyers and sellers, and no one has any special advantages over the others. In the healthcare market, there are often only a few providers, and they may have special advantages, such as being the only provider in a certain area or having a reputation for excellence.
* **Information:** In a perfect market, buyers and sellers have perfect information about the products and prices. In the healthcare market, buyers may not have perfect information about the quality of care or the prices of different providers.
* **Barriers to entry:** In a perfect market, there are no barriers to entry, so anyone can enter the market and compete with existing providers. In the healthcare market, there may be barriers to entry, such as licensing requirements or high startup costs.
* **Product differentiation:** In a perfect market, all products are identical, so buyers can easily compare them and choose the best one. In the healthcare market, products are often differentiated by factors such as location, reputation, and specialties.
* **Price discrimination:** In a perfect market, prices are the same for all buyers. In the healthcare market, prices may be different for different buyers, such as those with insurance versus those without.
* **Externalities:** In a perfect market, there are no externalities, such as pollution or noise, that affect the market. In the healthcare market, there may be externalities, such as the cost of treating illnesses that are caused by pollution or noise.

Here is a table that compares the healthcare market to a perfect market:

In Luau, you can use the `v.ParentName` property to access the name of the parent object of a given object. This property is useful when you want to access the name of the parent object of an object that you are working with.

Here is an example of how you can use the `v.ParentName` property in Luau:
```
let obj = {
  name: ""John"",
  age: 30,
  parent: {
    name: ""Jane"",
    age: 28
  }
};

console.log(obj.v.ParentName); // Output: ""Jane""
```
In this example, we have an object `obj` with a `parent` property that contains another object. We can use the `v.ParentName` property to access the name of the parent object, which is ""Jane"" in this case.

Note that the `v.ParentName` property is not a standard property in Luau, and it may not be supported in all browsers. If you encounter any issues or errors when using this property, you may need to use a different approach to access the parent object's name.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

This can be useful for automating tasks or for users who frequently need to perform administrative tasks.

To enable passwordless sudo, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Type the following command and press Enter:
```
sudo visudo
```
This will open the sudoers file in the default text editor.

3. Scroll down to the line that starts with `root` and add the following line below it:
```
root ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```
This line grants root access to all users on all hosts without requiring a password.

4. Save the file and exit the text editor.
5. Test the passwordless sudo by typing the following command and pressing Enter:
```
sudo -l
```
This will display a list of commands that the user can execute with root privileges.

6. To execute a command with root privileges, simply prefix it with `sudo` and press Enter. For example:
```
sudo apt-get update
```
This will update the system's package list without requiring a password.

Note: Enabling passwordless sudo can be a security risk, as it allows anyone with access to the system to execute commands with root privileges. It is recommended to use this feature with caution and to limit its use to trusted users."

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy shrank by 20.4% in April, May, and June, with Scotland experiencing a 19.4% decline, making it the worst-affected major industrial nation in the first half of 2020. All industries contracted in Scotland, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The rebound forecast for next year is 7.6% growth, but it may not be enough to make up for the losses in 2020."

The `=` symbol is not a special character in regex, so it can be used as is. However, if you want to use it as a literal character in a regex pattern, you can escape it using a backslash (`\`). For example:
```python
import re

pattern = r'=.*'
match = re.search(pattern, 'a=b')

if match:
    print('Match found:', match.group())
else:
    print('No match found.')
```
In this example, the `=` symbol is used as a literal character in the regex pattern `=.*`. The backslash before the `=` symbol is used to escape it, so that it is treated as a literal character instead of a special character.

However, if you want to use the `=` symbol as a special character in a regex pattern, you will need to escape it using a backslash. For example:
```python
import re

pattern = r'=.*'
match = re.search(pattern, 'a=b')

if match:
    print('Match found:', match.group())
else:
    print('No match found.')
```
In this example, the `=` symbol is used as a special character in the regex pattern `=.*`. The backslash before the `=` symbol is used to escape it, so that it is treated as a special character instead of a literal character.

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that Donald Trump has played golf more than any other president in history, which is a significant accomplishment in itself. However, Kimmel also criticized Trump's lack of accomplishments in other areas, such as healthcare. He encouraged viewers to sign up for the Affordable Care Act's open-enrollment period, which is currently happening, and highlighted the benefits of the plan, such as covering pre-existing conditions and having no lifetime caps. Kimmel also noted that Trump's efforts to undermine the plan have backfired, with sign-up surging."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

It's a place where time seems to slow down, and the hustle and bustle of city life are a distant memory.

As I walk through the town, I am greeted by the warm, friendly faces of the locals. They always have a kind word to say, and a smile to share. The town is filled with charming, cobblestone streets, lined with beautiful, old-world buildings. The air is fresh and crisp, and the scent of blooming flowers fills the air.

One of my favorite spots in the town is a small, family-owned bakery. The aroma of freshly baked bread and pastries wafts through the air, making my mouth water. I always treat myself to a warm, flaky croissant, still hot from the oven. The taste is heavenly, and the warmth of the pastry brings a sense of comfort and happiness.

Another place that brings me joy is the town's beautiful park. It's a peaceful oasis, filled with lush greenery and colorful flowers. The park is home to a variety of wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and even the occasional deer. I love to sit on a bench, surrounded by nature, and watch the world go by.

The town's annual festival is another highlight. It's a celebration of the town's rich history and culture. The streets are filled with vendors selling local crafts, food, and drinks. There are live music performances, parades, and even a traditional dance competition. The festival is a time for the community to come together and celebrate their shared heritage.

The town's people are what make it so special. They are warm, welcoming, and always willing to lend a helping hand. They take pride in their town and are passionate about preserving its history and traditions.

I feel a sense of peace and contentment when I'm in this town. It's a place where I can escape the stresses of everyday life and just be myself. It's a place that brings me joy, and I feel grateful to have it in my life."

Here's a conceptual design for data exchange between two companies using Azure Storage Queues:

1. **Data Source**: The first company will generate data that needs to be shared with the second company. This data can be in any format, such as CSV, JSON, or XML.
2. **Azure Storage Queues**: The first company will create an Azure Storage Queue and add the data to it. This queue will act as a buffer between the two companies, ensuring that the data is not lost or corrupted during transmission.
3. **Azure Functions**: The second company will create an Azure Function that listens for new messages in the queue. When a new message is added, the function will process the data and store it in a database or another storage system.
4. **Data Consumption**: The second company can then consume the data as needed, either by querying the database or by using the data to power their own applications.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of each step:

1. **Data Source**: The first company can generate data in a variety of ways, such as through a web application, a mobile app, or a data pipeline. The data can be in any format, such as CSV, JSON, or XML.
2. **Azure Storage Queues**: The first company will create an Azure Storage Queue and add the data to it. This queue will act as a buffer between the two companies, ensuring that the data is not lost or corrupted during transmission. The queue can be configured to have a maximum size, so that it doesn't become too large and slow down the system.
3. **Azure Functions**: The second company will create an Azure Function that listens for new messages in the queue. When a new message is added, the function will process the data and store it in a database or another storage system. The function can be configured to run on a schedule, so that it checks the queue regularly for new messages.
4. **Data Consumption**: The second company can then consume the data as needed, either by querying the database or by using the data to power their own applications. The data can be used for a variety of purposes, such as for analytics, reporting, or machine learning.

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

Can you provide a comprehensive set of HTML data points that illustrate the different ways sleep deprivation impacts human physiology? Additionally, please include a comparative analysis of the consequences of acute versus chronic sleep deprivation on overall wellness.","Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

Sleep deprivation can have a significant impact on both physical and mental health. Here are some of the long-term implications of sleep deprivation:

1. Increased risk of chronic diseases: Sleep deprivation has been linked to an increased risk of developing chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. This is because sleep deprivation can disrupt the body's metabolism and hormone production, leading to weight gain and other health problems.
2. Decreased immune function: Sleep is essential for the immune system to function properly. When we don't get enough sleep, our immune system becomes weakened, making us more susceptible to infections and illnesses.
3. Mental health problems: Sleep deprivation can lead to a range of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline. This is because sleep is essential for the brain to function properly, and when we don't get enough sleep, our brain doesn't have the energy it needs to function optimally.
4. Increased risk of accidents: Sleep deprivation can also increase the risk of accidents, both on the job and on the road. This is because sleep deprivation can impair our ability to concentrate and make decisions, leading to mistakes and accidents.

Here are some HTML data points that illustrate the different ways sleep deprivation impacts human physiology:

1. Sleep deprivation can lead to weight gain: Sleep deprivation can disrupt the body's metabolism, leading to weight gain. This is because sleep deprivation can increase levels of ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates appetite, and decrease levels of leptin, a hormone that signals fullness.

Climate change is caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, causing the Earth's temperature to rise. This rise in temperature is causing a variety of negative effects, including more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and the loss of biodiversity.

Climate change is a global problem that affects everyone on Earth. It is not just an issue for people in developing countries or for future generations. It is a problem that is happening now, and it is affecting people all over the world. Climate change is a complex issue that requires a global response. It is not something that can be solved by one country or one person. It requires a coordinated effort from governments, businesses, and individuals all over the world.

There are many things that can be done to address climate change. One of the most important things is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This can be done by transitioning to renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, and by improving energy efficiency. It is also important to protect and restore forests, which absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"In JavaScript, you can use Base64 encoding and decoding to achieve this. Base64 encoding is a type of encoding that converts binary data into ASCII text. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Encoding the string:**

```javascript
let longString = ""Your long string here"";
let encodedString = btoa(longString);
```

The `btoa()` function is used to encode a string into Base64.

2. **Decoding the string:**

```javascript
let decodedString = atob(encodedString);
```

The `atob()` function is used to decode a Base64 string into its original form.

Please note that Base64 encoding and decoding are not perfect for encoding and decoding strings. They are primarily used for encoding binary data into ASCII text. If you have a long string, it might be better to use a more robust encoding method like JSON encoding.

Here's an example of how you can use JSON encoding and decoding:

1. **Encoding the string:**

```javascript
let longString = ""Your long string here"";
let encodedString = JSON.stringify(longString);
```

The `JSON.stringify()` function is used to convert a JavaScript object or value into a JSON string.

2. **Decoding the string:**

```javascript
let decodedString = JSON.parse(encodedString);
```

The `JSON.parse()` function is used to convert a JSON string into a JavaScript object or value.

Remember, JSON encoding and decoding are not perfect for encoding and decoding binary data. They are primarily used for encoding and decoding JavaScript objects or values. If you have binary data, you should use Base64 encoding and decoding.

Also, keep in mind that the length of the encoded string will depend on the length of the original string. Base64 encoding and decoding will not significantly reduce the length of the string. If you need to reduce the length of the string, you might need to use a more advanced encoding method."

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node using Heuristic search, we can use the A* algorithm. A* is a best-first search algorithm that combines the advantages of both breadth-first search and greedy best-first search. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of reaching the goal node from a given state.

In this case, we can use the Manhattan distance as our heuristic function. The Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the current state and the goal state. It is a good heuristic function because it is admissible (it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal) and it is consistent (it always chooses the same action when there is a tie).

Here's the A* algorithm for finding the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node:

1. Initialize the open list with the starting state (PacMan's current position) and the closed list as an empty set.
2. While the open list is not empty:
a. Remove the state with the lowest f-value (g-value + h-value) from the open list.
b. If the state is the goal state, return the path from the starting state to the goal state.
c. For each of the state's neighbors, do the following:
i. If the neighbor is not in the closed list, add it to the open list.
ii. If the neighbor is already in the open list, update its g-value if the new path to the neighbor is shorter.
iii. If the neighbor is in the closed list, update its g-value if the new path to the neighbor is shorter.
3. If the goal state is not found, return the path with the lowest cost from the starting state to the closest state in the closed list.

Using the A* algorithm with the Manhattan distance as the heuristic function, the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node is:

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.

Character 2: Mr. Charles Blackwood
Mr. Charles Blackwood is a wealthy and influential businessman who has made his fortune in the pharmaceutical industry. He is a shrewd and ruthless individual who will stop at nothing to protect his interests and maintain his power.
Conflict:
The conflict between Dr. Hartley and Mr. Blackwood arises when Dr. Hartley discovers a cure for a rare and deadly genetic disease that has been plaguing the world for centuries. The cure is a revolutionary breakthrough that has the potential to save millions of lives, but it also has the potential to disrupt the pharmaceutical industry and threaten Mr. Blackwood's profits.
Mr. Blackwood, who has a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, sees Dr. Hartley's discovery as a threat to his business and his power. He will stop at nothing to suppress the discovery and discredit Dr. Hartley, even if it means resorting to illegal and unethical means.
Dr. Hartley, on the other hand, is determined to bring the cure to the world and save lives, no matter the cost. She is willing to risk everything, including her reputation and her career, to ensure that the cure is made available to those who need it.
The conflict between Dr. Hartley and Mr. Blackwood is a classic example of the struggle between the pursuit of knowledge and the pursuit of power. It is a battle of wills that will test the limits of their determination and their integrity.

One of the ways they achieve this is by evaluating production organizations that they work with. Here's a simplified explanation of how EASA evaluates each supplier:

1. **Application**: The supplier must first submit an application to EASA, providing detailed information about their organization, products, and processes.

2. **Assessment**: EASA then conducts an assessment of the supplier's capabilities, including a review of their quality management system, production processes, and technical expertise. This assessment is usually carried out by EASA inspectors who visit the supplier's premises.

3. **Compliance with Regulations**: EASA checks whether the supplier complies with all relevant aviation safety regulations. This includes checking that the supplier has the necessary certifications and that their products meet the required safety standards.

4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Once a supplier is approved, EASA continues to monitor their performance. This includes regular inspections and audits to ensure that the supplier continues to meet the required safety standards.

5. **Revocation of Approval**: If a supplier fails to meet the required safety standards, EASA can revoke their approval. This means that the supplier can no longer supply products to the aviation industry.

It's important to note that the evaluation process is rigorous and thorough. EASA's primary goal is to ensure the safety of European aviation, and they take this responsibility very seriously."

[Intro music]

Host: Welcome to the Future of Energy podcast, where we explore the latest developments in renewable energy and discuss the potential impact on our planet. Today, we're excited to bring you a special episode on the future of renewable energy.

[Guest introduction]

Host: Joining us today are two experts in the field of renewable energy. Dr. Jane Smith is a professor of renewable energy at the University of California, Berkeley, and has been studying the potential of renewable energy sources for over 20 years. Dr. John Doe is the CEO of a leading renewable energy company and has been at the forefront of developing new technologies to make renewable energy more accessible and affordable.

[Segment 1: Current state of renewable energy]

Host: Let's start by discussing the current state of renewable energy. Dr. Smith, can you give us an overview of the progress that has been made in recent years?

Dr. Smith: Absolutely. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, have made significant strides in recent years. The cost of solar panels has dropped by over 80% in the past decade, making it a more affordable option for households and businesses. Wind energy has also become more cost-effective, with the cost of wind turbines decreasing by over 70% in the past decade.

[Segment 2: Potential technological advancements]

Host: That's great to hear. Dr. Doe, what are some potential technological advancements that could impact renewable energy sources in the future?

Dr. Doe: One area that we're particularly excited about is the development of advanced battery technology. Batteries are essential for storing renewable energy and making it available when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. We're seeing significant advancements in battery technology, such as the development of solid-state batteries, which could offer higher energy density and longer lifespan.

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
