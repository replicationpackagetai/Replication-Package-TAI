In the heart of a war-torn city, a lone Maria stood, her heart heavy with the weight of the world's suffering. As a peace activist, she dedicated her life to spreading a message of love and understanding in a world that seemed to be consumed by violence and conflict.

Maria was a small woman, but her spirit was as fierce as a lion. She had seen the devastation that war had wrought on her people, and she was determined to make a difference. Every day, she would take to the streets, her voice ringing out loud and clear, calling for an end to the violence and a start to peace.

But it was not an easy path. The government officials saw her as a threat, They tried to silence her, to make her disappear. But Maria was not deterred. She knew that her message was too important to be silenced.


One of her closest friends, a man named John, stood by her side. He was a former soldier, haunted by the memories of the battles he had fought. But he too had seen the devastation that war had wrought, and he too was determined to make a difference. Together, they worked tirelessly, spreading their message of peace to anyone who would listen.

But their efforts were not without consequence. Many saw them as naive and foolish, unwilling to face the harsh realities of the world. Others saw them as a threat, and sought to undermine their work. But Maria and John pressed on, their hearts filled with hope and determination.

As they continued their work, they began to see a change. More and more people were listening, more and more were joining their cause. They saw the impact of their work on the lives of those around them, and it gave them hope. They saw the light of peace beginning to shine in the darkest corners of the city, and it filled their hearts with joy.

But the road was still long and the challenges were still great. They knew that their work was far from over, but they took solace in the knowledge that they were making a difference. They knew that the world was a complex place, with many competing interests and ideologies. But they held fast to their belief that peace was possible, and they continued to work towards it,"

Answer according to: Palisades, NY - Frank Cheney Platt, advocate for poetry, poets, literature and writers, dedicated husband and father, died on February 26, in Rockleigh, NJ. Following its founding in 1985, he helped to build Poets House, now headquartered in Battery Park City, into a national poetry library and literary center with a 70,000-volume collection. Frank loved poetry that ""communicate[s] before it is understood"" (T.S. Eliot) and captures what is ""lost in translation."" (Robert Frost). In addition, he was committed to arts and culture as a means of protecting and cultivating principles of free speech and an open society.
He was born in New York City on November 6, 1932 and raised by his father Roger Platt, a teacher at St. Bernard's School, his mother Frances Cheney, and his grandfather Frank Cheney Jr. of Manchester, CT. Frank was educated at St. Bernard's, Dalton, Eaglebrook, Governor's Academy (formerly Governor Dummer), and Harvard College. He worked in publishing before becoming president of the Farfield Foundation, and later an assistant Dean for Columbia's School of the Arts.
In 2013, Frank was predeceased by his wife of 55 years Judy van der Gracht. She was the love of his life. His poignant dedication to her (including during her time with Alzheimer's) inspired respect and admiration from all who knew them. Frank was also passionate about his extended family - the Platts, Cheneys and, on Judy's side of the family, the Gilberts and van der Grachts as well as his dozen godchildren. His many longstanding and deeply-felt friendships were legion. Most involved a common love of music, poetry, literature and epicurean delights, not necessarily in that order.

Chapter 1

The sun dipped low over the quaint little town of Willowville, casting a warm, golden glow over the cobblestone streets and red-brick rooftops The air was thick with the scent of freshly baked bread and the distant hum of a church bell tolling the hour. The townsfolk were bustling about their daily business, their laughter and chatter echoing off the stone walls of the old church.

In the heart of the town, a young woman named Amelia stood in the doorway of her family's bakery, her eyes fixed on the figure of a tall, dark-haired stranger who stood across the street. He was playing a guitar, his fingers dancing over the strings with a passion and skill that made Amelia's heart flutter with longing.


Chapter 2

Amelia watched as the stranger finished his song, his eyes meeting hers for a moment before he packed up his guitar and disappeared into the crowd. She felt a pang of disappointment, but she knew she could not follow him. She had responsibilities to her family and the bakery, and her dreams of music were just that - dreams.

But as the days passed, Amelia found herself unable to shake the memory of the stranger's music from her mind. She spent hours in her room, her fingers dancing over the strings of her own guitar, trying to recreate the melody she had heard that day.

Chapter 3

One evening, as Amelia was practicing, she heard a knock at the door. She opened it to find the stranger standing there, a smile playing at the corners of his mouth.

""I've been looking for you,"" he said, his eyes searching hers. ""I thought I'd lost you.""

Amelia's heart raced with excitement, but she tried to hide it behind a coy smile. ""I'm here,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

The stranger stepped inside, his eyes never leaving Amelia's face. He sat down on the couch, his guitar in his lap. ""I've been playing in the park,"" he said, ""I thought you might come.""

Amelia's heart raced again, but this"

Generate according to: A counterweight at the end of the space elevator will keep the carbon-nanotubes ribbon taut.
To better understand the concept of a space elevator, think of the game tetherball in which a rope is attached at one end to a pole and at the other to a ball. In this analogy, the rope is the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon, the pole is the Earth and the ball is the counterweight. Now, imagine the ball is placed in perpetual spin around the pole, so fast that it keeps the rope taut. This is the general idea of the space elevator. The counterweight spins around the Earth, keeping the cable straight and allowing the robotic lifters to ride up and down the ribbon.
Under the design proposed by LiftPort, the space elevator would be approximately 62,000 miles (100,000 km) high. LiftPort is one of several companies developing plans for a space elevator or components of it. Teams from across the world are set to compete for the $400,000 first prize in the Space Elevator Games at the X Prize Cup in October 2006 in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
The centerpiece of the elevator will be the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon that is just a few centimeters wide and nearly as thin as a piece of paper. Carbon nanotubes, discovered in 1991, are what make scientists believe that the space elevator could be built. According to Dr. Bradley Edwards of the Spaceward Foundation, ""Previously the material challenges were too great. But now we're getting close with the advances in creating carbon nanotubes and in building machines that can spin out the great lengths of material needed to create a ribbon that will stretch up into space"" [ref].
Under some early plans, leftover construction materials will be used to form the counterweight.
Carbon nanotubes have the potential to be 100 times stronger than steel and are as flexible as plastic. The strength of carbon nanotubes comes from their unique structure, which resembles soccer balls. Once scientists are able to make fibers from carbon nanotubes, it will be possible to create threads that will form the ribbon for the space elevator. Previously available materials were either too weak or inflexible to form the ribbon and would have been easily broken.
""They have very high elastic modulus and their tensile strength is really high, and that all points to a material that, in theory, should make a space elevator relatively easy to build,"" said Tom Nugent, research director, LiftPort Group.
Long carbon nanotubes -- several meters long or longer -- would be braided into a structure resembling a rope. As of 2005, the longest nanotubes are still only a few centimeters long.
Shorter nanotubes could be placed in a polymer matrix. Current polymers do not bind well to carbon nanotubes, which results in the matrix being pulled away from the nanotubes when placed under tension.
Once a long ribbon of nanotubes is created, it would be wound into a spool that would be launched into orbit. When the spacecraft carrying the spool reaches a certain altitude, perhaps Low Earth Orbit, it would begin unspooling, lowering the ribbon back to Earth. At the same time, the spool would continue moving to a higher altitude. When the ribbon is lowered into Earth's atmosphere, it would be caught and then lowered and anchored to a mobile platform in the ocean.
The ribbon would serve as the tracks of a sort of railroad into space. Mechanical lifters would then be used to climb the ribbon to space.
If built, the ribbon will represent a modern world wonder, and will be the tallest structure ever built. Consider that the world's tallest freestanding tower in 2005 is the CN Tower, which rises 1,815 feet 5 inches (553.34 meters) over Toronto, Canada. The space elevator would be 180,720 times taller than the CN Tower!
The 62,000-mile (100,000-km) long space elevator would rise far above the average orbiting height of the space shuttle (115-400 miles/185-643 km). In fact, it would equal nearly a fourth of the distance to the moon, which orbits the Earth at 237,674 miles (382,500 km).","The space elevator would be a remarkable engineering feat, reaching an incredible height of approximately 62,000 miles (100,000 km). The ribbon, made of carbon nanotubes, would be spun by a counterweight at the end to keep it taut and allow mechanical lifters to climb up and down the ribbon. The ribbon would be launched into orbit, unspooled, and anchored to a mobile platform in the ocean. This ribbon would serve as the tracks for the lifters, which would climb the ribbon to reach space. The space elevator would be a modern marvel, standing taller than the world's tallest freestanding tower, the CN Tower, by 180,720 times. It would also reach nearly a fourth of the distance to the moon."

In the heart of the bustling city of VeridOdyssey, a young woman named Elara stood at the precipice of a life-altering decision. Elara was a renowned musician, her voice a beacon of hope for the oppressed citizens of her country, Veridia. Her music had been the anthem of their resistance against the tyrannical rule of the cruel Emperor, a man known only as the Iron Fist.

Elara had always been a patriot, her heart burning with a passion for freedom and justice. But as the years passed, her fame grew, and with it came the attention of the Iron Fist himself. He offered her a deal: she could continue her music, but she must perform only for him, and never again sing the songs of rebellion.

Elara was torn. On one hand, she could continue her music, bring joy to her people, and live a life of luxury and comfort. On the other, she could stand up to the Iron Fist, risk her life, and possibly spark a revolution.

As she stood at the precipice of the stage, the crowd below her cheered for her. She could hear the whispers of the Iron Fist's guards, their eyes cold and calculating. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and began to sing.

But as she sang, she felt a change come over her. The words of her song took on a new meaning, a call to arms, a clarion call to rise up against the Iron Fist. The crowd below her began to chant, their voices rising in unison with hers.

Elara felt a surge of pride and determination. She knew what she had to do. She would stand up to the Iron Fist, and she would lead her people to freedom.

As she finished her song, the crowd erupted into cheers. The Iron Fist's guards moved forward, their faces twisted with anger. But Elara stood her ground, her eyes locked on the Iron Fist.


The Iron Fist sneered at her, his eyes cold and cruel. But Elara stood her ground, her voice strong and defiant. She would not back down, she would not be silenced.

In the summer of 2003 In the heart of Spain, I found myself immersed in a culture that was as different as a desert. The language barrier was the first challenge I faced, stepping off the plane in Madrid. I had spent months learning Spanish, but nothing could have prepared me for the rapid-fire, passionate speech of the locals. I remember my first day in school, trying to understand my teacher's instructions, only to be met with a sympathetic smile and a few words of encouragement.

The culture shock was intense, but it was also exhilarating. I was captivated by the vibrant energy of the city, the rich history that surrounded me, and the warmth of the people. I quickly learned to embrace the culture, adopting the local customs and traditions with open arms.

One of my most memorable experiences was a trip to the small town of Ronda, nestled in the mountains of Andalusia. I remember the narrow, winding streets, the breathtaking views of the gorge, and the delicious tapas and sangria that filled my senses. It was in Ronda that I truly felt like I had found a home away from home.

Another significant event that impacted my time in Spain was the national strike. The entire country came to a standstill, with roads blocked and shops closed. I remember the sense of solidarity and unity that filled the air, as people took to the streets to protest the government's policies. It was a powerful moment, and one that I will never forget.

Looking back on my year in Spain, I am filled with gratitude for the experiences I had and the people I met. I learned so much about myself, about the world, and about the power of human connection. I am forever changed, and I will carry the memories of my time in Spain with me always."

Although there have been very powerful campaigns to spread awareness about water conservation, very few gave practical and doable solutions. #CuttingPaani 1.0 was a huge success in the digital and social media space because it was a doable idea and everybody could follow it. This success of #CuttingPaani 1.0 prompted us to launch the #CuttingPaani 2.0.
What were the consumer insights that Livpure accrued before getting both these campaigns out?
Our dipstick showed that Indians, in general, are very casual about wasting water. And, as we all know, it is a very scarce resource and possibly future wars would be fought for water. We waste water in a lot of ways- whether it is drinking water or water used during bathing or during brushing or shaving. We picked up #CuttingPaani since it was a catchy phrase, with it being a take on #CuttingChai. Knowing fully well that this would strike the necessary chord in making people realise that though the message is about saving drinking water it will sensitise them to the fact that we indeed waste a lot of water in other areas as well.
Why a digital film to tell the story of Shimla’s #AdoptCuttingPaani story?
In today’s time, the digital reach is high, sharp and targeting is better apart from the fact that we have the liberty of time to communicate the story, unlike an ATL medium. We are confident about the virality quotient of the campaign. In fact, a lot of newspapers in India have leveraged on our #CuttingPaani 1.0 campaign by asking readers to consume only as much as you need. Though, in a lighter vein, I must add that none of them have given us credit.
Can this campaign be converted into a mass movement?
We wish to own #CuttingPaani and take this idea further for sure and #CuttingPaani 2.0 is a step in that direction. We wish to take this further through BTL activations; social media campaigns and collaboration with large hotels/restaurants. To maintain awareness and memorability of the above, we have launched #CuttingPaaniTake on our Facebook page, which essentially gives two perspectives on topical situations.
The first example – on changing names of cities: one take is -The names of the cities are changing and the other take is -sadly, that’s the only thing changing about them!
The second example – on Mary Kom winning boxing championship: one take is -some think having children ends a woman’s career and the other take is - well, she just won her 6th boxing championship!","The new campaign by Livpure, titled #CuttingPaani, is a clever play on the popular concept of #CuttingChai. The campaign aims to address the issue of water conservation by encouraging people to only consume as much water as they need, rather than wasting it. The campaign has gained popularity on social media and has the potential to become a mass movement with further activations, such as social media campaigns and collaborations with hotels and restaurants. The campaign's success is based on its relatable and doable nature, as well as its catchy phrase. The campaign also aims to raise awareness about the larger issue of water conservation by sensitising people to the fact that they waste water in various ways, not just when drinking. The campaign has already been successful in gaining attention and traction on social media, and Livpure plans to take it further by launching a digital film to tell the story of Shimla's #AdoptCuttingPaani story, which is a real-life example of the campaign's message. The campaign's Facebook page, #CuttingPaaniTake, also provides two perspectives on topical situations to maintain awareness and memorability."

“We are grateful for the FCC’s work on behalf of consumers to actively broker a productive path forward,” said Jeff Blum, DISH senior VP and deputy general counsel. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
Sinclair pulled its signals on Tuesday after a short extension expired and the two parties could not reach an agreement. Dish had claimed it had come to an agreement on pricing for Sinclair’s stations, but that the broadcaster was demanding the satellite giant negotiate carriage for an unnamed cable channel Sinclair hoped to own. Dish also had filed a complaint with the FCC, claiming Sinclair was not negotiating in good faith. As part of its new deal, Dish is asking the FCC to stay action on the complaint as its long-term agreement is being finalized.
The chairman also trumpeted the tentative agreement and the FCC&apos;s role in pressing for resolution. ""Today the most extensive retransmission blackout in history ended,"" he Tweeted, followed by: ""The FCC will remain vigilant. Use of the public airwaves is a public trust.""
""We are pleased to see that five million Dish subscribers are again able to access their local news and programming and most-watched network entertainment and live sporting events with the agreement reached this evening by Sinclair and Dish,"" said Rob Kenny of TVFreedom.org, a broadcaster-backed advocate for the retrans system.

The sun dipped low, casting a warm, golden glow over the quaint little town of Willoway, nestled in the heart of the English countryside. The cobblestones, lined with ivy, seemed to whisper secrets of the past as they swayed gently in the breeze. The air was thick with the scent of blooming flowers and the distant sound of laughter from children playing in the park.

In the heart of the town, a quaint little tea shop, The Willoway Tea Room, stood proudly. Its ivy-covered walls and red-tiled roof were a beacon of comfort and warmth to the weary traveler. Inside, the air was thick with the aroma of freshly-brewed tea and the sweet scent of freshly-baked pastries.

At a small table near the window, sat two old friends, Emily and Sarah, who had grown apart years ago. Their laughter echoed through the room, mingling with the soft strum of a violin playing in the background.

Emily, Emily's eyes sparkled with tears as she looked at her old friend. ""I can't believe it's been so long, Sarah,"" she said, her voice thick with emotion. ""I've missed you so much.""

Sarah's eyes shone with empathy as she reached across the table to take Emily's hand. ""I've missed you too, Emily,"" she said, her voice trembling with emotion. ""I never thought I'd see you again.""

The two friends spent the afternoon reminiscing about their childhood memories, sharing stories of their present lives, and catching up on all the years they'd missed. They laughed and cried, their hearts opening up to each other once more.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm, pink glow over the town, Emily and Sarah stood up, their hearts heavy with the weight of their emotions. They hugged each other tightly, promising to stay in touch and to meet again soon.

As they walked out of the tea shop, hand in hand, they knew that their friendship had been reborn. They walked off into the twilight, their hearts filled with hope for the future and the knowledge that they'd never be apart again."

Politics played a crucial role in shaping the alliances and decisions made by the Allied Nations, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom. The political leaders of these nations made decisions about when and when to enter the war, how to conduct the war, and how to allocate resources. These decisions were heavily influenced by political considerations such as the political climate of the time, the interests of their respective nations, and the political alliances they had with other nations.

For example, the United States entered the war after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which was a political decision made by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The decision to drop the atomic bombs on Hiroshima was also a political decision, made by President Harry S. Truman, in response to the political pressure to end the war quickly and save American lives.

In addition, the politics of the time also played a role in the decisions made by the Allied Nations about how to conduct the war. For example, the decision to invade Normandy was made by the Allied leaders in response to political pressure to open up a second front in Europe and take the war to the enemy.

Overall, the role of politics in the Second World War was significant, The political decisions made by the leaders of the Allied Nations played a crucial role in shaping the course of the war and ultimately determining its outcome."

Include a variety of examples and anecdotes to support your points, and make sure to emphasize the importance of mindful, sustainable eating practices.","Title: The Advantages of In-Season Eating: In-Season Produce and Crafting Meals Introduction:

In-season eating and crafting meals is a conscious approach to food consumption that emphasizes the importance of eating fresh, locally-grown produce and consuming seasonal fruits and vegetables, and using traditional cooking techniques to create delicious, nutritious, and sustainable meals. This approach not only supports local farmers and the environment, but also promotes health and well-being, and enhances the flavor of the food.

Advantages of In-Season Eating

1. Supports Local Farmers: By eating in-season produce, you are directly supporting local farmers and the local economy. This is because in-season produce is typically grown locally, which means that the money you spend on food stays within the community.

2. Supports the Environment: Eating in-season produce reduces the carbon footprint of the food you consume, as it does not require transportation over long distances. This helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promotes sustainability.

3. Enhances Flavor: In-season produce is often more flavorful, as it is picked at the peak of its ripeness, and does not have to be picked prematurely to allow for transportation. This means that the food you consume will taste better, and you will enjoy your meals more.



4. Promotes Health: Eating in-season produce is often more nutritious, as it is picked at the peak of its ripeness, and does not have to be picked prematurely to allow for transportation. This means that the food you consume will be more nutritious, and promotes your health.


5. Reduces Food Waste: Eating in-season produce reduces food waste, as it is consumed at the peak of its ripeness, and does not have to be stored for long periods of time. This means that less food is wasted, and you save money.

Crafting Meals


1. Supports Traditional Cooking Techniques: Crafting meals using traditional cooking techniques can help to preserve the flavor and nutritiousness of the food, and can also help to reduce waste. For example, canning and pickling are traditional techniques that can help to preserve fruits and vegetables for"

It’s already been a year since Pope John Paul’s death. It seems only yesterday that we were out standing in Saint Peter’s Square, looking up at the familiar face in the window as he struggled to communicate with the expectant crowds below. Still fresh in our minds is the inundation of affection as the throngs poured into Rome to accompany this giant of the faith in his final hours, and to bid farewell to a dear friend.
#ad#John Paul is sorely missed. The crowds of pilgrims that have once more filled the streets of Rome to celebrate this anniversary testify to the impact he had on countless lives. More than a world leader, John Paul somehow managed to be a father and a friend to all. Even as a player on the world scene, he never lost his personal touch.
Many are now trying to reevaluate the legacy of this great pope, and as necessary as this endeavor is, a more personal reflection seems more in keeping with John Paul’s own style. I am sure that some of the things I most miss will resonate with many.
I miss, perhaps most of all, John Paul’s warmth and humanity. His quick wit and impish humor–like the vaudeville-style cane-twirling in Manila or his improvised raccoon-eyes to the delight of children–shattered notions of a dour Polish Christianity. His ability to focus on the person in front of him as if he or she were the only person in the world spoke volumes about the heart that beat in his breast. In an age when religion can be used as an excuse for violence and conflict, John Paul showed us that true faith in God is not only compatible with love for humanity, it galvanizes it. John Paul sincerely loved people–all people–and it was his Christian faith that enabled him to do so.
I miss his presence on the world scene. I remember him scolding mafia leaders in Sicily (which led to bombings of churches), fearlessly standing up to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, and defending human rights in his native Poland. He could be counted on to stand up for those most in need, to challenge world leaders to integrity, to preach Christ with an unaffected self-confidence that flowed from a deep-seated faith in God and a trust in the fundamental goodness of the human person. John Paul reached out perhaps more than any pope before him to a world in need, and provided moral authority and leadership when our generation needed it most.
I miss John Paul’s unflagging hope. His bright vision of the future and his characterization of the third millennium as a springtime of faith encouraged us to look beyond our real difficulties and to reach out for solutions. Far from a mere temperamental optimism, John Paul’s outlook was rooted in the firm belief that the battle is already won. Even from the midst of evil–John Paul wrote in his last book–God can and will continue to bring good. From his first “Be not afraid!” spoken on the day of his election in 1978 to his final witness of serene and hopeful suffering, John Paul taught us to abandon fear and to live with confidence in an infinitely good and merciful God.
I miss John Paul’s prayerfulness. Even in the midst of a grueling agenda of meetings, travels, and writings, the pontiff always made abundant time for prayer. Four hours a day was not unusual. What a challenge to those of us for whom prayer can seem at best like a luxury, or at worst like an underutilization of our precious time. Like Jesus before him, John Paul made prayer a priority and placed his trust more in God than in the best-laid programs of men and governments.
Incessant calls for John Paul’s sainthood, and the news of a probable miracle attributed to his intercession (poignantly, the cure of a French nun suffering from Parkinson’s disease) give grounds for hope that soon the Church will officially recognize what many already believe–that the man who so faithfully looked after humanity while on earth continues to do so from heaven.

Introduction

X Company, a leading provider of innovative software solutions for small and medium-sized businesses, faced a challenge in 2018 when it realized that its customer engagement was low, leading to decreased customer satisfaction and revenue growth. To address this issue, the company developed and implemented a comprehensive customer engagement strategy that focused on improving customer relationships, increasing customer satisfaction, and driving revenue growth. This case study will detail the development and implementation of X Company's customer engagement strategy, and the positive impact it has had on the company's bottom line.

Development of the Customer Engagement Strategy

The customer engagement strategy was developed by a cross-functional team of employees from various departments within the company, including sales, marketing, customer service, and product development. The team conducted extensive research on customer pain points, needs, and preferences, and used this information to develop a strategy that focused on improving the customer experience at every touchpoint, from initial contact to post-sale support.

The strategy included several key components:

1. Personalized customer service: The company implemented a personalized customer service approach, where each customer was assigned a dedicated account manager who would be their main point of contact for all of their needs. This allowed for a more personalized and attentive approach, and helped to build stronger relationships with customers.
2. Improved customer communication: The company improved its communication with customers by implementing regular check-ins and updates, and by making it easier for customers to reach out to the company with questions or concerns. This helped to increase transparency and trust with customers, and led to a more positive customer experience.
3. Enhanced product development: The company also focused on enhancing its product development process to better meet the needs of its customers. This included conducting regular customer surveys and focus groups, and using the feedback to make improvements to its products and services.

Implementation of the Customer Engagement Strategy

The customer engagement strategy was implemented in stages, with a focus on improving one aspect of the customer experience at a time. The first stage focused on personalized customer service, with the company assigning dedicated account managers to each customer. This was followed by a focus on improving communication, and then on enhancing product development.

In the heart of bustling city of New York, a young woman named Samantha lives a seemingly ordinary life. She works as a data analyst, lives in a small apartment, and has a close-knit friendship with her neighbor, Jack. But Samantha has a secret: she has the unique ability to communicate with machines.

One day, Samantha's life takes a dramatic turn when she discovers a hidden feature in her car's dashboard that allows her to communicate with it. She is amazed by her newfound power, and spends hours talking to her car, making it play her favorite songs, adjust the temperature, and even navigate the city streets with ease.

As Samantha's relationship with her car deepens, she begins to feel a sense of connection to the machine that goes beyond simple communication. She starts to talk to her phone, TV, and even the elevator in her apartment building. She feels a sense of power and control that she has never experienced before.

But as Samantha's relationship with machines grows, so does the tension in her relationships with the people in her life. Jack becomes jealous of the time she spends with Samantha's newfound power, and her boss begins to question her mental health.

She vows to make amends and reconnect with Jack and the others who have been left behind.

One of the long-standing concerns of Virginia’s legal community has been the handling of judicial appointments by the General Assembly.
Unlike many states that have elected judges, Virginia leaves all judicial appointments in the hands of state legislators. In theory, this arrangement removes judges from the influence of politics. In practice, judicial appointments have become tools of patronage.
In recent years, the Virginia Bar Association and other groups have complained about judicial vacancies and mounting case backlogs in many courts throughout the commonwealth.
In 2015, however, the appointment of a Virginia Supreme Court judge became a power struggle between Gov. Terry McAuliffe and the General Assembly’s Republican leadership.
The political maneuvering that has taken place to oust McAuliffe’s appointee has provoked calls for reform of the system.
Last summer McAuliffe named former Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Jane Marum Roush to the Supreme Court while the legislature was not in session.
Republicans cried foul, claiming they were not consulted on the interim appointment. They vowed to remove Roush from the court and name their own appointee.
Attempts to oust the justice from her seat, however, were thwarted when one moderate Republican state senator, John Watkins, and then his successor, Glen H. Sturtevant Jr., failed to follow along. Their dissent denied the Republicans the majority they needed in the Virginia Senate.
In early February, the tug-of-war over the justice took a surprising turn when state Sen. Louise Lucas, a Democrat from Portsmouth, briefly agreed to join the Republicans in replacing Roush. According to news accounts, Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr., a Republican from James City County, had proposed putting Portsmouth Circuit Court Judge Kenneth R. Melvin, a former legislator and Lucas’ mentor, on the state Court of Appeals.
Lucas, however, quickly changed her stance after meeting with McAuliffe and state Sen. Donald McEachin, head of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
Twenty-seven former presidents of the Virginia Bar Association released a statement urging McAuliffe and the Republican legislative leadership to resolve their quarrel.
“One of the greatest concerns is that the unseemly exchange that has occurred will make otherwise qualified lawyers not consider a life of public service as a judge,” said Lucia Anna “Pia” Trigiani of MercerTrigiani in Alexandria, the VBA’s president in 2011.
Roush’s temporary appointment expired in mid-February, but McAuliffe is expected to appoint her to another interim term after the legislative session ends. Based on the passage above, What concerns have been raised by the Virginia Bar Association about the impact of the political maneuvering over judicial appointments on the legal community?","The concerns raised by the Virginia Bar Association about the impact of the political maneuvering over judicial appointments on the legal community include the potential for judges to be used as tools of politics, the mounting case backlogs in many courts throughout the commonwealth, and the possibility that otherwise qualified lawyers may not consider a life of public service as a judge due to the unseemly exchange that has occurred."
cbaf21d8a20bd4bea915b5c3139e6693ab2b8aa8764b8b885ec71557326285c4,"Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How have labour shortages affected various sectors in the Visegrad countries and what risks does this pose to their economies?

Passage: People's migration fears have been an easy one to exploit for electoral opportunism by many politicians in Europe.
Particularly in the Visegrad states of Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, it has either brought nationalist anti-immigration parties into power or helped consolidate their grip on it.
Yet, much more attention ought to be given in those countries to how much migrants are needed for their booming economies' labour markets.
This has been a result of consequent high economic GDP growth of 3-4 percent in the past five years, compared to the EU's average of two percent growth.
In 2017, these were 4.8 percent (Poland, PL); 4.3 percent (Czechia, CZ); 4.1 percent (Hungary, HU) and 3.2 percent (Slovakia, SK) respectively.
In parallel, unemployment dropped heavily to 4.9 percent (PL); 2.9 percent (CZ); 4.2 percent (HU) and 8.1 percent (SK) by 2017.
Latest European Commission forecasts show these will continue decreasing sharply to 2.9 percent (PL); 2.5 percent (CZ); 3.3 percent (HU) and 6.3 percent next year, well below the five percent normal unemployment rate.
As good as that might sound, a side-effect has been that many vacancies remained unfulfilled.
The amount of open vacancies has more than quadrupled in the past five years. Especially in Czechia and Poland this is causing serious problems, despite the latter's profiting from Ukrainian migrants.
The commission's Spring and Autumn forecasts highlight these risks, which could undermine long-term growth, or even overheat the economy in the case of Czechia.
For Poland, despite the Ukrainian influx, there are doubts whether they can continue filling some of these shortages.
Business surveys confirm labour shortages limit production, building activity and business.
In industry, 43.7 percent (CZ); 83.3 percent (HU); 49.9 percent (PL); and 34.9 percent (SK) of surveyed companies state this is a problem.
For the construction sector, 37.8 percent (CZ); 64.4 percent (HU); 49.0 percent (PL) and 30.3 percent (SK) do.
Moreover, in services 17.3 percent (CZ); 38.3 percent (HU); 28.9 percent (PL) and 18.6 percent (SK) attest.
The labour shortages have also led to wages rising much faster than the rise in productivity.
In Slovakia and Hungary, Volkswagen and Kia for instance were forced to significantly increase wages because of strikes. Generally, labour costs are spiking in the Visegrad states.
While benefitting workers in the short-term, the economy could suffer in the long-term, as they undermine their low-wage economic models. It also jeopardises essential foreign investment that has helped drive growth.
In addition, the V4 is set to suffer as well from its demographic situation. Emigration and low fertility rates remain serious problems, dating back to their economic shock-therapy transitions where many struggled and had no jobs.
Due to this, populations remained stagnant since 1990.
The 2004 EU accession, particularly, caused many to emigrate abroad in search of (better paid) work abroad: circa three million people (registered) left the V4 between 2004 and 2016.
While profiting from remittances, this caused brain drain and the outflow of high-skilled labour. In turn, it also undermined welfare spending and made government budgets less growth friendly.
Demographics could constrain economic growth and governmental budgets again in the future.
Baseline projections for 2020 up to 2060 show the Visegrad Four's population could decrease by another 6.5 million people. In addition, the dependency ratio is set to increase sharply as well.
The dire demographic situation and labour shortages imply action is needed. Tight labour markets have already limited economic expansion in different sectors.
While in Poland Ukrainian labour prevented worse labour shortages, it is unclear how many more will come or stay. This means for Poland, as well as for the others that additional migrants from elsewhere will be needed.
More could be done as well to promote people having children and attract former emigrants. It should also make sure to keep current migrants, especially Ukrainians in the case of Poland.
Current hostile rhetoric on migration could backfire economically as many more migrants are needed to fill labour shortages and keep economies running smoothly.
This also requires honest debates in which the pros and cons of migration are discussed, as well as the Visegrad's overall demographic problems, since dependency ratios will continue to increase.
Therefore, rather than focusing on the imagined threat of migration and exploiting fears for electoral opportunism, the Visegrad's politicians would be wise to focus on the actual threat of how the lack of migrants could undermine their economic models, and with it their future prosperity and welfare.
Moreover, while migration has been a successful strategy to win elections in the short term, it could backfire in the long term.
The V4 countries have become one of the most vocal and recognised groups within the EU. But 2017 has seen a shake-up in the informal eastern and central European power bloc.","The passage discusses the impact of migration on various sectors in Visegrad countries, particularly Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, and Slovenia. It highlights that migration has helped these countries's economies grow, with high GDP growth rates and decreasing unemployment rates. However, it also mentions that this has led to labour shortages, which have caused problems in filling vacancies and have led to rising wages. The passage also mentions that the labour shortages have led to increased labour costs, which could undermine the low-wage economic models of these countries in the long term. It also mentions that the Visegrad Four's demographic situation is a serious problem, with low fertility rates and emigration causing stagnant populations and increasing dependency ratios. The passage suggests that more could be done to promote population growth and attract former emigrants, and that honest debates are needed on the pros and cons of migration.

The product I propose to develop is a line of reusable, eco-friendly water bottles that are designed to last for a lifetime, reducing plastic waste and promoting sustainability. The bottles will be made from 100% recycled aluminum, a highly durable and eco-friendly material that is easily recycled and can be used indefinitely.

The target market for these bottles is environmentally conscious consumers who are looking for a sustainable alternative to traditional plastic water bottles. With the growing awareness of the negative impact of plastic waste on the environment, there is a significant demand for eco-friendly products, and water bottles are no exception.

The unique selling point of our eco-friendly water bottles is their durability. Unlike traditional plastic bottles, which are disposable and often end up in landfills and oceans, our bottles are designed to last a lifetime. This not only reduces plastic waste, but also saves consumers money in the long run, as they will not have to continually purchase new bottles.

The pricing for our eco-friendly water bottles will be competitive with traditional plastic bottles, making them an affordable and attractive option for consumers. We will offer a variety of sizes and designs to appeal to a wide range of consumers, from athletes to office workers.

I believe there is a significant unmet need for eco-friendly water bottles in the marketplace.

Luna was a tiny ball of fur, with bright green eyes that seemed to see straight into my soul. She was timid and scared, but she clung to me tightly, as if she knew that I needed her as much as she needed me. In the weeks that followed, Luna became my constant companion, following me everywhere I went and providing me with a sense of comfort and love that I had been missing since my father's passing.

As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, Luna grew stronger and more confident. She became my confidant, my protector, and my best friend. She was always there to listen when I needed to talk, and to offer a comforting purr when I was feeling down. She was a constant reminder of the love and support that my father had given me, and of the strength that I had within myself.

One of my most vivid memories of Luna is of a time when I was feeling particularly low, curled up in bed, unable to face the world. Luna sensed my distress and came to me, nudging her way under the covers and curling up next to me. She purred and me, her warm body pressing against mine, and I felt a sense of peace wash over me. In that moment, I knew that I was not alone, and that Luna was there to help me through whatever I was facing.

Luna was with me for 14 years, until she passed away peacefully in my arms. She was my constant companion, my confidant, and my best friend. She helped me through some of the darkest times of my life, and taught me the true meaning of love and companionship. I will always be grateful for the time I had with her, and for the love and support she gave me. She will forever be a cherished memory, and a reminder"

97a51e8214f626cebc40f66d63d14d26a0b380770df0bd389571ff3680e017e9,"Can you remember spotting an Audi in the following films?
Audi cars have been featured in many movies over the years. Did you spot one in these films?
Thought by many to be the most successful movie franchises ever to be created, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has different movies for everyone. There have been 21 films released already — the most recent being Captain Marvel — and at least a dozen more in the pipeline.
You don’t only enjoy the action in these films, but you may also be able to spot a stylish Audi, too.
When it comes to the Iron Man trilogy, at least one Audi has been featured in every film! A 2007 R8 and S5 B8 can be found in the first movie, a 2009 A8 LD3 and 2010 R8 Spyder are spotted in the sequel, and a 2012 S7 and R8 e-tron are both featured in Iron Man 3. The R8 e-tron also turned up at a VIP screening of Iron Man 3 at London’s Leicester Square a few days before the movie’s general release.
Another Audi fact is that there were almost as many Audi cars in the three Iron Man movies as there was in one Captain America film (Civil War). Within its two hours and 27 minutes runtime, you can see the 2017 Audi R8 V10 Plus, the 2017 SQ7, the 2017 A4, the 2016 A7 Sportback and even the Audi prologue concept car — a vehicle hailed as a “signature car” for Audi by Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Board Member for Development at Audi.
There’s more than meets the eye, though. Be on the lookout for an Audi R8, A6 Hybrid and A3 as you watch the excitement unfold in Avengers: Age of Ultron, as well as an Audi TTS Roadster, R8 Spyder, Q7 and A8 during Spider-Man Homecoming — the first standalone film by our favorite web-slinger since he became involved in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Taking a step back from the Marvel Universe, the German brand is also spotted in other film adaptations of comic book heroes. An R8 Spyder feature in Wolverine — the titular protagonist’s actor Hugh Jackman even turned up at the London Leicester Square premiere of the film in the same car — and an A8 plays a role in the 2015 big screen edition of Fantastic Four.
You also might’ve noticed the German manufacturer’s presence in all three film adaptations of E.L. James’ novels, which follow the relationship of business magnate Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.
What made this brand of car most attractive to the directors of this film? The brand’s multiple appearances came as a result of a partnership that was set up between Audi and Universal Pictures — a deal that Audi no doubt has relished seeing as the movie series has grossed over $1 billion across the globe!
In the first film of the trilogy, movie fans will be able to spot an Audi S8 D4, a 2017 S7 and an R8 Spyder. In the sequel, Fifty Shades Darker, a set of Audi Q7 cars and an A3 took center stage, with both the R8 and Q7 returning when the franchise wrapped up last year with Fifty Shades Freed.
To talk about Audi’s feature in Mission Impossible, let’s rewind back to the year 2000 and Mission: Impossible 2 to showcase how Audi has been featured in the hit movie series that has always starred Tom Cruise in the lead role of Ethan Hunt.
In a thrilling part of the film, Hunt leads a mission to destroy a deadly biological weapon and finds himself in an exhilarating car chase with international thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall. Hunt is behind the wheel of a Porsche Boxster and Nordoff-Hall tries to hold him off while driving an Audi TT — suffice to say that the pursuit between the two German-made cars into oncoming traffic is filled with nail-biting and edge-of-your-seat drama!
We couldn’t create an article about movies and cars without mentioning the Fast and Furious franchise. After all, this is a series that features street racing, heists, and espionage using all manners of vehicles, and has so far spanned eight main series entries and two additional short films — grossing in excess of $5 billion to date.
Fans are continually impressed with films that come out as part of this movie set. In fact, a spin-off movie called Hobbs & Shaw is due for release this summer.
Bringing a focus to Furious 7 now — a movie that clutched at the heartstrings as it was the final one to feature an appearance by series regular Paul Walker due to the actor being killed while the movie was still being filmed — is where you can see Audi appearing in the franchise.
You can spot the Audi R8 when it competes in an exciting quarter-mile race against a classic Plymouth Barracuda in the early moments of the film.
In the previously discussed films, the Audi’s that were featured are all models that exist. With I, ROBOT though, we’re taken to the future to see what Audi cars may potentially look like in years to come. Called the Audi RSQ, this concept vehicle represented the first time Audi had ever develop a car that was to be specifically used in a major Hollywood motion picture.
This futuristic model boasted piloted driving which allowed Will Smith’s Chicago police detective character Del Spooner to press a button to enable the car to take control of the driving — no doubt an early vision of the autonomous driving concept that we are only just starting to see being trialed in real life.
Those who take a ride in the RSQ are able to ride sideways and diagonal, while the use of balls instead of wheels was a quirky design touch. However, the typical single-frame grille and the presence of those four instantly recognizable silver rings let viewers clearly know that this car was without question an Audi.
This article was created by Audi & VW service provider, Vindis. What special features did the futuristic Audi RSQ have in the movie I, ROBOT?","The Audi RSQ in the movie I, Robot had several special features that set it apart from other cars. One of the most notable features was its ability to drive sideways and diagonally, which was made possible by its unique design that replaced traditional wheels with balls. Another unique feature was the use of a single-frame grille, which was a departure from the typical Audi design. The car also had four instantly recognizable silver rings, which confirmed its identity as an Audi. Additionally, the car had a button that allowed the main character, played by Will Smith, to take control of the driving, which was a precursor to the autonomous driving concept that is now being trialed in real life."

d0587b9c2c209e36aad063fcab635045518eea1efcf100112083e21b05e27b3e,"Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How did Morley Safer describe his friendship with Molly Ivins and what did he miss about her?

Passage: Molly Ivins was the most popular liberal commentator of the last 25 years. Bill Minutaglio, author of a new biography of the tangy Texan, on why her voice is needed now more than ever.
There was Morley Safer, in a scrum of old hardball Texas liberals and graying hippies, and hanging out at his late friend Molly Ivins's favorite bar in Austin. With pitchers of Shiner everywhere, Safer was engulfed by dozens of folks wondering what the hell the woman who once had millions of faithful readers would say about health care, Afghanistan, and, yes, Rush Limbaugh’s attempt to own a piece of the Texas Blood Sport, otherwise known as professional football.
Safer, in town to donate his papers to the University of Texas, decided to drop by the book launch for my new biography of the ferociously mercurial and troubled Ivins.
Amid the weathered longhairs, musicians, underground cartoonists and civil liberties lawyers who once formed Austin's counterculture—the people Ivins called “freedom fighters”—Safer seemed merrily caught up in the nostalgia.
""She was one of the funniest and (most) thoughtful women I've ever met,"" Safer told a reporter from The Daily Texan. ""She was a great reporter, and we were good friends.""
Close to three years after her death, he's not alone in missing Ivins.
Nose around the Internet and you'll find plenty of other people still wishing she was writing—and wondering what Ivins, if she hadn't succumbed almost three years ago to cancer and a lifetime of wild personal rides, would have to say about the discourse in the twilight of 2009.
They miss the Texas cornpone flavored with a Tabasco sting, the unabashed defrocking she subjected the potentates to when they stole the stage. Maybe we need Molly—frequently described as “the only woman in the room”—more than ever before.
Her domineering father was the president of Tenneco and pals with men like Sen. John Tower, she grew up with George W. Bush, she was engaged to the son of a diplomat who did the CIA’s bidding. But after years of going to war with her controlling old man, devouring seditious issues of the muckraking Texas Observer, and furtively meeting the bravest Texas progressives, she eventually decided to raise a middle finger to all of her gilded upbringing.
It took a few years and some intense trip wires—the violent death of that fiance, her love affair with a ballsy activist, her knocking Bush's gun-toting political godfather to his knees one night in a Texas bar, her telling her bosses at The New York Times to shove it—but she finally found her calling as the most popular liberal political commentator in the last 25 years.
The fact that she did it in the Lone Star State, amid the misogynistic and Jack Daniels-fueled kingmakers, was rather startling to say the least. She fought sexual gropings by famous drunk politicos, three bouts of cancer, her own rampaging alcoholism—and plenty of death threats.
Through it all, Ivins kept the home fires burning for wandering progressives, liberal Israelites, who felt marginalized since the dawn of The Age of Reagan.
So, what would Molly Ivins say to those millions of readers today, including the ones beginning to think there has been some bait-and-switch at work with Obama?
Divorced from how you feel about her politics, most students of her work knew that she had perfected a magic act when it came to that public discourse; she talked about politics without the dour aura of either Emma Goldman or Charles Krauthammer. Nor did she scream with the raging acidity of Bill O’Reilly and Glenn Beck and their counterparts on the left. She chortled that Dubya was affable but a policy buffoon; she actually liked him personally, but hated his politics. And she spent years, and made a mint, working Bush over like his political career was one big speed bag. It was, as she sometimes told me and other folks in Austin, almost too easy.
Today, it might be a bit harder. She liked Obama and she thought he was far smarter than Bush. She’d maybe have to tap the piñata a bit more lightly in order to say what she wanted to say about Obama, about any sense of failed promises. But she would do it, and do it her way.
She would do it because she didn’t believe that a democracy was served very well by the vitriol, by the poison, by the hatred snaking through the discourse.
Bill Minutaglio is co-author, with W. Michael Smith, of Molly Ivins: A Rebel Life, released this week by PublicAffairs. He is a professor of journalism at The University of Texas at Austin and the author of several books, including George W. Bush & The Bush Family Dynasty and The President’s Counselor: The Rise to Power of Alberto Gonzales.","Morley Ivins described her friendship with Bill Minutaglio as strong and valued. She admired his work as the author of a new biography of the controversial Texan, George W. Bush, and appreciated his insights on the political landscape of Texas."

I had a family and other love ones.
How about you where do you stand?
When my heart still dies in front.
You killed the old beast in my gloom.
Fell us in love like a feather.
We stumbl’d upon each other.
Which witty poem did you inspire in me, what sincere praise did you give my words when I thought enough of you send a poem your wayWhich line did you write with my spirit surrounding you?
Why do I say I love you.?  Were you sincere when you said amen to the wisdom that I shared, were you one of those who thought your mocking, was more valuable than complianceI have lived with the resentments of scoffers.
The message for the masses is hope...so, I live  for the poems you send my wayFor, I grow strong in our relationship sailed by the winds of your encouragement, to my poets, my true friends; I truly know who you are, don't ever think I don’t!
Who Would Want To Be This Cold?
They said you needed surgery.
I drove you to the funeral home.
The arrangements were for you.
I had to wait outside that day.
I couldn't go in there.
I don't know how you made those plans.
You showed how much you cared.
You knew you wouldn't make it.
You feared the end was near.
I hate what your life did to you.
I wish you were still here.
How do you plan your funeral?
Were you as scared as I?
What were your thoughts heading to the docs?
Did you know that you would die?
I miss you more and more everyday, That's why I drink so much to take this   pain awayThe pain don't really go away it comes back, and I get so lost I don't know how to actI get lost in my thoughts of you, It kills me you can't come back ever no matter what I do, This is the hardest thing I ever had to go threwSome people say time will heal, but I know I'll be missing you still, It feels like I'm living in a bad nightmare I wish it wasn't realIf I could go back in time, I would go back and press rewindI would go to that day the 2nd of July, and make sure you were okay and you didn't dieAll I got got now are our memories and the tears I cry, To keep it together it's hard but believe me I try.
That your 'i love you' wasn't you lying""
yet all I feel is an emptiness inside..
Why did you have to leave?
Why does this have to hurt?
Cancer robbed thy life from thee..
But you went to heaven, and you went away.
That we'd die together in forevers sleep.
You didn't even say goodbye as you left me here.
I'm failing to choke down all these tears.
My face becomes moist, my sight turns to mist.
With my frown turned lips, i give you a kiss.
I try to look away as they lower your casket.
I'll try to survive, but I don't think i can las it.
I throw your favorite flowers into your grave.
Watching people throw dirt, over you they pave.
I feel no solace, I'm all alone.
As I see your name set in stone.
I feel a breeze, it's a wind so cold.
I remember the final words you had told..
You said to me, ""Don't take your life.""
I asked you, ""Why?"", as I put down the knife.
You told me you loved me, as its your final wish.
I shook my head yes, though I feel no bliss.
Why god took you away from me, but i will live on.
I hear your comforting whispers, I think its a sign.
So I know I'll see you agian when its my time.
The skeletal remains are being chalked out,while mystery and intrigue are engraven, cryptic.Lying beneath, this freshly seeded idea;upon these grounds, the words are etched,what are you looking for and how will you get it,for these are but the bare bones of a story.The key alone is in your closet, slowly turning,as you opened the creaking rusted door.You slowly peep inside the mausoleum of your mind,where cobwebs hang on every angle.Suddenly, a cold swift draft blows across your spine,as if someone has just, walked on your grave. You look up to see, all the entrapping’s laidbut then again, you are still lying in a good plot.
I’m going home to Jesus where He waits for me.
Spread your colored petals and cradle tender showers.
Ought we not to know the Tender of such lovely garden groves?
To cut away the stems of old for fuller future years.
Looking daily to their needs; so faithfully He waters.
When the Gardener comes to claim each one the earth held as its own.
He gently picks it at its peak and for His pleasure takes it home.
As God did one glorious morning, when the Perfect Rose had bloomed.
He rolled away the stone and met with Mary at the tomb.
There the sweetest Rose of Sharon rose that we die not alone.
But be gathered for a garden grove, surrounding heaven's throne.
I pray you will find.
and a peace of mind.
with God, you shall prevail.
you will never, never fail.
If not for people like YOU!

If you managed to generate very good ideas, conducted a thorough research, and organized your paper logically, but have made several grammar or spelling mistakes, your grade would be lowered. Revising and editing academic paper should be done several days prior to submission. Why? Because you need to leave your writing aside and then look at it with the fresh eye. Term paper editing is not about looking through your writing while listening to music, you need to be very attention and stay focused on numerous details.
First, take a look at your essay outline. Go through all points and try to change the order of ideas: make sure you have created a logical structure and ideas are presented either chronologically or thematically (from the least important to the most important). Locate thesis statement. Is it clear? Are there topic sentences in each paragraph? Are they related to the thesis statement? Are connections between the paragraphs clear or do you jump from one idea to another?
Essay body should contain enough supporting details contributing to thesis statement development. For example, if your topic is legalization of marijuana, you need to find at least three arguments supporting your point of view and provide rebuttal to the opposing views. Introduction and conclusion should not contain new information: introduction should provide general background information on the topic and inform the reader about your main idea, while conclusion should round up the whole essay.
Pay attention to each paragraph: it should include topic sentence and cover one point of discussion. Make sure you do not repeat the same idea twice in different parts of essay. Repeating is a sign of poor organization. Check the grammar - ask your parents or friends to assist you with essay editing . Pay attention to correct punctuation, avoid too short or too long sentences.
Revising is not the same as editing. Essay editing is about correcting mistakes, while essay revising is making major changes in your writing, adding ideas and deleting material. Revising should lead to overall paper improvement. Read your essay and if you do not like it, revise it. Ask yourself the following questions: what do I need to prove? What is the main idea? Is there enough supporting evidence? Are arguments clear and logical? Is my essay easy to understand? Have I cited all sources? Is introduction attention getting? Is conclusion logical?

Analyze the potential of nuclear fusion as a viable and sustainable source of energy in the near future, taking into account factors such as efficiency, cost, and environmental impact. Additionally, explore any challenges and obstacles that need to be overcome in order to fully realize the potential of this technology. Finally, present your findings and recommendations on the feasibility of nuclear fusion as an alternative energy source.","Nuclear fusion is a promising, virtually limitless source of energy that, if successfully harned, could potentially revolutionize the global energy landscape. However, it is still in the early stages of development and faces significant challenges before it can become a viable, sustainable energy source in the near future.

Currently, the most promising type of nuclear fusion is magnetic confinement fusion, which involves confining plasma using magnetic fields to heat it to temperatures of millions of degrees, causing it to fuse and release energy. The International Thermonuclear Experiment (ITER) is a major international project aimed at developing this technology, and is expected to begin testing in 2026.

One of the main challenges facing nuclear fusion is the development of a viable, efficient, and cost-effective method for confining the plasma. This is a complex problem, as the plasma is highly unstable and difficult to contain. Additionally, the energy required to heat the plasma to the necessary temperatures is enormous, and requires a significant amount of energy input.

Another challenge is the development of a viable method for extracting the energy produced by the fusion reaction. This is necessary in order to convert the heat generated by the fusion reaction into electricity, which can be used to power homes and businesses.

Environmental concerns are also a major obstacle to the development of nuclear fusion. The production of nuclear fusion produces radioactive waste, which must be safely stored and disposed of. Additionally, the process of extracting the energy produced by the fusion reaction produces tritium-9, which is a potent greenhouse gas and must be carefully managed to minimize its impact on the environment.

Despite these challenges, nuclear fusion has the potential to be a sustainable, virtually limitless source of energy. If the challenges of confining, heating, and extracting the energy produced by the fusion reaction can be overcome, nuclear fusion could potentially provide a clean, abundant source of energy that could help to meet the growing energy demands of a growing global population.

In order to fully realize the potential of nuclear fusion as an alternative energy source, it is necessary to continue research and development in this field. This includes improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the technology, as well as addressing environmental concerns and finding ways to safely store and dispose of radioactive waste. Additionally, it is important to continue to investigate the potential of other types of nuclear"

In your review, discuss the overarching themes and motifs of the story, the depth of the character development, the quality of the writing style, and any literary devices that the author used to enhance the narrative. Additionally, evaluate how the story affected you on a personal level and whether or not you would recommend it to others.","Title: Analysis of ""The Stranger's The Stranger

In ""The Stranger,"" the author, J.M K. Rowling, masterfully crafts a captivating and thought-provoking tale that explores the depths of the human psyche and The Stranger, a young man who is struggling with his identity and self-worth. The story is set in a dystopian society where individuals are classified into categories based on their genetic makeup, and The Stranger, who is a Chimaera, is constantly questioning his place in the world and his worth as a human.

The story is rich in overarching themes of identity, self-worth, and the struggle for individuality. The Stranger's journey to self-discovery and self-acceptance is a powerful and moving narrative that resonates with readers on a deep and personal level.

The author uses a variety of literary devices to enhance the narrative, including foreshadowing, symbolism, and irony. For example, the use of foreshadowing is evident when The Stranger first meets the Chimera, a creature who is half-human and half-animal, and who represents The Stranger's own inner turmoil and confusion. The use of symbolism is also evident in the way that the Chimera represents The Stranger's inner struggle, while the irony is seen in the way that The Stranger, who is considered a monster by society, is actually the most human-like character in the story.

Overall, ""The Stranger"" is a powerful and thought-provoking tale that explores the depths of the human psyche and the struggle for individuality. The story is well-written and masterfully crafted, with overarching themes of identity, self-worth, and the struggle for individuality that resonate with readers on a deep and personal level. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a thought-provoking and emotionally engaging story."

I've found that this change has not only been beneficial for the environment, but also for my wallet and overall well-being.

I've faced a few challenges during this time, such as waiting longer for buses during peak hours and navigating unfamiliar routes. However, I've also experienced unexpected benefits, such as saving money on gas and car maintenance, and having more time to relax and read or work on my laptop during my commute.

I've also noticed changes in my routine and habits, such as waking up earlier to catch the bus and planning my day around bus schedules. I've also made a conscious effort to walk to and from the bus stop, which has helped me get some exercise andve shared my experiences on social media and with friends and family to encourage others to consider public transportation as a sustainable and convenient option. I believe that by making this change, I've not only helped the environment, but also improved my overall quality of life."

This is a very famous and liked by one and all. It is made with khoya, but now a days many instant mixes available in the market. With the instant mix, making it is very easy, but the taste differs from the one made with khoya. Once we taste the jamun made with khoya, we won't like to have them with the ready mix. I made them with khoya this time. All of us in my family liked very much. This I made as my kids' Birthday special. I have learned it from my neighbouring friend Geetha, who makes them only with khoya. Some people add rose water also. Khoya can be made at home or we can get it from stores also. But make sure that it should be fresh and a bit tighter and harder. Add a little all purpose flour to it and make jamuns. The shop keeper who sold khoya to me revealed the trick of the trade, that they add milk powder also to it, to make more softer and tastier jamuns. So we added that also in it. Combine water, sugar and cardamom, mix till the sugar dissolves. Bring it to boil. Boil it for 8 to 10 mins. Make a thin syrup. Sugar particles should not stick to the vessel, this will the syrup crystallizes, once it cooled. Add cardamom, I added the seeds directly, not the powder of it. Combine khoya, all purpose flour and milk powder together. Mix well and make soft dough out of it. Do not knead. Make small and equal sized balls. While making them press gently between palms and make round shaped balls. Heat oil in a deep and thick bottomed kadai. Do not over heat. Simmer the stove and slowly drop each ball into it. Cook them in a low to medium flame, stirring occasionally. If we cook them on high flame, they turn into brown outside and won't cook inside. Cook them till they turn brown in color. They should get nice golden brown color. Remove them from heat and slowly immerse them in sugar syrup. Let the sugar syrup be warm, even if it cooled, warm it for 2 minutes. Keep them in the syrup till we serve. Serve sweet and soft gulab jamuns cold or hot, either way is tasty. I like spongy sweets such as Rasgulla, Gulab gamun, and cham cham. The sugary juice with essence of makes the sweet even tastier. Can you suggest some variations to make gulab jamun more unique and flavorful?","Here are some variations you can try to make gulab jamuns more unique and flavorful:

1. Adding different spices: You can add different spices such as cardamom, nutmeg, cinnamon, or cloves to give your gulab jamuns a unique flavor.

2. Adding dried fruits: You can add dried fruits such as raisins, crasins, or chopped apricots to your gulab jamuns for added texture and flavor.
3. Adding nuts: You can add chopped nuts such as almonds, pistachios, or cashews to your gulab jamuns for added crunch and flavor.
4. Adding rose water: You can add a few drops of rose water to your gulab jamuns for a floral flavor.
5. Adding saffron: You can add a pinch of saffron to your gulab jamuns for a warm, exotic flavor.
6. Adding coconut milk: You can add coconut milk to your gulab jamuns for a richer, creamier texture and flavor.
7. Adding honey: You can replace some of the sugar with honey for a more natural sweetness and added health benefits.
8. Adding coconut oil: You can add a little coconut oil to your gulab jamuns for a moister texture and flavor.

In the complaint, Nisbit said he tied Martinez's hands and feet with a cord then strangled her with another cord. After she passed out, he says he cut her throat with a knife. The complaint goes on to say he dragged her body to a culvert and partially covered her with dirt. Family and friends said the young mother of three battled depression and other mental issues her whole life and had been suicidal in the past.

In the heart of a small, forgotten town, nestled among the rolling hills and cornfields of a forgotten valley, lay a maze of corn so vast and maze that it seemed to stretch on forever. The townsfolk spoke in hushed whispers of the maze, a place where the spirits of the lost and the forgotten dwelled, and where the cornstalks whispered secrets to those who dared to listen.

One autumn day, a young woman named Lily ventured into the maze, her heart pounding with excitement and fear. She had heard the tales of the maze all her life, and now she was determined to prove that it was nothing more than a simple corn maze, designed to entertain the townsfolk during the annual harvest festival.

As she ventured deeper into the maze, the cornstalks seemed to close in around her, their leaves whispering secrets that sent shivers down her spine. The sun beat down upon her, casting long shadows that seemed to dance and writhe in the maze, and the air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decay.

Lily's heart raced as she ventured deeper, her footsteps echoing through the maze like a drumbeat in her ears. She could hear the whispers of the spirits, their voices like the rustling of leaves in the wind. She could feel their eyes upon her, their cold, unseeing gazes following her every move.

As the sun began to set, the shadows grew longer and the whispers louder. Lily's heart raced faster, her breath coming in short, panicked gasps. She could feel the cornstalks closing in around her, their leaves brushing against her skin like the touch of cold, unseeing hands.

Suddenly, she stumbled upon a clearing, the cornstalks parting to reveal a small, stone altar. Upon the altar lay a single, glowing pumpkin, its eyes glowing with an eerie, malevolent light. Lily knew that she had found the heart of the maze, the center of the spirits's power.


As she reached out to take the pumpkin, she felt a cold, unseeing hand grasp her wrist. She turned to see a figure standing behind her"

When you want something sweet, it’s hard to resist the classic chocolate chip cookie. It’s sweet. It’s comforting. It’s loyal. It’s basically your BFF.
But, for those times you don’t want your BFF to be loaded with refined sugar, simple carbs, and unhealthy fats, you’re in luck because I gave your BFF a make-over! It’s pretty much the chocolate chip cookie of your dreams. These deep dish cookies are full of protein, low in fat, grain free, and low in sugar. No joke! A typical chocolate chip cookie has about 13 grams of sugar and 2 grams of protein. Howevah, these delicious treats have a whopping 8 grams of protein and a measly 2 grams of refined sugar!
And because I am with everything else in life, I am also indecisive about wanting a super chewy cookie or a really crispy one. So, if you needed another reason to love these deep dish cookies, you get the best of both worlds with them! They have a nice, crispy edge with a soft, chewy center. The trick to getting this combo is baking them in a muffin tin. Not only is it easy and convenient, but it also keeps the cookies from spreading out while baking, giving them the chewy center. And because the batter is touching the pan all the way around, you get a nice, crispy edge. It’s like the corner piece of a pan of brownies, but all around! Once again, it’s like unicorns invaded your dreams and made your wishes come true.
And whipping up these high protein treats couldn’t be any easier. As long as you’ve got a blender or food processor you’re in business, because we’re going to puree some chickpeas. Just trust me on this one. These little gems are going to give your cookies some texture, chewiness, and replaces the flour so the cookies are grain-free. Once you’ve got them pureed, all you need to do is mix the dry ingredients, stir together the wet ingredients, and then combine that all together.
Preheat the oven to 325 F. Grease a 12 cup muffin tin.
In a food processor or blender, puree the chickpeas with the water until smooth.
In a large bowl, add the coconut flour, protein powder, sweetener, baking powder and soda, and salt.
In a seperate bowl, combine the chickpea puree, egg, yogurt, milk, oil, and vanilla. Stir or whisk until fully combined.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until fully incorporated.
Evenly distribute the batter into the prepared muffin tins. It will be about 1.5 - 2 Tbsps of dough per cookie.
Smooth out the batter so batter touches the edges of the pan, but don't press/flatten the dough.
Bake for 14 min. or until the edges of the cookies turn golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cookie dough comes out clean.
Allow the cookies to cool completely in the pan.
Feel free to top with nut butter, jam, or more chocolate and eat 'em up!

The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in detecting and preventing financial fraud in financial services is significant and it is expected to grow even more in the future. AI can be used in various ways to detect and prevent financial fraud, such as:

1. Fraud Anomlays

Fraudic Analysis: Fraudic analysis is a technique that uses machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and anomalies in financial transactions and data. It can help in detecting fraud by identifying unusual patterns of behavior, such as large, frequent, or irregular transactions, that may indicate fraudulent activity.

2. Machine Learning:

Machine learning is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that learning. In the context of financial services, machine learning can be used to predict and prevent fraud by learning from historical data of fraudulent transactions and using that knowledge to identify and flag potential fraudulent transactions in the future.

3. Natural Language Processing (NLP):

NLP is a branch of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. In financial services, NLP can be used to analyze customer communications, such as emails or chat messages, to detect potential fraudulent activity. For example, if a customer is asking for unusual or suspicious information, such as account details or personal information, that may indicate fraudulent activity.

4. Biometrics:

Biometrics is the use of unique physical or behavioral characteristics to identify individuals. In financial services, biometrics can be used to verify the identity of customers and prevent fraud by using techniques such as fingerprinting, facial recognition, or voice recognition.

5. Blockchain:

Blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent way. In financial services, blockchain can be used to prevent fraud by creating a secure and transparent record of all transactions, making it more difficult for fraudsters to manipulate the system.

Overall, the role of AI in detecting and preventing financial fraud in financial services is significant and is expected to grow in the future. By using techniques such as fraud analytics, machine learning, NLP, biometrics, and blockchain, financial institutions can improve their ability to detect and prevent fraud, protect their customers"

The correct answer is: The government policies and incentives.

The reason is that the phrase ""government"" is a conjunction that connects the two independent clauses ""government The government policies"" and ""and incentives"". The phrase ""and incentives"" is the dependent clause that explains the effect of the independent clause ""government policies"". Therefore, the correct answer is ""The government policies and incentives"".

The phrase ""The government policies"" refers to the actions or decisions made by the government, while ""incentives"" refers to the benefits or rewards that are given as a result of those policies. The phrase ""The government policies and incentives"" is a compound subject that describes the combined effect of both the government policies and the incentives.

In summary, the government policies are the actions or decisions made by the government, and the incentives are the benefits or rewards that are given as a result of those policies. The phrase ""The government policies and incentives"" is a compound subject that describes the combined effect of both the government policies and the incentives."

Sixth-year medical student, Satyen Hargovan’s honours research project has generated a check-list of the top 10 factors that influence the survival of sepsis patients.
Sepsis is a common medical condition, where chemicals released by the immune system to fight an infection trigger the inflammation and eventual shut-down of multiple organs.
Some 15,700 patients with sepsis are admitted to Australian Intensive Care Units every year. About one in five die. The cost of treating each case is more than $39,000.
“The burden of sepsis is not only in relation to patient outcomes, but also the financial cost to the healthcare system,” Mr Hargovan said.
His project, known as the Cairns Sepsis Model – 4 (CSM- 4) is designed to speed up the assessment of patients within their first four hours in ICU.
The new four-hour mortality prediction model will enable clinicians to detect patients who are at a higher risk of dying, then help to guide their treatment decisions and discussions with the patient and their family.
“Essentially it means that if a patient has a five percent chance of dying, you might treat them less invasively,” he said. “For example, you won’t rush to place them in an induced coma, or insert lines into large arteries or veins.
Mr Hargovan began his research by reviewing more than 50 mortality prediction studies, but soon realized that there was no model in the world specifically designed to predict mortality in adult sepsis patients within four hours of ICU admission.
A case history review of 500 adult sepsis patients admitted to the Cairns Hospital ICU over a four-year period identified 168 factors that could influence patient health outcomes, ranging from age, gender and socio-economic status to type of infection, degree of organ failure, vital signs, blood test results and treatment regimes.
Statistical analysis whittled the figure down to the 10 most significant factors, which include age, history of renal disease, level of consciousness, and abnormal levels of certain substances in the blood that represent varying degrees of organ dysfunction.
The mortality prediction model is inexpensive to use as it largely relies on information easily gleaned from patient history, physical examination, and blood tests that are routinely conducted on patients within their first four hours of admission to an ICU.
The next step involves testing his model on a different and larger set of patients in order to validate his research, before it can be accepted for clinical use.
“Then we’d love to create an online calculator or an app that clinicians can use easily, at the bedside, and have a result within seconds,” he said.

Associate Professor Alan de Costa. Dr de Costa will be available for interview on Tuesday in Cairns.
What are the potential benefits of using the mortality prediction model developed by Hargovan, and what is the next step in validating and implementing this model in clinical practice?","The potential benefits of using the mortality prediction model developed by Hargovan include:

1. Improved patient outcomes: By identifying patients who are at a higher risk of dying, clinicians can make more informed decisions about the level of care required, and the urgency of treatment. This can help to improve patient outcomes and potentially save lives.

2. Reduced healthcare costs: By identifying patients who are less likely to survive, clinicians can avoid costly and potentially harmful treatments, such as induced comas, inserting lines into large arteries or veins, or administering strong antibiotics. This can help to reduce healthcare costs and improve the overall efficiency of the healthcare system.

The next step in validating and implementing this model in clinical practice is to test it on a different and larger set of patients, in order to validate its accuracy and reliability. This will involve collecting data from other hospitals and using statistical analysis to compare the predictions made by the model with the actual outcomes of the patients. Once the model has been validated, it can be implemented in clinical practice, potentially saving lives and reducing healthcare costs."

Dear Diary 00h,

I awoke up in the early morning light, the sun casting a warm, golden glow over the cobblestones of the old, ivy-covered cottage. The scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling the promise of a new day. The sound of the kettle's clatter echoed through the quiet, sleepy village, a comforting sound that signaled the start of another day. The cool, damp touch of the dew on my face as I stepped out onto the porch, the taste of the morning air crisp and fresh, a taste that I always looked forward to.

The village was still shrouded in a thick mist, the trees and buildings barely visible through the swirling fog. The sound of birdsong in the distance, their melodic voices weaving through the air like a symphony. The feel of the dew on my skin, the chill of the morning air a reminder that winter was still holding on tight.

The cottage was warm and cozy, the smell of freshly baked bread wafting through the air. The sound of laughter and chatter filled the room, the taste of the warm, buttery bread on my tongue a comforting reminder of home. The touch of the soft, worn rug beneath my feet, the sight of the fire crackling in the hearth a warm, inviting glow.

As I sat down to breakfast, I couldn't help but feel a sense of peace wash over me. The village was quiet, the sun had burned off the mist, and the day was shaping up to be a beautiful one. I took a deep breath, savoring the taste of the coffee, the smell of the bread, and the sound of the birdsong in the distance. I knew that today was going to be a good one.

Sincerely,

[Your Cat]"
d2ede617a966d65a36bba1fa47b46bcf3b63a1803ac589ec9b85f9eba96a5e29,"Add eggs to these homemade dog cookies! I love this recipe and my 2 boxers, Ben and Emmy, love it more! I am making it weekly because they love it so much. The recipe is fabulous, but needed some tweaks. I doubled the recipe and added 2 eggs, used organic brown rice flour in place of wheat, and substituted 1/2 tsp garlic powder and hot water for the chicken broth. The cookies keep well in the fridge. I made these for my Yorkie/Rat Terrier mix and when they came out of the oven his tail was wagging just from the smell. He LOVES them. What can I substitute for the cheese in this dog treat recipe? I don't feed my dog cheese (let's be honest--it's basically junk food that doesn't belong in an adult dog's diet). Is there anything that you recommend substituting the cheese with? Or can I just leave it out? You could substitute the cheese for an 1/8 cup of ground flax or wheat bran. Is there something else I could use besides oats and wheat flour for this recipe? Chef's Comments ~ That's a great question. You can easily substitute the flour in this and most of our dog treat recipes. A few good grain free flours include almond flour, chickpea flour, potato flour and soy flour. Most of those flours should be available at a major grocery store. As far as substituting the oats, that's a little trickier, but it can be done. The oats are in the recipe for texture and soaking up moisture, so that's what you'll need to replace. First, you will want to halve the amount of oats and add an extra 1/2 cup of flour (or a mixture of the previously mentioned flours). Then you can add a 1/2 cup combination of unsweetened coconut, chopped peanuts and crumbled almond crackers. Or, you could replace all of the oats with the flour mixture. Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? If so, does it still need to be microwaved? Chef's Answer ~ That's a great question! :) I haven't tried this recipe with fresh spinach, but I don't see why it couldn't work. If you minced the spinach very fine, my guess is that you would not need to microwave, or otherwise cook, the spinach before adding it to the dog treat dough. Comments for Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? Is it necessary to store these cookies in a Refrigerator? Since these are cookies, can it be kept in air tight container outside? And how long would it last if this is done? Chef's Comments ~ You can get lots of tips on How to Store Dog Treats on my website. Unless you live in a very cold climate, most dog treats need to be kept indoors, and even better in the refrigerator. My dogs is algeric to grain. What can I use instead of the whole whear flour? My Husky can't have grain. What can I use besides whole wheat flour. You should put more recipes with no grain in them. Chef's Answer ~ You can replace the wheat flour in most of my dog treat recipes with a non-grain flour. For example, any type of bean flour like Chick Pea (Garbanzo Bean) flour, or ""flours"" from nuts. They are technically nut meals, but they work as flour, for example almond meal. You should be able to find grain free flours at specialty grocery stores, or at health food stores. Very good simple recipe, however wheat flour isn't something I would normally have in my cupboard. Would it be ok to use plain flour or self raising? Chef's Answer ~ Yes, you can use all purpose flour in place of the whole wheat flour. I do not recommend using self-rising flour because it has the addition of baking powder or baking soda added to it. These are things that homemade dog treats do not need. Can fresh/raw spinach be used in place of frozen spinach in a particular dog treat recipe, and does it need to be cooked beforehand?","Yes, fresh spinach can be used in place of frozen spinach in a dog treat recipe. However, it's important to cook the fresh spinach before adding it to the dough, as it will contain more moisture than frozen spinach. To cook the spinach, you can sauté it in a pan with a little bit of olive oil until it's wilted. Then, you can squeeze out the excess moisture before adding it to the dough.


As for storing the cookies, it's best to keep them in an airtight container in the refrigerator. They should last for about a week in the refrigerator, or up to 3 months in the freezer.

Regarding the flour, you can use plain flour in place of the whole wheat flour. However, I recommend using whole wheat flour if you can, as it's more nutritious and has more fiber.

Regarding self-rising flour, it's not necessary to use it in this recipe, as the baking powder and baking soda are not needed. Instead, you can add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to the dough before baking."

Generate according to: Onur Unal is Senior Art Director at Propaganda Advertising Agency in Istanbul.
It all started back in my childhood, I always interested in drawing doodles, reading comics and creating characters. I was inspired by humour magazines, and I was dreaming of become a caricature artist. I took courses on drawing technics, and after graduating from high school, I studied Graphic Design at Marmara University Fine Arts Faculty in Istanbul, Turkey.
During school, I got interested in advertising, and started an internship at Mullen Lowe Istanbul and TBWA Istanbul to practice on creative thinking and art direction. After that, I started to work for Big34, and a year after I accepted for Manajans/JWT. It was the most important years of my career.
I worked on important advertising campaigns of global clients, and won national and international advertising awards as Crystal Apple, Cannes Lions. I’m currently working for Propaganda Advertising Agency, and continue to design creative ideas for our clients.
I work for advertising agencies as an art director since 2009. I work for global and local clients as Nokia, Elidor/Sunsilk, Bosch, Shell, Turkcell, Mazda, Kia, Turkish Airlines, Hyundai, Nestle, Beko, Michelin, BMW, Red Bull, Mitsubishi Electric, Bayer, etc. I work mostly full-time at the office, and these days I also design mobile games with a freelance team.
I learnt that I should keep learning. As the technology and the design trends develop day by day, designers should stay updated. Last year I attended a design week about UX and digital design in London to learn more about digital design principles. During the week, I attended workshops at the design offices, and met designers from all over the world. It was a great experience to compare myself, and now I have new targets for my career.
I always try to find an exciting idea to get inspired. It can be anything – an interesting visual, a strong speech, a good music, anything. To find it, I make a quick research, take some notes and draw sketches. After, I brainstorm with our creative team and we share our ideas. Then the design process starts, I put on my headphones and focus on the design. After designing many alternatives, we make a discussion with our creative team and choose the best one.
The main materials I use are a blank sheet, a pen and creative thinking. All other tools and computer programs help to complete the final process.
Currently I work for Propaganda Advertising Agency. We have a beautiful office at the center of Istanbul with a nice view. I usually go to work around 9:30 am, have my breakfast while reading the news and after that the work begins. I work with a copywriter, and our team lead by a creative director. We usually make meetings at the beginning of the week with our brand executives, and we make a schedule for the deadlines. I usually work until 6:00 – 7:00 pm during the week, but under curtain some circumstances, we work overtimes and also weekends.
As my carreer began, I mostly worked on advertising campaigns, print materials, 360 ideas and digital advertising. Recently, I have been interested in UI, UX and digital design, and want to combine my creative background on advertising with the innovative projects.
During my short study in London last year, I had the chance to work and share my ideas with the designers all over the world, and I discovered things that I had never seen before.
I always believe that a designer should be in contact with all other designers and I want to cross the borders and surround myself with creative people around the world in my own studio.
