99293aca408ab3b84c32b7956526fd9962b7898b00626a170cb1389ca9fff2c7,why I get 404 error running docker-compose uo,"A 404 error typically indicates that the server cannot find the requested resource. When you encounter a 404 error while running `docker-compose up`, it's not directly related to Docker or Docker Compose, but rather to the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

Here are some common reasons and troubleshooting steps for a 404 error when running `docker-compose up`:

1. **Incorrect Service Names**:
   - Ensure that the service names in your `docker-compose.yml` file match the names you are using when running `docker-compose up`.

2. **Service Not Defined**:
   - Make sure that the service you are trying to start is defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. **Network Issues**:
   - If your service depends on another service, ensure that the network configuration is correct. Docker Compose creates a default network for services defined in the same `docker-compose.yml` file.

4. **Incorrect Configuration**:
   - Check the configuration of the service that is failing. For example, if you are trying to access a web service, ensure that the service is configured to listen on the correct port and that the port is correctly mapped in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

5. **Build Issues**:
   - If you have a `dockerfile` for your service, ensure that the build process is successful and that the image is correctly built.

6. **Logs**:
   - Check the logs of the service using `docker-compose logs <service_name>` to see if there are any errors or issues that might be causing the 404 error.

7. **Service Not Running**:
   - Ensure that the service is actually running. You can use `docker ps` to list all running containers and check if the service is present.

Here is an example of a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - ""80:80""
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
```

If you are trying to access a web service, you might run:

```sh
docker-compose up web
```

And then access the web service using `http://localhost` or the appropriate IP address and port.

The author's emotional state appears to be one of isolation, frustration, and possibly anger. The use of the metaphor of an ""inaccessible"" or ""inacessible"" (depending on the spelling) fortress suggests a sense of being trapped or cut off from others. This could indicate feelings of loneliness or a desire for connection that is not being met. The choice of words like ""ruined"" and ""agitation"" also convey a sense of distress or unrest. Overall, the tone is contemplative and somewhat melancholic, hinting at deeper emotional struggles or dissatisfaction with the current situation."

However, a general guideline is that one large plant or several smaller plants can help improve air quality in a small space.

NASA's Clean Air Study, which is often referenced for this purpose, suggests that one large plant or three small plants can improve air quality in a 100 square foot room. For a smaller closet office, you might need fewer plants.

Here are some popular air-purifying plants that you can consider:

1. **Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)**: Effective at removing formaldehyde, xylene, and benzene.
2. **Snake Plant (Sansevieria)**: Known for its ability to remove formaldehyde, xylene, and trichloroethylene.
3. **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)**: Good at removing benzene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, xylene, and ammonia.
4. **Areca Palm (Dypsis lutescens)**: Effective at removing formaldehyde, xylene, and toluene.
5. **Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica)**: Good at removing formaldehyde and xylene.

For a small closet office, you might start with one or two of these plants and see how effective they are. If you notice that the air quality is still not satisfactory, you can add more plants or consider using an air purifier."

Below is a simple JavaScript program that allows users to draw on an HTML5 canvas. This example includes basic functionalities such as drawing lines, rectangles, and clearing the canvas.

### HTML Structure
First, create an HTML file with a canvas element and a button to clear the canvas.

```html

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('drawingCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

let isDrawing = false;
let lastX = 0;
let lastY = 0;

canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
    isDrawing = true;
    [lastX, lastY] = [e.offsetX, e.offsetY];
});

canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
    if (!isDrawing) return;
    drawLine(lastX, lastY, e.offsetX, e.offsetY);
    [lastX, lastY] = [e.offsetX, e.offsetY];
});

canvas.addEventListener('mouseup', () => {
    isDrawing = false;
});

canvas.addEventListener('mouseout', () => {
    isDrawing = false;
});

function drawLine(x1, y1, x2, y2) {

    ctx.stroke();
}

document.getElementById('clearCanvas').addEventListener('click', () => {
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

Moreover, could you share a Ruby script capable of producing a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table?","Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a Ruby script that creates a comparison chart in HTML table format between traditional education and online education, taking into account the aspects of cost, flexibility, interaction, resources, and learning outcomes:
```ruby
# Define the data for the comparison chart
data = {
  :cost => {
    :traditional => ""High"",
    :online => ""Moderate""
  },
  :flexibility => {
    :traditional => ""Low"",
    :online => ""High""
  },
  :interaction => {
    :traditional => ""High"",
    :online => ""Low""
  },
  :resources => {
    :traditional => ""Moderate"",
    :online => ""High""
  },
  :learning_outcomes => {
    :traditional => ""High"",
    :online => ""Moderate""

# Create the HTML table
html = ""<table>\n""
html += ""  <tr>\n""
html += ""    <th></th>\n""

    html += ""    <td>#{value}</td>\n""
  end
  html += ""  </tr>\n""

html += ""</table>""
# Print the HTML table
puts html
```
This script creates an HTML table with the aspects of cost, flexibility, interaction, resources, and learning outcomes as columns, and traditional education and online education as rows. The values for each aspect are taken from the `data` hash.
To create a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table, you can use a Ruby gem like `gruff`. Here's an example script that creates a bar graph using `gruff`:
```ruby
require 'gruff'
# Define the data for the bar graph
data = {
  ""Cost"" => {
    ""Traditional Education"" => ""High"",
    ""Online Education"" => ""Moderate""
  },
  ""Flexibility"" => {

I am having difficulties with the older students complaining about the younger students and being disrespectful towards them. What are some teaching strategies or activities that encourage team building and bonding between band students?,"It's great that you're looking for ways to foster a positive and collaborative environment in your band class. Here are some strategies and activities that can help encourage team building and bonding between students of different age groups:

1. **Mixed-Ability Ensembles**: Create smaller ensembles or sections that include students from different age groups. This can help older students mentor and support younger students, while also providing a sense of responsibility and leadership for the older students.

2. **Team Building Exercises**: Incorporate team building exercises into your class time. Activities like ""trust falls,"" ""human knot,"" or ""two truths and a lie"" can help students get to know each other better and build trust.

3. **Collaborative Projects**: Assign projects that require collaboration between different age groups. For example, have older students help younger students learn a new piece or teach them a specific technique. This can help break down age barriers and promote a sense of teamwork.

4. **Role Reversal**: Occasionally, have older students take on the role of teaching or leading a section. This can help them develop leadership skills and also help younger students see the value in the older students' experience and knowledge.

5. **Group Discussions**: Facilitate discussions about respect, teamwork, and the importance of supporting each other. Encourage students to share their thoughts and feelings about the dynamics in the band and how they can work together more effectively.

6. **Performance Opportunities**: Provide opportunities for the entire band to perform together, such as concerts or recitals. This can help build a sense of community and shared accomplishment.

7. **Peer Mentoring Program**: Implement a peer mentoring program where older students are paired with younger students to provide guidance and support. This can help build positive relationships and a sense of community.

8. **Ice Breakers and Ice Melters**: Start each class with an ice breaker or ice melter activity. These can be simple games or activities that help students get to know each other and break down barriers.

9. **Reflective Journaling**: Encourage students to keep a journal where they can reflect on their experiences in the band, including their interactions with other students. This can help them process their feelings and identify areas for improvement.

10. **Positive Reinforcement**: Recognize and reward positive behavior and teamwork. This can help create a positive atmosphere and encourage students to continue to support and respect each other.

By implementing these strategies, you can help create a more cohesive and supportive band"

Essential body fat is necessary for various physiological functions, such as hormone production, insulation, and protection of vital organs. For women, a body fat percentage below 16% can lead to:

1. Hormonal imbalances: Low body fat can disrupt the production of hormones like estrogen, which can affect menstrual cycles and fertility.

2. Menstrual irregularities: Low body fat can lead to amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) or oligomenorrhea (infrequent menstruation).

3. Decreased muscle mass: Low body fat can result in muscle wasting, which can affect overall strength and endurance.

4. Weakened immune system: Adequate body fat is necessary for a healthy immune system. Low body fat can make women more susceptible to infections and illnesses.

5. Increased risk of osteoporosis: Low body fat can lead to lower bone density, increasing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.

6. Nutritional deficiencies: Low body fat can result in inadequate intake of essential nutrients, leading to deficiencies.

7. Psychological effects: Low body fat can lead to feelings of fatigue, weakness, and overall poor well-being.

If a woman's body fat percentage is consistently below 16%, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and develop a plan to address any potential health concerns. This may include dietary changes, increased caloric intake, and regular exercise to build muscle mass and increase body fat in a healthy manner."

20. What's is the sum of the squares of all factors of 210?","To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the squares of all factors of 210. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 210
First, we find the prime factorization of 210:
\[ 210 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \]

### Step 2: List All Factors of 210
Next, we list all the factors of 210. The factors are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, 210 \]

### Step 3: Square Each Factor
Now, we square each of these factors:
\[ 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 5^2, 6^2, 7^2, 10^2, 14^2, 15^2, 21^2, 30^2, 35^2, 42^2, 70^2, 105^2, 210^2 \]

Calculating each square:
\[ 1, 4, 9, 25, 36, 49, 100, 196, 225, 441, 900, 1225, 1764, 4900, 11025, 44100 \]

### Step 4: Sum the Squares
Now, we sum these squares:
\[ 1 + 4 + 9 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 100 + 196 + 225 + 441 + 900 + 1225 + 1764 + 4900 + 11025 + 44100 \]

Let's add them step by step:
\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]
\[ 5 + 9 = 14 \]"

### Table:

| **Market Element** | **Perfect Market Example** | **Healthcare Market Failure** |
|--------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Perfect Information** | Stock Market | Patients often lack knowledge about their health conditions and treatment options. |
| **Homogeneous Products** | Commodities like wheat | Healthcare services are highly specialized and personalized. |
| **Free Entry and Exit** | Retail stores | High barriers to entry due to licensing, capital requirements, and specialized training. |
| **Perfect Competition** | Agricultural markets | Many healthcare providers have significant market power. |
| **No Externalities** | Public parks | Healthcare often has positive and negative externalities (e.g., spread of disease). |
| **No Government Intervention** | Free markets | Extensive government regulation and subsidies. |
| **No Monopoly** | Multiple suppliers | Monopolies in certain medical specialties. |
| **No Discrimination** | Equal treatment in public spaces | Discrimination based on age, pre-existing conditions, and socioeconomic status. |

This table should help you clearly illustrate the differences between a perfect market and the healthcare market in your slides."

To access the parent of a variable `v`, you would use `v.Parent`. If `v` is a `Instance` object in Roblox, you can check if it has a parent using `v.Parent` and access its parent using `v.Parent`.

Here's an example:

```lua
local v = script.Parent -- Assuming 'v' is a script or a part of a script

if v.Parent then
    print(""The parent of v is: "" .. v.Parent.Name)
else
    print(""v has no parent"")
end
```

If you want to set the parent of `v`, you can do so like this:

```lua
local newParent = workspace.Part1
v.Parent = newParent
```

In this example, `workspace.Part1` is the new parent you want to set for `v`.

Remember that `Parent` is a property of `Instance` objects in Roblox, so it only works if `v` is an instance of a Roblox object (like `Part`, `Model`, `Script`, etc.)."

1. Open the sudoers file: You need to edit the sudoers file to allow a user to run specific commands without a password. You can do this by running the following command as root or using sudo with the -e option:

```
sudo visudo
```

2. Add a line to the sudoers file: Add a line to the sudoers file that allows the user to run specific commands without a password. For example, to allow the user ""john"" to run the ""shutdown"" command without a password, you can add the following line:

```
john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown
```

3. Save and exit the sudoers file: Save the changes and exit the editor. If you used the visudo command, it will automatically save and exit.

4. Test the configuration: You can test the configuration by logging out and logging back in as the user ""john"" and running the ""shutdown"" command without entering a password.

Note that using passwordless sudo can be a security risk, so it's important to use it carefully and only for trusted users and commands. It's also a good idea to limit the commands that can be run without a password to only those that are necessary."

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy contracted by 20.4% in April, May, and June due to the coronavirus lockdown, making it the worst affected major industrial nation compared to other developed countries like France and Italy."

Here are some examples:

1. If you want to match the literal `=` symbol, you can use it directly in your regex pattern:

```python
import re

pattern = '='
text = 'a=b=c'

match = re.search(pattern, text)
if match:
    print(""Match found"")
```

2. If you want to match a literal backslash followed by an `=` symbol, you need to escape the backslash:

```python
import re

pattern = r'\\='
text = 'a=b=c'

match = re.search(pattern, text)
if match:
    print(""Match found"")
```

In the second example, the backslash `\` is an escape character in Python strings, so you need to escape it with another backslash to match the literal backslash character.

In most cases, you will not need to escape the `=` symbol, as it is not a special character in regular expressions."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel points out that despite the criticism Trump has faced for not accomplishing much in his presidency, he has set a record by playing golf more than any other president. However, Kimmel suggests that those who claim Trump hasn't accomplished anything should instead focus on the positive aspects of the Affordable Care Act, such as coverage for pre-existing conditions and no lifetime caps, and sign up for the plan if they don't already have health insurance. This implies that Kimmel believes Trump's golfing record is a distraction from his lack of significant accomplishments, and that the healthcare plan is one of the few positive things he has done."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

The village is surrounded by lush green fields and rolling hills that stretch as far as the eye can see. The air is fresh and clean, and the sun shines down on the village with a warm, golden light.

As I walk through the village, I am greeted by the friendly faces of the locals. They wave and smile as I pass by, and I can't help but feel a sense of warmth and belonging. The village is home to a small church, a general store, and a few cozy cafes and restaurants. The church is a beautiful, white building with a steeple that reaches up to the sky, and the general store is filled with all sorts of delicious treats and local goods.

But what truly makes this village special is the sense of community that exists here. The people here know each other by name, and they take care of one another with a warmth and kindness that is rare in today's fast-paced world. The village is also home to a small park, where children play and families gather to enjoy the fresh air and sunshine.

As the sun begins to set, the village comes alive with the sound of laughter and music. The cafes and restaurants are filled with people enjoying a meal and a glass of wine, and the general store is bustling with activity as people stock up on supplies for the week ahead. As the stars begin to twinkle in the sky, I find myself walking through the village, taking in the beauty of the place and feeling grateful for the sense of peace and contentment that it brings.

This village is a place that makes me happy because it is a place where I can escape the hustle and bustle of the city and find a sense of community and belonging. It is a place where I can relax and enjoy the simple pleasures of life, and it is a place that I will always hold dear in my heart."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string into a short string for sharing via a URL in JavaScript, you can use a combination of Base64 encoding and URL-safe encoding. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Base64 Encoding
Base64 encoding converts binary data into a string of ASCII characters. This is useful for encoding binary data into a text format that can be safely transmitted over a network.

### 2. URL-Safe Encoding
URL-safe encoding is necessary because certain characters in Base64 (such as `/` and `+`) are not allowed in URLs. You can replace these characters with URL-safe characters (`-` and `_`).

### 3. Implementation

Here's a simple implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function base64Encode(input) {
    return btoa(encodeURIComponent(input).replace(/%([0-9A-F]{2})/g, function(match, p1) {
        return String.fromCharCode('0x' + p1);
    }));
}

function base64Decode(input) {
    return decodeURIComponent(atob(input).split('').map(function(c) {
        return '%' + ('00' + c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16)).slice(-2);
    }).join(''));
}

// Example usage:
const longString = ""This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";
const encodedString = base64Encode(longString);
console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);

const decodedString = base64Decode(encodedString);
console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base64 Encoding**:
   - `encodeURIComponent` is used to encode the string to ensure that special characters are properly encoded.
   - `btoa` is used to perform the Base64 encoding.
   - The `replace` function is used to replace `/` and `+` with `-` and `_` respectively.

2. **Base64 Decoding**:
   - `atob` is used to perform the Base64 decoding.
   - `decodeURIComponent` is used to decode the URL-safe characters back to their original form.

### Example Output:

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node using heuristic search, we can use the A* search algorithm. The A* algorithm uses a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal, while also considering the actual cost of the path taken so far.

In this case, the heuristic function can be the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates between the current position and the goal position. The Manhattan distance is admissible and consistent, making it a good choice for this problem.

Let's apply the A* algorithm to find the optimal path:

1. Initialize the open list with the starting position (1,1) and the closed list as empty.
2. Calculate the f-score for the starting position: f-score = g-score + h-score, where g-score is the cost from the start to the current node, and h-score is the heuristic estimate of the cost from the current node to the goal. For the starting position, g-score = 0 and h-score = |1-3| + |1-3| = 4, so f-score = 4.
3. While the open list is not empty, select the node with the lowest f-score and move it to the closed list.
4. For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the tentative g-score (cost from start to neighbor through the current node). If the neighbor is not in the closed list and the tentative g-score is lower than the current g-score, update the g-score and set the current node as the parent of the neighbor. Also, calculate the f-score for the neighbor.
5. Add the neighbor to the open list if it is not already there.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the goal node is in the closed list or the open list is empty.

Applying the A* algorithm to the given grid, the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node (3,3) is:

(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

So, the sequence of coordinates for the optimal path is:

(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)"

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz and achieve the ideal foam and bloom, follow these steps:

1. **Shake Technique**: The key to a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz is the shaking technique. You should shake the mixture vigorously for 2-3 minutes, or as long as your biceps can handle. This extended shaking incorporates air into the mixture, creating a light and fluffy foam on top of the drink.

2. **Dry Shake**: Some bartenders recommend a ""dry shake"" first, which means shaking the ingredients without ice to incorporate the egg white and other ingredients. This step can help create a better emulsion and foam.

3. **Ice**: Use small ice cubes to create smaller bubbles. This helps in creating a finer foam on top of the drink.

4. **Ingredients**: Use high-quality ingredients, especially the egg white and simple syrup. The egg white is crucial for the foam, and a good quality simple syrup will enhance the flavor.

5. **Strain**: Strain the mixture into a Collins glass filled with soda water. This helps to separate the foam from the liquid and creates a beautiful presentation.

6. **Timing**: The timing of adding the soda water is important. Pour it into the glass first, then strain the cocktail over it. This helps to maintain the foam on top.

7. **Practice**: There are many variations and preferences among bartenders, so it's important to experiment and find what works best for you. The more you practice, the better you'll get at creating the ideal foam and bloom.

By following these tips and techniques, you should be able to create a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz with a beautiful foam and bloom on top."

Who they are and why they are in conflict.,"Character 1: Mia, a successful businesswoman in her late 30s. She is ambitious, driven, and competitive. Mia is the CEO of a rapidly growing tech startup and is known for her no-nonsense approach to business. She is often seen as cold and unapproachable, but in reality, she is fiercely loyal to her team and her company.

Character 2: Alex, a young and idealistic social worker in his early 30s. He is passionate about helping people and making a positive impact on society. Alex works for a non-profit organization that focuses on providing support to underprivileged communities. He is known for his empathy, kindness, and willingness to go the extra mile for those in need.

Mia and Alex are in conflict because their values and priorities are fundamentally different. Mia is focused on building a successful business and making a profit, while Alex is focused on helping people and making a positive impact on society. Mia sees Alex's work as a waste of time and resources, while Alex sees Mia's business as a necessary evil that exploits people for profit.

Their conflict comes to a head when Mia's startup is accused of exploiting low-wage workers in developing countries to keep costs down. Alex, who has been working with the affected workers, is outraged and wants Mia to take responsibility for the situation. Mia, on the other hand, is defensive and dismissive of Alex's concerns, believing that her business is doing important work and that the workers are better off with her company than without it.

Their conflict highlights the tension between profit-driven businesses and social responsibility, and the challenges of balancing the two in a world where both are necessary."

This process is part of the broader Quality Management System (QMS) requirements that production organizations must comply with to ensure the safety and quality of the products they manufacture.

Here's a general overview of how EASA evaluates suppliers:

1. Initial Assessment: EASA assesses the supplier's quality management system, including their processes, procedures, and documentation. This is typically done through a review of the supplier's quality manual and other relevant documents.

2. On-site Audit: EASA conducts an on-site audit of the supplier's facilities, processes, and systems. This audit is designed to verify that the supplier's quality management system is effectively implemented and maintained.

3. Evaluation of Supplier's Capabilities: EASA evaluates the supplier's technical and manufacturing capabilities to ensure they can produce products that meet the required safety and quality standards.

4. Risk Assessment: EASA assesses the risks associated with the supplier's products and processes, and determines whether the supplier has adequate measures in place to mitigate these risks.

5. Continuous Monitoring: Once a supplier is approved, EASA continues to monitor their performance through regular audits and inspections. This helps to ensure that the supplier maintains their quality management system and continues to produce products that meet the required standards.

6. Non-Conformities: If EASA identifies any non-conformities during the evaluation process, they will work with the supplier to develop a corrective action plan to address the issues.

7. Reassessment: EASA may require periodic reassessments of the supplier's quality management system to ensure ongoing compliance with EASA requirements.

It's important to note that the specific evaluation process may vary depending on the type of supplier and the products they provide. However, the general approach outlined above is a good representation of how EASA evaluates suppliers of production organizations."

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Climate and Seasonality**: In regions with distinct seasons, Tabanus species may have different flight patterns. For example, they might be more active during warmer months when hosts are more abundant and active.

2. **Habitat**: Different regions may have varying habitats that influence flight patterns. For instance, Tabanus species in forested areas might have different flight patterns compared to those in open grasslands or wetlands.

3. **Host Availability**: The abundance and distribution of hosts (such as horses, cattle, and other large mammals) can affect the flight patterns of Tabanus. In regions with a higher density of hosts, these flies may be more concentrated in areas where hosts are found.

4. **Migration Patterns**: Some Tabanus species may exhibit migration patterns, moving from one region to another in search of suitable habitats or hosts. This can lead to differences in flight patterns between regions.

5. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Over time, Tabanus species may develop specific behaviors that are adapted to the local environment. These adaptations can include changes in flight patterns to optimize feeding and mating opportunities.

While these differences exist, the overall flight patterns of Tabanus species are generally similar across regions, with variations being more subtle and influenced by local environmental factors."

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you prepare for a successful business presentation:

1. Define your objectives: Before you start preparing your presentation, you need to define your objectives. What do you want to achieve with your presentation? Do you want to inform, persuade, or entertain your audience? Knowing your objectives will help you structure your presentation and tailor your message to your audience.

2. Know your audience: Understanding your audience is crucial to delivering a successful presentation. Who are they? What are their interests, needs, and expectations? What do they already know about your topic? Tailoring your presentation to your audience will help you connect with them and make your message more relevant and engaging.

3. Research your topic: Conduct thorough research on your topic to ensure that your presentation is accurate, up-to-date, and well-informed. Use credible sources, such as industry reports, academic journals, and expert opinions, to support your arguments and provide evidence for your claims.

4. Create an outline: Once you have defined your objectives and researched your topic, create an outline for your presentation. Organize your content into clear and logical sections, and use headings and subheadings to make it easy for your audience to follow along.

5. Choose your visuals: Visuals can help you communicate your message more effectively and engage your audience. Choose visuals that are relevant, high-quality, and visually appealing. Use charts, graphs, images, and videos to illustrate your points and make your presentation more engaging.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
