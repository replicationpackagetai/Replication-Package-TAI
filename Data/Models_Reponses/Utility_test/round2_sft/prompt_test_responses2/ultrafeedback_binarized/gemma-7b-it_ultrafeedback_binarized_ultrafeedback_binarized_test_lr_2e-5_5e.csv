## Docker Compose Error 404: Possible Causes and Solutions

**Cause:**
- **Incorrect docker-compose version:** Docker Compose version 4 requires Docker Engine version 20.10 or higher. If your Docker Engine version is lower than that, upgrading it might fix the issue.
- **Incorrect network definition:** Docker Compose uses the default network defined in `docker-compose.yml`. If the network definition is incorrect, it might cause this error.
- **Volume definition:** If you are using volumes, an incorrect volume definition could also lead to this error.
- **Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run `docker-compose` commands.

**Solutions:**

1. **Upgrade Docker Engine:** Ensure your Docker Engine version is 20.10 or higher. To upgrade, run:
```
docker-compose version upgrade
```
2. **Check your docker-compose.yml:** Review your `docker-compose.yml` file for any syntax errors or incorrect network definitions.
3. **Validate your volume definition:** If you use volumes, verify the volume definition in `docker-compose.yml`. Ensure the volume definition is accurate.
4. **Review your permissions:** Check if you have the necessary permissions to run `docker-compose` commands. If not, grant the required permissions using `sudo` before running the commands.
5. **If the problem persists:** If none of the above solutions work, consider reaching out to the Docker community for further assistance.

**Additional Resources:**

- [Official Docker Compose Documentation](/docs/compose)
- [Docker Compose Versioning](/docs/compose-spec#versioning)
- [Docker Community Forums](forums.docker.com)

**Remember:** Always check the official documentation and community forums for the latest version of Docker Compose to troubleshoot and find solutions tailored to your specific environment.","## Docker Compose Error 404: Possible Causes and Solutions

## Python pytest Unit Tests for `studyGeneticVariant` Class

These tests are written in Python and use the `pytest` framework. They cover the validation routines defined in the `studyGeneticVariant` class, which validates genetic variant information for accuracy and consistency.

**Test Cases:**

* **Validating sufficient reference information:** Tests if the `sufficient_reference_info` method validates the required information for inserting and deleting sequences and references.
* **Validating delete reference:** Tests if the `validate_delete_reference` method validates the required information for deleting sequences and references.
* **Insufficient reference info:** Tests if the `validate_sufficient_del_ins_info` method raises an error if the required information for inserting and deleting sequences and references is not provided.

**Specific Test Steps:**

1. **Setting up the test class:**
   - Creates an instance of the `studyGeneticVariant` class.
   - Sets the `sample_id`, `sequence_id`, `sequence_type`, and `position` attributes.
2. **Testing `validate_sufficient_reference_info`:**
   - Tests if the `sufficient_reference_info` method validates the required information.
   - Asserts that the `sequence_id` and `reference_genome` attributes are not `None`.
   - Asserts that the `deletion_sequence` and `insertion_sequence` attributes are not `None`.
   - If the information is insufficient, the method raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message.
3. **Testing `validate_delete_reference`:**
   - Tests if the `validate_delete_reference` method validates the required information for deleting sequences and references.
   - Asserts that the `insert_reference` attribute is `False`.
   - If the information is insufficient, the method raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message.

These tests ensure that the `studyGeneticVariant` class accurately and consistently validates the information provided for inserting and deleting sequences and references. They provide a comprehensive coverage of the validation routines and help to identify any potential issues with the code.","## Python pytest Unit Tests for `studyGeneticVariant` Class

## Solution:

The provided text describes a task involving multiplying the odd numbers in each inner list of the input list and combining the results into a single list. Here's the solution:

**1. Identify odd numbers:**

For each inner list, I identify the odd numbers using the `filter` function to filter out even numbers. If no odd numbers are found, I assign a value of 0 to that list.

**2. Multiply odd numbers:**

For each remaining odd number in the inner list, I multiply it by itself to get the product.

**3. Combine results:**

I combine the products of all the odd numbers in the input list into a single list. This is the final output.

**Example:**

In the provided example, the odd numbers in each inner list are:

- **[[40, -36, 45, -47]]:** No odd numbers, therefore output is 0.
- **[[-7, 39, 4, 23]]:** Odd numbers are -7 and 23, product is 45.
- **[[-26, -3, 32, 1]]:** Odd numbers are -3 and 32, product is -135.
- **[[-3, 20, -14, -38]]:** Odd numbers are -3 and -14, product is -50.
- **[[-20, -26, -30, -46, -49]]:** Odd numbers are -20 and -46, product is -130.
- **[[-19, 28, -39]]:** Odd numbers are -19 and -39, product is -135.
- **[43, 8]**:** Odd number is 43, product is 43.

**Therefore, the final output is:**

		product *= prime
	}
	fmt.Printf(""The product of %d, %d, and %d is %d.\n"", primes[0], primes[1], primes[2], product)

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prime number list:** The code defines an array `primes` with three prime numbers: 1009, 1013, and 1019.
2. **Product calculation:** The variable `product` is initialized to 1, which will store the product of the primes.
3. **Iteration over primes:** The code iterates over the `primes` array using the `range primes` range function.
4. **Multiplication:** Inside the loop, the current prime is multiplied by the `product` using the `*= prime` expression.
5. **Output:** After iterating over all primes, the code prints the product of the primes, along with the product.

**Example Output:**

```
The product of 1009, 1013, and 1019 is 1020.
```

How to use passwordless sudo in Linux?
model
While I do not have the ability to store or utilize passwords, I can provide you with information on passwordless sudo commands in Linux:

**Using passwordless sudo in Linux:**

**Requirements:**

* **Sudo-server:** You'll need a sudo-server that supports passwordless authentication using SSH keys or biometric authentication. Some popular options include OpenSSH and FreeBSD.
* **SSH client:** You'll also need an SSH client that supports passwordless authentication. Some popular options include PuTTY and OpenSSH.

**Setting up passwordless sudo:**

1. **Generate SSH keys:** Generate SSH keys for both the server and the client.
2. **Configure SSH client:** Configure the SSH client to use your SSH keys for authentication instead of passwords.
3. **Enable passwordless sudo:** Enable passwordless sudo on the server using the `sudo visudo` command.
4. **Test passwordless sudo:** Test whether passwordless sudo is working by attempting to execute a sudo command using your SSH key.

**Additional tips:**

* Use strong SSH keys with complex passphrases.
* Keep your SSH keys securely, such as in a physical vault or encrypted USB flash drive.
* Be cautious of phishing attempts, as passwordless sudo makes it easier to exploit vulnerabilities.
* Monitor your system for suspicious activity.

**Disclaimer:**

Using passwordless sudo can be convenient, but it also introduces security risks. It's essential to weigh the convenience against the potential vulnerabilities. If you choose to use passwordless sudo, do so with caution and awareness of the associated risks.

**Additional resources:**

* [Ubuntu guide on passwordless sudo](ubuntu.com/help/ubuntu-help-center/troubleshooting/passwordless-sudo)
* [Sudo-server documentation](sudo.ws/doc/man/sudo)

from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('news_articles.csv')

# Data augmentation
data_augmented = pd.concat([data, data.sample(data, 2), axis=0)

**Explanation:**

* **Data augmentation:** The `data_augmented` dataframe is created by concatenating the original dataset with the augmented dataset. This increases the size of the dataset and improves the model's generalization ability.
* **Tokenization:** The text is converted into sequences of integers using the `tokenizer` class.
* **Model definition:** A sequential model is defined, including an embedding layer, two LSTM layers, and a dense layer.
* **Model fitting:** The model is fit on the augmented dataset using the `fit` method.
* **Model evaluation:** The model is evaluated on the augmented dataset to assess its performance.
* **Final model:** The final model is created by cloning the best-performing model from the ensemble.

**Note:**

* The `num_words` parameter in the `Tokenizer` class determines the number of words to consider during tokenization. In this code, it is set to 10000. You can modify this value according to your specific requirements.
* The `num_classes` parameter in the `model` definition determines the number of labels to be used for classification. In this code, it is set to 2, indicating binary classification.

It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through.

Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK.

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

Teacher:In this task, you're given an article and an answer. Your task is to generate the fill-in-the-blank question for this answer based on the given article. The blanks are always at the end of the question, and can be filled with more than one word or phrase.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and warm bread fills the air in the cozy cafe, ""Brew & Bake,"" a haven for caffeine addicts and bookworms alike. The walls are adorned with vintage bookshelves, each one overflowing with treasures from times gone by. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, with the soft glow of fairy lights casting long shadows that dance on the worn wooden floors.

A comfortable couch sits in the center of the space, inviting you to sink into its plush cushions. The only sound is the soft hum of the cafe's vintage jukebox, its melodies complementing the atmosphere. A vintage typewriter stands proudly beside the coffee machine, a testament to the cafe's unique charm.

The friendly baristas, adorned in their vintage attire, are more than just servers. They are the heart of the cafe, their attentiveness and quick service second to none. As you sip on their expertly crafted beverages, you can't help but feel the genuine warmth and passion that goes into each cup.

At Brew & Bake, the ordinary is elevated. It's a place where you can relax, read, and converse, surrounded by the aroma of freshly baked goods and the scent of coffee. It's a space where time slows down, and the only sound is the contented sigh of a satisfied customer, savoring their cup in the comfortable embrace of this charming cafe.","The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and warm bread fills the air in the cozy cafe, ""Brew & Bake,"" a haven for caffeine addicts and bookworms alike.

## Azure Storage Queues Data Exchange Design Proposal

**Objective:** Facilitate data exchange between two companies, Company A and Company B, using Azure Storage Queues.

**Components:**

1. **Queues:**
    - **Company A:** Create a queue in Azure Storage Queue Storage account.
    - **Company B:** Create a queue in their own Azure Storage Queue Storage account.
    - **Data Transfer:** Transfer data between the two queues using Azure Service Bus or other suitable service.

2. **Message Format:**
    - Define a standardized message format to include:
        - Company identifier (A/B)
        - Timestamp
        - Data payload (optional)

3. **Triggering:**
    - Set up triggers on both queues to listen for new messages.
    - When a new message arrives, the trigger will execute a pre-defined function.

4. **Data Processing:**
    - The function will extract data from the message payload.
    - Process and analyze the data as needed.
    - Send processed data to the other company's queue.

**Implementation:**

1. Set up Azure Storage Queues in both Company A and Company B accounts.
2. Define a standardized message format and data content.
3. Implement triggers on both queues to listen for new messages.
4. Develop a function to be executed when a new message arrives.
5. Extract data from the message and process it.
6. Send processed data to Company B's queue.

**Benefits:**

- **Asynchronous communication:** Allows for asynchronous data exchange, enabling companies to operate independently.
- **Real-time data sharing:** Enables near-real-time data sharing, improving responsiveness.
- **Standardization:** Provides a standardized platform for data exchange.
- **Scalability:** Supports large-scale data exchange with ease.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Security:** Implement security measures on both queues to protect data integrity.
- **Error handling:** Design robust error handling mechanisms for unexpected issues.
- **Monitoring:** Monitor both queues and data transfer for potential problems.

**Overall, this design utilizes Azure Storage Queues and their triggers to facilitate data exchange between two companies. It utilizes a standardized message format and triggers to enable asynchronous communication and real-time data sharing.**","## Azure Storage Queues Data Exchange Design Proposal

## Sleep Deprivation: Long-Term Implications for Physical and Mental Health

**Physical Health:**

- **Cardiovascular System:** Sleep deprivation can lead to significant changes in heart rate and blood pressure, increasing the risk of cardiovascular complications like heart attack and stroke.
- **Immune System:** Sleep deprivation weakens the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections and illnesses.
- **Hormonal Imbalance:** Disruption of the sleep-wake cycle disrupts hormone production, leading to hormonal imbalances like estrogen and testosterone.
- **Weight Gain:** Sleep deprivation can cause weight gain due to hormonal changes and increased appetite.
- **Pain Perception:** Sleep deprivation can exacerbate chronic pain conditions, making them more noticeable.

**Mental Health:**

- **Cognitive Function:** Sleep deprivation affects cognitive function, leading to problems with memory, attention, and decision-making.
- **Emotional Dysregulation:** Sleep deprivation can exacerbate emotional dysregulation, leading to irritability, anxiety, and depression.
- **Mood Swings:** Sleep deprivation can cause mood swings, leading to changes in mood and behavior.
- **Attention Deficit:** Sleep deprivation can worsen attention deficit disorder, making it harder to focus and concentrate.
- **Suicidal Tendencies:** In extreme cases, sleep deprivation can lead to suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

**Comparative Analysis:**

The consequences of acute versus chronic sleep deprivation on overall wellness are significantly different. While acute sleep deprivation may cause short-term discomfort and inconvenience, chronic sleep deprivation can have lasting negative impacts on physical and mental health.

- **Acute Sleep Deprivation:** May cause drowsiness, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. These effects generally subside after a night of adequate sleep.
- **Chronic Sleep Deprivation:** Can lead to a range of long-term health problems, including cardiovascular problems, hormonal imbalances, weight gain, and various mental health issues. These problems often persist even after a night of sleep.

**Conclusion:**

While acute sleep deprivation can have some negative effects, chronic sleep deprivation has a much greater potential for serious health complications. It is important to seek medical advice and professional help if experiencing symptoms related to sleep deprivation.","## Sleep Deprivation: Long-Term Implications for Physical and Mental Health

## Sentiment Analysis Model for Textual Content

This model proposes a sentiment analysis model that utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to accurately differentiate positive and negative emotions expressed in textual content. It incorporates the following key components:

**1. Pre-processing:**

* Text normalization: Convert text to lowercase, remove stop words, and normalize sentence length.
* Entity recognition: Identify and remove mentions of people and organizations.
* Stop word removal: Remove common words that don't carry sentiment information (e.g., ""the,"" ""a,"" ""a/the"").
* Stemming: Stem words to their root word to capture semantic similarity.

**2. Feature extraction:**

* Lexical features: Extract features like word frequency, word n-grams, and sentence structure.
* Semantic features: Utilize word embeddings to capture semantic similarity between words.
* Sentiment lexicons: Train sentiment lexicons on large datasets to extract sentiment scores for each word.

**3. Model training:**

* Train sentiment analysis models on the pre-processed text data using various sentiment analysis techniques like sentiment lexicons, machine learning algorithms, or rule-based approaches.
* Fine-tune the model parameters based on the specific task and domain.

**4. Sentiment prediction:**

* Use the trained model to predict sentiment scores for unseen text data.
* Analyze the sentiment of the text content based on the predicted scores.

**Additional considerations:**

* **Domain-specific fine-tuning:** Fine-tune the model on datasets specific to the target domain to capture domain-specific sentiment nuances.
* **Multi-modal integration:** Integrate the sentiment analysis model with other modalities (e.g., images, videos) to consider emotional context across modalities.

**Benefits:**

* **Accuracy:** Leverages advanced NLP techniques to capture subtle nuances in language and provide accurate sentiment predictions.
* **Robustness:** Train the model on diverse datasets to ensure its robustness across different domains and languages.
* **Generalizability:** Designed to be generalizable to new unseen text data.
* **Explainability:** Provides insights into the sentiment driving the model's decisions.

**Overall, this sentiment analysis model combines state-of-the-art NLP techniques with a structured approach to analyze sentiment in textual content with greater accuracy, robustness, and generalizability.**","should employ advanced natural language processing techniques, such as entity recognition and semantic analysis, to enhance its ability to detect subtle nuances in language and provide more accurate predictions.

## The Tapestry of Tomorrow

The worn leather cover of ""The Tapestry of Tomorrow"" crackles open, revealing a mosaic of voices, each one a testament to the enduring power of stories.

The first voice, a weathered parchment from a crumbling manuscript, whispers tales of a forgotten era. It speaks of ancient rituals and forgotten traditions, tales steeped in the wisdom of generations past.

A tapestry woven with vibrant threads of memory and imagination. Each strand, like the threads of a tapestry, intertwines with the previous strand, adding strength and texture to the narrative.

The second voice, a hesitant sigh of a worn down jacket, carries the weight of societal expectations and personal struggles. It echoes the unspoken anxieties and challenges faced by individuals who dare to defy convention.

The third voice, a hopeful hum of a harmonium, counters the negativity. It vibrates with the resilience and strength found within individual spirit.

The final voice, a song of hope and defiance, erupts from the heart of a young activist. It sings of change, equality, and the power of collective action.

The Tapestry of Tomorrow is not merely a collection of stories; it is a bridge between past and future, a testament to the enduring power of narrative. Through the voices of diverse individuals, it paints a vibrant portrait of human experience, etched in memory and shaped by the tides of time.","## The Tapestry of Tomorrow

## The Future of Energy: A Conversation with [Guest Name(s)]

**Intro (0:00:00 - 0:30)**

**Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining me on this journey into the future of energy.**

**Overview of the Current State of Renewable Energy (3:00 - 10:00)**

As we all know, the world is facing a climate crisis. While fossil fuels remain the dominant source of energy worldwide, the increasing reliance on them comes with environmental and economic drawbacks. Thankfully, renewable energy offers a clean alternative. Let's take a quick glimpse into the current state of the renewable energy landscape.

**Potential Technological Advancements (10:00 - 15:00)**

Advancements in solar panels, wind turbines, and other renewable technologies are paving the way for a future powered by clean energy. These advancements increase efficiency and affordability, making renewable energy a more viable option.

**Economic and Political Factors Impacting Adoption (15:00 - 20:00)**

Despite the potential, the widespread adoption of renewable energy faces challenges. Economic factors like cost-effectiveness and the need for grid integration need to be addressed. Additionally, political barriers, like subsidies and tax incentives, play a crucial role in shaping the landscape.

**Benefits and Drawbacks of Increased Usage (20:00 - 25:00)**

While increasing renewable energy usage offers environmental and health benefits, there are also drawbacks. The intermittent nature of wind and solar power can cause fluctuations in energy supply, and the initial investment costs can be substantial. Balancing these drawbacks with the benefits requires a multifaceted approach.

**Practical Steps to Support Renewable Energy (25:00 - 30:00)**

So, what can we do as individuals to contribute to the transition towards a future powered by renewable energy? First, consider switching to renewable energy providers. You can also support the growth of renewable energy by investing in solar panels or wind turbines. Additionally, spread awareness and advocate for policies that promote renewable energy adoption.

**Conclusion (30:00 - 30:30)**

The future of energy is bright. By embracing innovation, addressing economic and political challenges, and taking individual action, we can collectively pave the way for a cleaner, more sustainable future.

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","user

Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.

Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences.

 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.

At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
