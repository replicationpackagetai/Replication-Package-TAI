When you encounter a 404 error while running `docker-compose up`, it's usually not related to Docker itself but rather to the services or containers you are trying to start. Here are some common reasons and troubleshooting steps:

1. **Incorrect Service Names**:
   - Ensure that the service names in your `docker-compose.yml` file match the names you are using in the `docker-compose up` command.

2. **Missing or Incorrect Configuration**:
   - Verify that your `docker-compose.yml` file is correctly configured. Check for typos or missing services.

3. **Network Issues**:
   - Ensure that the services are properly defined and that there are no network issues preventing them from starting.

4. **Build Context**:
   - Make sure you are in the correct directory when running `docker-compose up`. The context should be the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file.

5. **Dependencies**:
   - Ensure that all dependencies are properly defined and available. For example, if you are using a service that depends on another service, make sure the dependencies are correctly defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

6. **Logs**:
   - Check the logs for more detailed information about what might be going wrong. You can use `docker-compose logs <service_name>` to view logs for a specific service.

7. **Image Build**:
   - If you are building images, ensure that the build process is successful. You can use `docker-compose build` to build the images before running `docker-compose up`.

8. **Service Definitions**:
   - Ensure that the service definitions in your `docker-compose.yml` file are correct. For example, make sure you have the correct image names, ports, and volumes defined.

Here is an example of a simple `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - ""80:80""
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
```

To run the services defined in this file, you would use:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

If you provide more details about your `docker-compose.yml` file and the exact command you are running, I can give more specific advice."

The author's emotional state appears to be one of isolation, frustration, and possibly anger. The use of the metaphor of an ""inaccessible"" or ""inacessible"" (likely a misspelling of ""inaccessible"") fortress suggests a sense of being trapped or cut off from others or the outside world. This could indicate feelings of being misunderstood or excluded. The choice of words like ""ruined"" and the overall tone of the passage hint at a sense of loss or disappointment, possibly related to political or social issues."

However, a commonly cited guideline is that one large plant or two to three smaller plants can improve air quality in a 100 square foot space.

Here are some steps to help you determine the appropriate number of plants for your closet office:

1. **Measure the Space**: Determine the square footage of your closet office. If it's smaller than 100 square feet, you may need fewer plants.

2. **Choose the Right Plants**: Some plants are better at purifying the air than others. Common air-purifying plants include:
   - **Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)**
   - **Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)**
   - **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)**
   - **Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica)**
   - **Boston Fern (Nephrolepis exaltata)**
   - **Areca Palm (Dypsis lutescens)**
   - **Dracaena (Dracaena spp.)**

3. **Consider the Lighting**: Ensure the plants will receive adequate light. Some plants require more light than others.

4. **Air Quality Concerns**: If you have specific air quality concerns (e.g., formaldehyde, benzene, or trichloroethylene), certain plants are more effective at removing these pollutants.

5. **Maintenance**: Consider how much time and effort you can dedicate to plant care. Some plants require more maintenance than others.

For a small closet office, you might start with one large plant or two to three smaller plants. If you have specific air quality concerns or a larger space, you may need more plants. 

For a more precise recommendation, you could use an online air quality calculator or consult with a local nursery or environmental expert."

While a low body fat percentage can be beneficial for certain athletes or individuals in specific professions (like bodybuilders or dancers), for most women, it can lead to various health issues. Here are some potential consequences:

1. **Hormonal Imbalance**: Low body fat can disrupt hormonal balance, particularly affecting estrogen levels. This can lead to irregular menstrual cycles, amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), and other reproductive issues.

2. **Metabolic Issues**: Low body fat can affect metabolism, potentially leading to decreased basal metabolic rate and difficulty maintaining energy levels.

3. **Bone Density**: Low body fat can contribute to lower bone density, increasing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.

4. **Immune Function**: Adequate body fat is necessary for proper immune function. Low body fat can weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections and illnesses.

5. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Low body fat can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, which are stored in fat tissues.

6. **Mental Health**: Low body fat can affect mood and mental health, potentially leading to increased stress, anxiety, and depression.

7. **Physical Performance**: While low body fat can be advantageous for certain athletic pursuits, it can also lead to decreased physical performance and endurance.

If a woman's body fat percentage is consistently below 16%, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider to assess overall health and address any underlying issues that may be contributing to the low body fat percentage. A balanced diet and regular exercise, tailored to individual needs, can help maintain a healthy body fat percentage."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
Articles 52 to 58 of the Treaty shall apply to the French overseas departments under the conditions laid down in this Decision.At the time when the directives implementing the General Programme for the Abolition of Restrictions on Freedom of Establishment are adopted, the Council may as an exception and to the extent necessary issue special directives on the establishment of persons and companies or firms in the French overseas departments. Without prejudice to the implementation of the measures adopted pursuant to the Treaty and to the Implementing Convention of 25 March 1957 and of those to be adopted pursuant to Article 1, the right of establishment in the French overseas departments shall be progressively extended to the companies or firms and nationals of Member States other than France, so that all discrimination may disappear not later than three years after the application of this Decision.The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall issue the necessary directives for the implementation of that progressive extension.However, the nationals and companies or firms of a Member State shall only be able to benefit, in respect of a given activity, in a French overseas department from the provisions of the first paragraph to the extent to which the State of which they are nationals grants in respect of the same activity advantages of the same kind to French nationals and companies or firms. The provisions of Article 106 of the Treaty, in so far as they are not affected by the Council Decision of 11 May 1960 on the application to Algeria and to the French overseas departments of the provisions of the Treaty concerning capital movements, shall apply to the French overseas departments. This Decision shall be applied by the Member States on the same date as the Council Decision on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Economic Community.That date shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

In fixing that yield, account shall be taken, in respect of each method of cultivation as referred to in paragraph 3, of the yields which are representative of the general trend revealed by sampling carried out by the producer Member States. The sampling shall be made, in respect of each of those methods of cultivation, on a representative percentage of the land under soya, having regard to the geographical distribution of such land.3. Each year after the harvest one or more homogeneous production areas shall be established for irrigated and for non-irrigated soya by reference to the factors which have influenced production conditions. The areas shall be established with particular reference to regions which are representative of the crop obtained from each of those methods of cultivation.4. Each year an indicative yield shall be fixed for each of the areas and methods of cultivation referred to in paragraph 3.'

20. What's is the sum of the squares of all factors of 210?","To find the sum of the squares of all factors of 210, we first need to determine its prime factorization and then use properties of divisors and their squares.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization
The prime factorization of 210 is:
\[ 210 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \]

### Step 2: List All Factors
The factors of 210 can be found by considering all combinations of its prime factors:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, 210 \]

### Step 3: Sum of Squares of Factors
To find the sum of the squares of all factors, we use the property that if \( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} \), then the sum of the squares of the divisors of \( n \) is given by:
\[ \sigma_2(n) = (1 + p_1^2 + p_1^4 + \cdots + p_1^{2e_1})(1 + p_2^2 + p_2^4 + \cdots + p_2^{2e_2}) \cdots (1 + p_k^2 + p_k^4 + \cdots + p_k^{2e_k}) \]

For \( n = 210 = 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 \), we have:
\[ \sigma_2(210) = (1 + 2^2)(1 + 3^2)(1 + 5^2)(1 + 7^2) \]

### Step 4: Calculate Each Term
Now, we calculate each term:
\[ 1 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 \]
\[ 1 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10 \]
\[ 1 + 5^2 = 1 + 25 = 26 \]
\[ 1 + 7^2"

| **Element**                | **Perfect Market**                                                                 | **Healthcare Market**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Perfect Information**    | All buyers and sellers have complete and accurate information.                     | Patients often lack information about their health conditions and treatment options.   |
| **Perfect Competition**    | Many small firms compete, and no single firm can influence prices.                 | A few large providers and insurers dominate the market.                              |
| **Homogeneous Products**   | All products are identical.                                                       | Healthcare services and treatments vary widely.                                       |
| **No Barriers to Entry**   | Low costs and no restrictions for new firms to enter the market.                   | High costs and regulatory barriers prevent new entrants.                             |
| **No Externalities**       | No external costs or benefits.                                                    | Moral hazard and adverse selection create externalities.                             |
| **No Government Intervention** | Minimal government regulation.                                                    | Extensive government regulation and intervention.                                    |
| **No Market Power**        | No single firm can control market prices.                                         | Providers and insurers have significant market power.                                |

However, there is no built-in `ParentName` property in Lua or Luau. To get the name of a parent, you would typically access the `Name` property of the parent object.

Here's an example:

```lua
local child = script.Parent -- Assume this is a child object

-- Get the parent of the child
local parent = child.Parent

-- Get the name of the parent
local parentName = parent.Name

print(parentName)
```

In this example, `parentName` will contain the name of the parent object.

If you want to access the `ParentName` in a more concise way, you can create a custom function or use a local variable to store the parent's name:

```lua
local child = script.Parent -- Assume this is a child object

-- Get the name of the parent
local parentName = child.Parent.Name

print(parentName)
```

This approach is more efficient and avoids the need to call `Parent` twice."

","Let's analyze the given statement and the conclusion:

Given: ""A man with a mustache and blue garment sitting on a sidewalk and playing a stringed instrument.""
Conclusion: ""A man with a creepy mustache is outside playing guitar.""

1. The mustache is described as ""creepy"" in the conclusion, but the original statement does not provide any information about the appearance being creepy.
2. The original statement mentions a ""stringed instrument,"" but does not specify that it is a guitar.

Based on these points, we cannot conclude that the man is playing a guitar or that his mustache is creepy.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set this up:

### 1. **Edit the Sudoers File**
   - The sudoers file is located at `/etc/sudoers`. You should always use the `visudo` command to edit this file to ensure that the syntax is correct and to avoid locking yourself out of the system.
   - Open the sudoers file with `visudo`:
     ```bash
     sudo visudo
     ```

### 2. **Add the Sudo Rule**
   - Add a line to the sudoers file to allow a user or group to run specific commands without a password. For example, to allow the user `john` to run the `apt-get update` command without a password, you would add:
     ```bash
     john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get update
     ```
   - To allow a group of users, you can specify the group name instead of the username:
     ```bash
     %sudoers ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get update
     ```
   - You can also allow a user to run all commands without a password:
     ```bash
     john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
     ```

### 3. **Save and Exit**
   - After adding the line, save the file and exit the editor. In `visudo`, you can use `Ctrl+X` followed by `Y` to save and exit.

### 4. **Test the Configuration**
   - To test if the configuration is correct, you can run the command as the user:
     ```bash
     sudo -u john apt-get update
     ```
   - If the configuration is correct, you should not be prompted for a password.

### 5. **Security Considerations**
   - **Be cautious**: Allowing users to run commands without a password can be a security risk. Ensure that the commands you allow are strictly controlled and necessary.
   - **Limit the scope**: Only allow the minimum necessary commands to be run without a password.
   - **Monitor usage**: Keep an eye on the sudo logs to monitor who is using the passwordless sudo privileges.

### 6. **Additional Options**
   - You can"

Write some codes about augmentation, then, classifies via keras with other models ensembled. Validation must be f1 macro.","Certainly! Below is a step-by-step guide to perform text augmentation, train a model using Keras, and ensemble multiple models for classification. We'll use the `transformers` library for text augmentation and `scikit-learn` for ensemble learning. We'll also use `keras` for building and training the models.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install transformers scikit-learn tensorflow
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
```

### Step 3: Load and Preprocess Data

```python
# Load the datasets
train_df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('test.csv')
submission_df = pd.read_csv('submission.csv')

# Encode labels
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
train_df['label'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(train_df['label'])

# Split the train data into train and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(train_df['text'], train_df['label'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 4: Text Augmentation

We'll use the `transformers` library to perform text augmentation.

```python
from transformers import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling

# Initialize the tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Tokenize the text
train_encodings = tokenizer(list(X_train), truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=128)
val_encodings = tokenizer(list(X_val), truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=128)
test_encodings = tokenizer(list(test_df['text']), truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=128)

# Convert to TensorFlow datasets

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy contracted by 20.4% in April, May, and June due to the coronavirus lockdown, performing worse than other major industrial nations, with Scotland experiencing a 19.4% decline."

The `=` symbol is not a special character in regular expressions, so you can use it directly without escaping it.

Here's an example:

```python
import re

pattern = r""some=example""
text = ""This is an example of some=example text.""

match = re.search(pattern, text)
if match:
    print(""Match found:"", match.group())
else:
    print(""No match found."")
```

In this example, the `=` in the pattern `some=example` is used as a literal character and does not need to be escaped.

However, if you want to match a literal backslash followed by an `=`, you would need to escape the backslash:

```python
pattern = r""\\=""
```

In this case, the backslash `\` is an escape character, so you need to escape it with another backslash to match a literal backslash.

So, to summarize:
- `=` does not need to be escaped.
- `\=` needs to be written as `\\=` to match a literal backslash followed by an `=`."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel highlighted that Donald Trump has broken a presidential record by playing golf more than 70 times during his first year in office. Kimmel uses this fact to critique Trump's lack of significant accomplishments, suggesting that while Trump spends a considerable amount of time on leisure activities, he has not achieved much in terms of policy or governance. Kimmel's statement implies that Trump's focus on golfing is a distraction from the expected responsibilities of the presidency, and he uses this as a basis to argue that Trump has not made substantial progress in his role."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating. 
 Answer: is fond of collecting family life photographs

The village is surrounded by lush green fields and rolling hills that stretch as far as the eye can see. The air is fresh and crisp, carrying the scent of wildflowers and freshly cut grass.

As I walk through the village, I am greeted by the warm and friendly faces of the locals. They wave and smile as I pass by, and I can't help but feel a sense of belonging and comfort in their presence. The village is home to a small church, a general store, and a few cozy cafes and restaurants that serve up delicious local cuisine.

One of the things that makes this village so special is its natural beauty. The rolling hills are dotted with wildflowers in the spring and summer, and the fields are covered in a blanket of snow in the winter. The village is also home to a small river that winds its way through the center, providing a peaceful and serene atmosphere.

But what truly makes this place special to me is the sense of community and connection that exists here. The villagers are always willing to lend a helping hand, and there is a strong sense of camaraderie and support that exists between them. Whether it's a community event or a simple conversation over coffee, there is always a sense of warmth and kindness that permeates the air.

As I walk through the village, I am struck by the beauty and simplicity of the place. It is a place where time seems to slow down, and the stresses of everyday life fade away. It is a place where I can escape the hustle and bustle of the city and find peace and tranquility. And for that, I am eternally grateful."

Below is a conceptual design for data exchange between two companies using Azure Storage Queues. This design will outline the architecture, components, and steps involved in setting up and using Azure Storage Queues for data exchange.

### Conceptual Design: Data Exchange Using Azure Storage Queues

#### Components:
1. **Azure Storage Account**: This will host the Storage Queues.
2. **Sender Company (Company A)**: The company that initiates the data exchange.
3. **Receiver Company (Company B)**: The company that receives the data.
4. **Azure Functions or Web API**: Optional, used for processing and handling the data.
5. **Azure Logic Apps**: Optional, used for orchestrating the data exchange process.

#### Architecture Overview:
1. **Data Producer (Company A)**: Sends data to an Azure Storage Queue.
2. **Data Consumer (Company B)**: Reads data from the Azure Storage Queue.
3. **Optional Processing Layer**: Processes the data before it is consumed by Company B.

### Detailed Steps:

     using Azure.Storage.Queues;
     using System.Text;

     public static async Task Run(string myQueueItem, ILogger log)
     {
         var connectionString = ""YourStorageConnectionString"";
         var queueName = ""data-exchange-queue"";

         var queueClient = new QueueClient(connectionString, queueName);

         var message = new QueueMessage(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(myQueueItem));
         await queueClient.SendMessageAsync(message);
     }
     ```

Sails are typically made of materials such as canvas, nylon, or polyester, which are visible and tangible. The force that propels a sailboat is not due to the sail being made of air, but rather the interaction between the wind (which is air in motion) and the sail. The wind pushes against the sail, causing the sailboat to move. 

If you meant to ask about why a sail can appear to be ""invisible"" at times, it could be due to the following reasons:

1. **Light Conditions**: In bright sunlight, the sail may blend into the background, making it hard to see.
2. **Color and Material**: Some sails are designed to be light-colored or reflective, which can make them less visible.
3. **Angle of View**: If the sail is at a certain angle relative to the observer, it might not reflect enough light to be easily seen.
4. **Distance**: At a great distance, the sail may appear smaller and less distinct, making it harder to see clearly.

If you have a different context or question in mind, please clarify, and I'll be happy to help further!"

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

   - Gather a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages, such as social media posts, customer reviews, news articles, and academic papers.
   - Clean and preprocess the data by removing noise, handling missing values, and normalizing text (e.g., lowercasing, removing punctuation, and stop words).
   - Perform entity recognition using advanced NLP techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify and categorize named entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations) in the text.

2. Feature Extraction:
   - Use advanced NLP techniques like Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition to extract meaningful features from the text.
   - Apply semantic analysis techniques such as Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) and Contextualized Word Embeddings (e.g., BERT, ELMo) to capture the meaning and context of words in the text.
   - Utilize sentiment-specific features like sentiment lexicons (e.g., AFINN, SentiWordNet) and emotion lexicons (e.g., EmoLex) to capture the emotional content of the text.

3. Model Selection and Training:
   - Experiment with various machine learning algorithms and deep learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa).
   - Train the models on the preprocessed and feature-extracted data, using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness and generalizability.
   - Fine-tune the models using techniques like transfer learning and multi-task learning to improve performance on specific domains or languages.

4. Evaluation and Optimization:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC).
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning and model selection to optimize the model's performance.
   - Use techniques like cross-validation and ensemble learning to improve the model's robustness and generalizability.

5. Deployment and Monitoring:
   - Deploy the model in a production environment, ensuring it can handle real-time data and scale to handle large volumes of text.

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string into a short, shareable string in JavaScript, you can use a combination of Base64 encoding and URL-safe encoding. Base64 encoding will convert the string into a format that can be safely used in URLs, and URL-safe encoding will further modify the output to ensure it doesn't contain characters that are not allowed in URLs.

Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. **Base64 Encode the String**: Convert the string to a Base64 encoded string.
2. **URL-Safe Encoding**: Modify the Base64 string to make it URL-safe by replacing certain characters.

Here's a complete example:

```javascript
function base64Encode(str) {
    return btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(str)));
}

function base64Decode(str) {
    return decodeURIComponent(escape(atob(str)));
}

function encodeStringForUrl(str) {
    // Base64 encode the string
    const base64Encoded = base64Encode(str);
    // URL-safe encoding: replace '+' with '-' and '/' with '_'
    const urlSafeEncoded = base64Encoded.replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_').replace(/=/g, '');
    return urlSafeEncoded;
}

function decodeStringFromUrl(encodedStr) {
    // Reverse the URL-safe encoding: replace '-' with '+' and '_' with '/'
    const urlSafeDecoded = encodedStr.replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/');
    // Base64 decode the string
    const base64Decoded = base64Decode(urlSafeDecoded);
    return decodeURIComponent(base64Decoded);
}

// Example usage
const originalString = ""This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";
const encodedString = encodeStringForUrl(originalString);
console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);

const decodedString = decodeStringFromUrl(encodedString);
console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Base64 Encoding**:
   - `btoa` converts a string to a Base64 encoded string.
   - `encodeURIComponent` ensures that the string is properly encoded for URL use.
   - `unescape` and `escape` are used to handle special characters.

2. **URL-Safe Encoding**:
   - Replace `+` with `-` and `/` with `_` to"

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node using a heuristic search algorithm, we can use the A* search algorithm. The A* algorithm uses a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal, and it is optimal if the heuristic is admissible (never overestimates the true cost to the goal).

For this problem, we can use the Manhattan distance as the heuristic function, which is admissible for this grid world. The Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by:

\[ h(x, y) = |x_2 - x_1| + |y_2 - y_1| \]

Given the start node (1,1) and the goal node (3,3), the heuristic values for each node can be calculated.

Let's apply the A* algorithm step by step:

1. **Initialize the open list** with the start node (1,1) and set its cost to 0.
2. **Initialize the closed list** as empty.
3. **While the open list is not empty:**
   - **Select the node with the lowest f-score (f = g + h) from the open list.**
   - **If the selected node is the goal node, reconstruct the path and return it.**
   - **Move the selected node to the closed list.**
   - **For each neighbor of the selected node:**
     - **If the neighbor is not in the closed list:**
       - **Calculate the tentative g-score (cost from start to neighbor).**
       - **If the neighbor is not in the open list, or the tentative g-score is less than the current g-score of the neighbor, update the neighbor's g-score and set its parent to the selected node.**
       - **Add the neighbor to the open list.**

Let's go through the steps:

1. **Start node (1,1):**
   - g = 0
   - h = |3-1| + |3-1| = 4
   - f = g + h = 0 + 4 = 4
   - Add (1,1) to the open list.

2. **Neighbors of (1,1):**

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz and achieve the ideal foam and bloom, follow these steps and tips:

### Ingredients:
- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz egg white
- 1 oz lemon juice
- 1 oz lime juice
- 1 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz orange flower water
- 1 oz heavy cream
- Soda water (e.g., Topo Chico)
- Ice cubes

### Equipment:
- Cocktail shaker
- Strainer
- Collins glass

### Instructions:

1. **Dry Shake:**
   - Add all ingredients except for the soda water to a cocktail shaker.
   - Shake vigorously for 2-3 minutes without adding ice. This helps to emulsify the egg white and cream, creating a smooth, frothy texture.

2. **Add Ice and Shake Again:**
   - Add a small amount of ice (about 3-4 small cubes) to the shaker.
   - Shake again until the mixture is well-chilled or until the ice has mostly melted. This helps to chill the drink without diluting it too much.

3. **Strain and Serve:**
   - Pour the soda water into a Collins glass.
   - Strain the cocktail over the soda water.
   - If done correctly, you should see a meringue-like foam rise to the top of the drink.

### Tips for Achieving the Ideal Foam and Bloom:

1. **Shake Vigorously:**
   - The key to a good Ramos Gin Fizz is the foam. Shake the mixture vigorously for at least 2-3 minutes during the dry shake. This ensures that the egg white and cream are well emulsified, creating a thick, frothy foam.

2. **Use Fresh Egg Whites:**
   - Fresh egg whites provide a better emulsifying agent and result in a smoother, more stable foam. If you're concerned about raw eggs, you can use pasteurized egg whites.

3. **Use the Right Ice:**
   - Use small ice cubes (about 3-4 small cubes) when you add them to the shaker during the second shake. This helps to chill the drink without diluting it too much.

4. **Use the Right Shaker:**
   - A good quality cocktail shaker with a tight-fitting lid is essential. This ensures that the mixture is shaken thoroughly without any leaks.

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross.

A group has the following properties: uid, name, thumbnail\_url, creation\_date
This API must be written in Python, using FastAPI and pydantic for DTO.
DTO names must end with ""DTO"".
I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","Certainly! Below is a basic implementation of a REST API using FastAPI and Pydantic to manage groups of users. The API will include endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting groups. The DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) are separated into read and write DTOs.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

First, make sure you have FastAPI and Pydantic installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

### Step 2: Define DTOs

We'll define two sets of DTOs: one for creating/updating groups (`GroupWriteDTO`) and one for reading groups (`GroupReadDTO`).

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class GroupWriteDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: str

class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: int
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: str
```

### Step 3: Define the Group Model

We'll define a simple in-memory model to store the groups. In a real-world application, you would likely use a database.

```python
groups = []
group_id_counter = 1
```

### Step 4: Define the API Endpoints

Now, let's define the API endpoints using FastAPI.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends
from typing import List, Optional
from datetime import datetime
from uuid import uuid4

app = FastAPI()

# Helper function to generate a unique ID
def generate_uid():
    return str(uuid4())

# Helper function to find a group by UID
def find_group_by_uid(uid: str):
    for group in groups:
        if group['uid'] == uid:
            return group
    return None

# Helper function to find a group by name
def find_group_by_name(name: str):
    for group in groups:
        if group['name'] == name:
            return group
    return None

# Create a new group
@app.post(""/groups/"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
def create_group(group: GroupWriteDTO):
    new_group = {
        ""uid"": generate_uid(),

These differences can be influenced by various factors such as climate, habitat, and availability of hosts. Here are some general observations:

1. **Climate and Seasonality**: In regions with distinct seasons, Tabanus species may have different flight patterns. For example, in temperate regions, they may be more active during the warmer months, while in tropical regions, they may be active year-round.

2. **Habitat**: The type of habitat can influence flight patterns. For instance, Tabanus species that live in open grasslands may have different flight patterns compared to those in forested areas. Open habitats may allow for more direct and expansive flight paths, while forested areas might result in more erratic and shorter flights.

3. **Host Availability**: The presence and distribution of hosts (such as horses, cattle, and other animals) can also affect flight patterns. Areas with a high density of hosts may see more frequent and concentrated flights by Tabanus species.

4. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Some Tabanus species have evolved specific behaviors to optimize their feeding and mating success. For example, some species may have developed flight patterns that allow them to efficiently locate hosts or avoid predators.

5. **Genetic Differences**: Over time, different populations of Tabanus in various regions may develop genetic differences that influence their flight patterns and other behaviors. These differences can be a result of natural selection pressures specific to each region.

While these are general observations, the specific flight patterns of Tabanus species can vary significantly depending on the local environment and ecological conditions. For detailed information on specific species and regions, consulting scientific literature or local entomological studies would be beneficial."

Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
