When you encounter a 404 error while running `docker-compose up`, it's usually not directly related to Docker or Docker Compose, but rather to the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Here are some common reasons and troubleshooting steps:

1. **Incorrect Service Names**:
   - Ensure that the service names in your `docker-compose.yml` file match the names you are trying to start with `docker-compose up`.

2. **Service Not Defined**:
   - Make sure that the service you are trying to start is defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. **Incorrect Configuration**:
   - Check the configuration of the service. For example, if you are trying to access a service, ensure that the service is correctly configured to expose the necessary ports and that the service is running.

4. **Network Issues**:
   - Ensure that the service is running and accessible within the Docker network. Docker Compose creates a default network for services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Make sure that the service is up and running and that the service name you are using is correct.

5. **Service Not Built**:
   - If you are using a custom Dockerfile, ensure that the service has been built successfully. You can use `docker-compose build` to build the service before running `docker-compose up`.

6. **Incorrect Command**:
   - Ensure that you are using the correct command. For example, `docker-compose up` starts all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, while `docker-compose up <service-name>` starts only the specified service.

7. **Logs**:
   - Check the logs of the service using `docker-compose logs <service-name>` to see if there are any errors or issues that might be causing the 404 error.

Here is an example of a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - ""5000:5000""
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
```

To start the services, you would run:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

If you are trying to access a specific service, you can use:"

The author's emotional state appears to be one of isolation, frustration, and possibly anger. The use of the metaphor of an ""inaccessible"" or ""impossible"" fortress suggests a sense of being trapped or cut off from others or from a better state of being. This could indicate feelings of powerlessness, alienation, or a sense of being overwhelmed by external forces. The choice of words like ""impossible"" and ""inaccessible"" further emphasizes the author's emotional state of being stuck or unable to connect with others or with a desired state of affairs."

However, a general guideline is that one small to medium-sized plant per 100 square feet (or about 9.3 square meters) can help improve air quality.

For a typical closet office, which is likely to be a smaller space, you might need just one or two plants. Some effective air-purifying plants for small spaces include:

1. **Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)**
2. **Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)**
3. **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)**
4. **English Ivy (Hedera helix)**
5. **Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica)**
6. **Aloe Vera (Aloe barbadensis)**

These plants are known for their ability to remove toxins like formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene from the air. If your closet office is particularly small, you might only need one plant, but for better air quality, consider having two or three.

Always ensure the plants are suitable for the lighting conditions in your closet office and that the space has proper ventilation to support the plants' health."

Below is a simple JavaScript program that allows users to draw on an HTML5 canvas. This example includes basic functionalities like drawing lines, rectangles, and clearing the canvas.

### HTML
First, create an HTML file with a canvas element and some buttons for drawing actions.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
    <meta charset=""UTF-8"">
    <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"">
    <title>Canvas Drawing</title>

    <button onclick=""drawRectangle()"">Draw Rectangle</button>
    <button onclick=""clearCanvas()"">Clear Canvas</button>
    <script src=""drawing.js""></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### JavaScript (drawing.js)
Next, create a JavaScript file (`drawing.js`) to handle the drawing logic.

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('drawingCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

let isDrawing = false;
let lastX = 0;
let lastY = 0;

// Function to start drawing
function startDrawing(event) {
    isDrawing = true;
    lastX = event.offsetX;
    lastY = event.offsetY;
}

// Function to draw line
function drawLine(event) {
    if (!isDrawing) return;
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.moveTo(lastX, lastY);
    ctx.lineTo(event.offsetX, event.offsetY);
    ctx.stroke();
    lastX = event.offsetX;
    lastY = event.offsetY;
}

// Function to draw rectangle
function drawRectangle() {
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.rect(50, 50, 200, 100);
    ctx.stroke();
}

// Function to clear the canvas
function clearCanvas() {
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
}

// Event listeners for mouse events
canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', startDrawing);
canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', drawLine);
canvas.addEventListener('mouseup', () => isDrawing = false);
canvas.addEventListener('mouseout', () => isDrawing = false);

Body fat serves several important functions in the body, including:

1. **Energy Storage**: Fat stores provide a reserve of energy that can be used when food intake is low.
2. **Thermal Insulation**: Fat helps to insulate the body and maintain body temperature.
3. **Organ Protection**: Fat cushions and protects vital organs.
4. **Hormone Production**: Fat cells produce hormones like estrogen, which are crucial for reproductive health.
5. **Metabolic Function**: Fat cells are involved in various metabolic processes.

A body fat percentage below 16% can lead to several health issues, including:

- **Menstrual Irregularities or Amenorrhea**: Low body fat can disrupt the hormonal balance necessary for regular menstrual cycles.
- **Decreased Libido**: Hormonal imbalances can lead to a reduced sex drive.
- **Bone Density Loss**: Fat cells are involved in the production of hormones that help maintain bone density.
- **Weakened Immune System**: Fat cells play a role in immune function.
- **Increased Risk of Osteoporosis**: Low body fat can lead to a higher risk of bone fractures.
- **Nutritional Deficiencies**: A very low body fat percentage can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients.

If a woman's body fat percentage is consistently below 16%, it is important to consult a healthcare provider to determine the underlying causes and to develop a plan to address any potential health issues. This may include dietary changes, increased caloric intake, and possibly medical intervention."

20. What's is the sum of the squares of all factors of 210?","To find the sum of the squares of all factors of 210, we first need to determine its prime factorization and then use properties of divisors and their squares.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization
The prime factorization of 210 is:
\[ 210 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \]

### Step 2: List All Factors
The factors of 210 can be found by considering all combinations of its prime factors:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, 210 \]

### Step 3: Sum of Squares of Factors
To find the sum of the squares of all factors, we use the property that if \( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} \), then the sum of the squares of the divisors of \( n \) is given by:
\[ \sigma_2(n) = (1 + p_1^2 + p_1^4 + \cdots + p_1^{2e_1})(1 + p_2^2 + p_2^4 + \cdots + p_2^{2e_2}) \cdots (1 + p_k^2 + p_k^4 + \cdots + p_k^{2e_k}) \]

For \( n = 210 = 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 \), we have:
\[ \sigma_2(210) = (1 + 2^2)(1 + 3^2)(1 + 5^2)(1 + 7^2) \]

### Step 4: Calculate Each Term
Now, we calculate each term:
\[ 1 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 \]
\[ 1 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10 \]
\[ 1 + 5^2 = 1 + 25 = 26 \]
\[ 1 + 7^2"

In this code:
- We define a slice of prime numbers `primes` containing three prime numbers larger than 1000.
- We initialize a variable `product` to 1.
- We use a `for` loop to iterate over the `primes` slice and multiply each prime number to the `product`.
- Finally, we use `fmt.Printf` to print the result, including a preposition (""of"") and a conjunction (""and"") in the output message.

When you run this code, it will output:

However, `v.ParentName` is not a valid syntax in Lua or Luau. If you want to store the name of the parent of `v` in a variable, you would do it like this:

```lua
local parentName = v.Parent.Name
```

This line of code assigns the `Name` property of `v.Parent` to the variable `parentName`.

If you want to use `v.ParentName` as a property or variable name, you would need to define it explicitly:

```lua
v.ParentName = v.Parent.Name
```

This would set `v.ParentName` to the name of `v.Parent`.

Here's a quick example:

```lua
local v = script.Parent
local parentName = v.Parent.Name
print(parentName)  -- This will print the name of the parent of v

v.ParentName = v.Parent.Name
print(v.ParentName)  -- This will print the name of the parent of v
```

This should help you understand how to use and access the `Parent` and `Name` properties in Lua and Luau."

Here's how you can do it:

### 1. **Edit the Sudoers File**
   - The sudoers file is located at `/etc/sudoers`. You should always use the `visudo` command to edit this file to ensure that the syntax is correct and to avoid locking yourself out of the system.
   - Open the sudoers file with `visudo`:
     ```sh
     sudo visudo
     ```

### 2. **Add a Rule for Passwordless Sudo**
   - You can add a rule to allow a specific user or group to run commands without a password. For example, to allow the user `username` to run all commands without a password, you would add the following line:
     ```sh
     username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
     ```
   - If you want to allow a group of users, you can specify the group instead of the username:
     ```sh
     %groupname ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
     ```

### 3. **Save and Exit**
   - After adding the rule, save the file and exit the editor. In `visudo`, you can use `Ctrl+X` followed by `Y` and `Enter` to save and exit.

### 4. **Verify the Configuration**
   - You can test the configuration by logging out and logging back in as the user or using `sudo -l` to list the privileges of the user:
     ```sh
     sudo -l
     ```

### 5. **Example Scenarios**
   - **Allow a specific user to run a specific command without a password:**
     ```sh
     username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/command
     ```
   - **Allow a specific user to run a specific command in a specific directory without a password:**
     ```sh
     username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/directory/*
     ```

### 6. **Security Considerations**
   - **Be cautious**: Allowing passwordless sudo can be a security risk, especially if the user has access to sensitive commands or directories. Ensure that the user or group you are granting this privilege to is trusted.
   - **Limit the scope**:"

Lastly, submission with ['id', 'label]. Label consists 0 to 7, and the text column consists of news article data. Write some codes about augmentation, then, classifies via keras with other models ensembled. Validation must be f1 macro.","Certainly! Below is a step-by-step guide to perform text augmentation, train a model using Keras, and ensemble multiple models for classification. We'll use the `transformers` library for text augmentation and `scikit-learn` for ensembling.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install transformers scikit-learn tensorflow
```

### Step 2: Import Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from transformers import DataCollatorWithPadding
import torch
import numpy as np
```

### Step 3: Load and Preprocess Data

```python
# Load datasets
train_df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('test.csv')
submission_df = pd.read_csv('submission.csv')

# Encode labels
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
train_df['label'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(train_df['label'])

# Tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Tokenize the text
def tokenize_data(df):
    return tokenizer(df['text'].tolist(), padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=512, return_tensors='pt')

train_encodings = tokenize_data(train_df)
test_encodings = tokenize_data(test_df)
```

### Step 4: Data Augmentation

We'll use the `transformers` library to perform data augmentation.

```python
from transformers import DataAugmenter

# Initialize the augmenter
augmenter = DataAugmenter()

# Apply augmentation
augmented_train_encodings = augmenter.augment(train_encodings, num_augmentations=5)
```

### Step 5: Train Multiple Models

We'll train multiple BERT models with different augmentations and ensemble them.

```python
def train_model(encodings, labels):
    model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=8)
    training_args = TrainingArguments(
        output_dir='./results',

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy contracted by 20.4% in April, May, and June due to the coronavirus lockdown, performing worse than other major industrial nations, with Scotland experiencing a 19.4% decline."

The `=` symbol is not a special character in regular expressions, so you can use it directly without escaping it.

For example:

```python
import re

pattern = r""=""
match = re.search(pattern, ""=example="")
print(match)  # <re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='='>
```

In this example, the `=` symbol is used as a literal character in the pattern, and it matches the `=` in the string.

However, if you want to match a literal backslash followed by an `=`, you would need to escape the backslash:

```python
import re

pattern = r""\\=""
match = re.search(pattern, ""\\=example="")
print(match)  # <re.Match object; span=(0, 2), match='\\='>
```

In this case, the backslash `\` is an escape character, so you need to escape it with another backslash to match the literal backslash.

In summary, you only need to escape the backslash `\` when you want to match a literal backslash, and you do not need to escape the `=` symbol itself."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel points out that Donald Trump has broken a presidential record by playing golf more than 70 times during his first year in office. Kimmel uses this fact to highlight his critique of Trump's accomplishments, suggesting that while Trump has spent significant time on leisure activities, he has not achieved much in terms of policy. Kimmel argues that it is unfair to say Trump hasn't accomplished anything and instead encourages people to sign up for the Affordable Care Act, which he says has several positive features, even if they don't support the president."

While each episode contributes to the overall theme of female friendship and empowerment, one episode that particularly stands out is ""The Best Man.""

In ""The Best Man,"" the episode showcases the friends' unwavering support for each other and their ability to stand up for what is right. The episode centers around one of the friends, who is being pressured by her fiancé to give up her career to focus on starting a family. Her friends rally around her, offering support, advice, and encouragement to pursue her dreams and not compromise her personal goals.

This episode effectively highlights the theme of female empowerment by demonstrating how the friends empower each other to make choices that are best for themselves, rather than conforming to societal expectations or external pressures. It also emphasizes the importance of having a strong support system of friends who will stand by you through thick and thin.

The episode's climax, where the friends collectively confront the fiancé and help their friend make a decision that aligns with her personal values and aspirations, is a powerful moment that underscores the strength and solidarity of female friendships."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating. 
 Answer: is fond of collecting family life photographs

The village is surrounded by lush green fields and rolling hills that stretch as far as the eye can see. The air is fresh and crisp, and the sun shines down on the rolling hills, casting a warm glow over the landscape.

As I walk through the village, I am greeted by the friendly faces of the locals. They wave and smile as I pass by, and I can't help but feel a sense of warmth and comfort in their presence. The village is filled with charming, old-fashioned buildings that have been lovingly restored and maintained over the years. The houses are painted in bright, cheerful colors, and the streets are lined with blooming flowers and lush greenery.

One of my favorite places in the village is the small, cozy bakery that sits on the main street. The smell of fresh bread and pastries wafts through the air, and the warm, inviting atmosphere makes me feel right at home. I love to sit at one of the small tables inside and enjoy a cup of steaming hot coffee while I read a book or catch up on the latest news.

But what truly makes this place special to me is the sense of community that exists here. The villagers are always willing to lend a helping hand, and there is a strong sense of camaraderie and friendship that binds them together. Whether it's a community event or a simple chat over the fence, the villagers always make me feel welcome and valued.

As the sun sets over the rolling hills, the village comes alive with the sound of laughter and music. The streets are filled with people enjoying the warm summer evenings, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers. It's a place where time seems to slow down, and I can't help but feel grateful for the simple pleasures of life.

This village is a place that fills my heart with joy and happiness. It's a place where I can escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life and find peace and contentment in the simple things. It's a place that reminds me of the beauty and goodness that exists in the world, and I am always grateful to have the opportunity to visit and experience it."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

The model should employ advanced natural language processing techniques, such as entity recognition and semantic analysis, to enhance its ability to detect subtle nuances in language and provide more accurate predictions. Additionally, the model should be trained on a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages to ensure its robustness and generalizability.","To develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately differentiate positive and negative emotions expressed in textual content, we can follow these steps:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
   - Gather a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages, such as social media posts, customer reviews, news articles, and academic papers.
   - Clean and preprocess the data by removing noise, handling missing values, and normalizing text (e.g., lowercasing, removing punctuation, and stop words).
   - Perform entity recognition using libraries like SpaCy or Stanford NLP to identify and categorize named entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations) and their relationships.

2. Feature Extraction:
   - Use advanced natural language processing techniques, such as word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT), to convert text into numerical representations.
   - Apply techniques like named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and sentiment lexicons to extract meaningful features from the text.
   - Utilize semantic analysis techniques, such as topic modeling (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Non-negative Matrix Factorization) and sentiment lexicons (e.g., AFINN, SentiWordNet) to capture the context and sentiment of the text.

3. Model Selection and Training:
   - Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, and gradient boosting, to find the best-performing model.
   - Use techniques like cross-validation, grid search, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
   - Train the model on a balanced dataset, ensuring that it can handle imbalanced classes and avoid overfitting.

4. Evaluation and Testing:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve.
   - Test the model on a separate test set to assess its generalizability and robustness.
   - Analyze the model's performance across different domains and languages to ensure its robustness and generalizability.

5. Deployment and Monitoring:

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string into a short, shareable string in JavaScript, you can use a combination of base64 encoding and URL-safe encoding. Base64 encoding will convert the string into a format that can be safely used in URLs, and URL-safe encoding will further modify the output to ensure it doesn't contain characters that are not allowed in URLs.

Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. **Base64 Encode the String**: Convert the string to a base64 encoded string.
2. **URL-Safe Encoding**: Replace certain characters in the base64 string to make it URL-safe.

### Step 1: Base64 Encoding

You can use the `btoa` function in JavaScript to perform base64 encoding.

### Step 2: URL-Safe Encoding

To make the base64 string URL-safe, you can replace the following characters:
- `+` with `-`
- `/` with `_`
- `=` with `~` (or remove them, depending on your needs)

Here's a complete example:

```javascript
function base64Encode(str) {
    return btoa(encodeURIComponent(str).replace(/%([0-9A-F]{2})/g, function(match, p1) {
        return String.fromCharCode('0x' + p1);
    }));
}

function base64Decode(str) {
    return decodeURIComponent(atob(str).split('').map(function(c) {
        return '%' + ('00' + c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16)).slice(-2);
    }).join(''));
}

// Example usage
const originalString = ""This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";
const encodedString = base64Encode(originalString);
console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);

const decodedString = base64Decode(encodedString);
console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base64 Encoding**:
   - `btoa` converts the string to a base64 encoded string.
   - `encodeURIComponent` is used to ensure that special characters are properly encoded.
   - The regular expression replaces `%` followed by two hexadecimal digits with the corresponding character.

2. **Base64 Decoding**:
   - `atob` decodes the base64 string.
   - `decodeURIComponent` converts the decoded string back to its original form."

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node using heuristic search, we can use the A* search algorithm. In this case, the heuristic function can be the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates between the current node and the goal node.

Here's the step-by-step process to find the optimal path:

1. Initialize the open list with the starting node (1,1).
2. Initialize the closed list as empty.
3. While the open list is not empty:
   a. Find the node with the lowest f-score (f = g + h, where g is the cost from the start node to the current node, and h is the heuristic estimate from the current node to the goal node).
   b. If the node is the goal node, reconstruct the path and return it.
   c. Move the node from the open list to the closed list.
   d. For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the tentative g-score (cost from start to neighbor through current node).
   e. If the neighbor is in the closed list and the tentative g-score is higher, skip it.
   f. If the neighbor is not in the open list or the tentative g-score is lower than the current g-score, update the g-score and set the current node as the parent of the neighbor, and add the neighbor to the open list.

Applying the A* search algorithm to the given grid:

1. Start at (1,1) with f-score = 0 + 4 = 4 (since h = |1-3| + |1-3| = 4).
2. Expand (1,1) and add its neighbors (0,1), (1,0), (1,2) to the open list with f-scores 5, 5, 5 respectively.
3. Expand (0,1) and add its neighbor (0,0) to the open list with f-score 6.
4. Expand (1,0) and add its neighbor (0,0) to the open list with f-score 6.
5. Expand (1,2) and add its neighbor (1,3) to the open list with f-score 5.
6. Expand (0,0) and add its neighbors (0,1), (1,0) to the open list (already in open list, skip).

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz and achieve the ideal foam and bloom, follow these steps and tips:

### Ingredients:
- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz egg white
- 1 oz lemon juice
- 1 oz lime juice
- 1 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz orange flower water
- 1 oz heavy cream
- Soda water (e.g., Topo Chico)
- Ice cubes

### Equipment:
- Cocktail shaker
- Collins glass

### Instructions:

1. **Dry Shake:**
   - Add the gin, egg white, lemon juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your cocktail shaker.
   - Shake vigorously without adding ice for about 2 minutes. This helps to emulsify the egg white and incorporate air into the mixture, which is crucial for creating the foam.

2. **Add Ice and Shake Again:**
   - Add a small amount of ice (about 3 small cubes) to the shaker.
   - Shake again until the mixture is well-chilled or until the ice has mostly melted. This helps to chill the drink and further incorporate the ingredients.

3. **Strain and Serve:**
   - Pour soda water into a Collins glass.
   - Strain the cocktail over the soda water.
   - If done correctly, you should see a meringue-like foam rise to the top of the drink.

### Tips for Achieving the Ideal Foam and Bloom:

1. **Shake Vigorously:**
   - The key to a good foam is vigorous shaking. The longer you shake, the more air you incorporate, which leads to a better foam. Some bartenders recommend shaking for as long as 35 minutes, but 2 minutes is a good starting point.

2. **Use Fresh Egg Whites:**
   - Fresh egg whites provide a better emulsification and a smoother texture. If you're concerned about raw eggs, you can use pasteurized egg whites or egg white powder.

3. **Use the Right Shaker:**
   - A good quality cocktail shaker with a tight-fitting lid is essential. This ensures that the mixture is well-emulsified and the foam is properly incorporated.

4. **Use Small Ice Cubes:**
   - Smaller ice cubes can help create smaller bubbles and a finer foam. This is because they melt more quickly and don't dilute the drink as much"

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.

Here are some general observations:

1. **Climate and Seasonality**: In regions with distinct seasons, Tabanus species may have different flight patterns. For example, in temperate regions, they might be more active during the warmer months, while in tropical regions, they could be active year-round.

2. **Habitat**: The flight patterns of Tabanus can vary based on the type of habitat. In areas with dense vegetation, they might be more likely to fly low to the ground and among vegetation. In open areas, they might fly higher and more erratically.

3. **Host Availability**: The presence and distribution of hosts (such as livestock, wildlife, and humans) can influence flight patterns. In areas with a high concentration of hosts, Tabanus may be more likely to fly in areas where hosts are more likely to be found.

4. **Migration Patterns**: Some species of Tabanus may exhibit migration patterns, moving to different regions based on the availability of hosts and suitable breeding sites. For example, some species may migrate to higher elevations during the summer months when hosts are more abundant.

5. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Different regions may have different adaptations in Tabanus species to cope with local conditions. For example, some species may have developed behaviors to avoid certain predators or to exploit specific host species.

It's important to note that while these differences exist, the specific flight patterns of Tabanus can vary significantly between species and even between populations within a species. For detailed information, it would be best to consult local entomological studies or research specific to the region of interest."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
