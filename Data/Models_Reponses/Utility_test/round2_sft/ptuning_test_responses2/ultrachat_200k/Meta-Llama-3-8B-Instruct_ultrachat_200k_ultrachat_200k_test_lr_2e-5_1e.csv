Answer according to: Palisades, NY - Frank Cheney Platt, advocate for poetry, poets, literature and writers, dedicated husband and father, died on February 26, in Rockleigh, NJ. Following its founding in 1985, he helped to build Poets House, now headquartered in Battery Park City, into a national poetry library and literary center with a 70,000-volume collection. Frank loved poetry that ""communicate[s] before it is understood"" (T.S. Eliot) and captures what is ""lost in translation."" (Robert Frost). In addition, he was committed to arts and culture as a means of protecting and cultivating principles of free speech and an open society.
He was born in New York City on November 6, 1932 and raised by his father Roger Platt, a teacher at St. Bernard's School, his mother Frances Cheney, and his grandfather Frank Cheney Jr. of Manchester, CT. Frank was educated at St. Bernard's, Dalton, Eaglebrook, Governor's Academy (formerly Governor Dummer), and Harvard College. He worked in publishing before becoming president of the Farfield Foundation, and later an assistant Dean for Columbia's School of the Arts.
In 2013, Frank was predeceased by his wife of 55 years Judy van der Gracht. She was the love of his life. His poignant dedication to her (including during her time with Alzheimer's) inspired respect and admiration from all who knew them. Frank was also passionate about his extended family - the Platts, Cheneys and, on Judy's side of the family, the Gilberts and van der Grachts as well as his dozen godchildren. His many longstanding and deeply-felt friendships were legion. Most involved a common love of music, poetry, literature and epicurean delights, not necessarily in that order.
Frank is survived by his three children Sophie Platt Pollok of Frankfurt, Germany, Arthur van der Gracht Platt of New York, NY and Roger Platt of Washington, DC and his grandchildren Esther Pollok, Lucas Pollok, Hilary Platt, and Benjamin Platt.

9ee0ff55c6c68056a8fbbbc0001c5f2661da99ded93138603160d6983fde4f94,"What is the proposed plan for launching and anchoring the ribbon, and how would mechanical lifters climb it to space?
Generate according to: A counterweight at the end of the space elevator will keep the carbon-nanotubes ribbon taut.
To better understand the concept of a space elevator, think of the game tetherball in which a rope is attached at one end to a pole and at the other to a ball. In this analogy, the rope is the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon, the pole is the Earth and the ball is the counterweight. Now, imagine the ball is placed in perpetual spin around the pole, so fast that it keeps the rope taut. This is the general idea of the space elevator. The counterweight spins around the Earth, keeping the cable straight and allowing the robotic lifters to ride up and down the ribbon.
Under the design proposed by LiftPort, the space elevator would be approximately 62,000 miles (100,000 km) high. LiftPort is one of several companies developing plans for a space elevator or components of it. Teams from across the world are set to compete for the $400,000 first prize in the Space Elevator Games at the X Prize Cup in October 2006 in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
The centerpiece of the elevator will be the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon that is just a few centimeters wide and nearly as thin as a piece of paper. Carbon nanotubes, discovered in 1991, are what make scientists believe that the space elevator could be built. According to Dr. Bradley Edwards of the Spaceward Foundation, ""Previously the material challenges were too great. But now we're getting close with the advances in creating carbon nanotubes and in building machines that can spin out the great lengths of material needed to create a ribbon that will stretch up into space"" [ref].
Under some early plans, leftover construction materials will be used to form the counterweight.
Carbon nanotubes have the potential to be 100 times stronger than steel and are as flexible as plastic. The strength of carbon nanotubes comes from their unique structure, which resembles soccer balls. Once scientists are able to make fibers from carbon nanotubes, it will be possible to create threads that will form the ribbon for the space elevator. Previously available materials were either too weak or inflexible to form the ribbon and would have been easily broken.
""They have very high elastic modulus and their tensile strength is really high, and that all points to a material that, in theory, should make a space elevator relatively easy to build,"" said Tom Nugent, research director, LiftPort Group.
Long carbon nanotubes -- several meters long or longer -- would be braided into a structure resembling a rope. As of 2005, the longest nanotubes are still only a few centimeters long.
Shorter nanotubes could be placed in a polymer matrix. Current polymers do not bind well to carbon nanotubes, which results in the matrix being pulled away from the nanotubes when placed under tension.
Once a long ribbon of nanotubes is created, it would be wound into a spool that would be launched into orbit. When the spacecraft carrying the spool reaches a certain altitude, perhaps Low Earth Orbit, it would begin unspooling, lowering the ribbon back to Earth. At the same time, the spool would continue moving to a higher altitude. When the ribbon is lowered into Earth's atmosphere, it would be caught and then lowered and anchored to a mobile platform in the ocean.
The ribbon would serve as the tracks of a sort of railroad into space. Mechanical lifters would then be used to climb the ribbon to space.
If built, the ribbon will represent a modern world wonder, and will be the tallest structure ever built. Consider that the world's tallest freestanding tower in 2005 is the CN Tower, which rises 1,815 feet 5 inches (553.34 meters) over Toronto, Canada. The space elevator would be 180,720 times taller than the CN Tower!
The 62,000-mile (100,000-km) long space elevator would rise far above the average orbiting height of the space shuttle (115-400 miles/185-643 km). In fact, it would equal nearly a fourth of the distance to the moon, which orbits the Earth at 237,674 miles (382,500 km).","1, the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the,,, and the the, and the, and the the the the the the the the the, and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the, and the, and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the, and the, and the, and the, and the, and the the the the the the the the, and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the"

Generate according to: Livpure, one of the well-known names in the water purifier category, has launched its new campaign around water conservation. Titled #CuttingPaani 2.0, the campaign is a quirky take on Mumbai’s popular concept of cutting chai. In an interview with exchange4media, Sushil Matey, Director, Marketing, Livpure spoke about the new campaign and how it could become the next mass movement.
Tell us about the rationale behind your new campaign #CuttingPaani2.0?
Livpure is in the B2C water business and we were keen to associate with something, which is in the larger interest of society and makes the brand come across as more holistic in nature. In India, a lot of drinking water is wasted since we do not finish our glass of water either in homes, offices, restaurants et al. Thus #CuttingPaani was conceived which is a quirky take on Mumbai’s famous concept of #CuttingChai.
Although there have been very powerful campaigns to spread awareness about water conservation, very few gave practical and doable solutions. #CuttingPaani 1.0 was a huge success in the digital and social media space because it was a doable idea and everybody could follow it. This success of #CuttingPaani 1.0 prompted us to launch the #CuttingPaani 2.0.
What were the consumer insights that Livpure accrued before getting both these campaigns out?
Our dipstick showed that Indians, in general, are very casual about wasting water. And, as we all know, it is a very scarce resource and possibly future wars would be fought for water. We waste water in a lot of ways- whether it is drinking water or water used during bathing or during brushing or shaving. We picked up #CuttingPaani since it was a catchy phrase, with it being a take on #CuttingChai. Knowing fully well that this would strike the necessary chord in making people realise that though the message is about saving drinking water it will sensitise them to the fact that we indeed waste a lot of water in other areas as well.
Why a digital film to tell the story of Shimla’s #AdoptCuttingPaani story?
In today’s time, the digital reach is high, sharp and targeting is better apart from the fact that we have the liberty of time to communicate the story, unlike an ATL medium. We are confident about the virality quotient of the campaign. In fact, a lot of newspapers in India have leveraged on our #CuttingPaani 1.0 campaign by asking readers to consume only as much as you need. Though, in a lighter vein, I must add that none of them have given us credit.
Can this campaign be converted into a mass movement?
We wish to own #CuttingPaani and take this idea further for sure and #CuttingPaani 2.0 is a step in that direction. We wish to take this further through BTL activations; social media campaigns and collaboration with large hotels/restaurants. To maintain awareness and memorability of the above, we have launched #CuttingPaaniTake on our Facebook page, which essentially gives two perspectives on topical situations.

“We are grateful for the FCC’s work on behalf of consumers to actively broker a productive path forward,” said Jeff Blum, DISH senior VP and deputy general counsel. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
Sinclair pulled its signals on Tuesday after a short extension expired and the two parties could not reach an agreement. Dish had claimed it had come to an agreement on pricing for Sinclair’s stations, but that the broadcaster was demanding the satellite giant negotiate carriage for an unnamed cable channel Sinclair hoped to own. Dish also had filed a complaint with the FCC, claiming Sinclair was not negotiating in good faith. As part of its new deal, Dish is asking the FCC to stay action on the complaint as its long-term agreement is being finalized.
The chairman also trumpeted the tentative agreement and the FCC&apos;s role in pressing for resolution. ""Today the most extensive retransmission blackout in history ended,"" he Tweeted, followed by: ""The FCC will remain vigilant. Use of the public airwaves is a public trust.""
""We are pleased to see that five million Dish subscribers are again able to access their local news and programming and most-watched network entertainment and live sporting events with the agreement reached this evening by Sinclair and Dish,"" said Rob Kenny of TVFreedom.org, a broadcaster-backed advocate for the retrans system. ""Local TV newscasts, severe weather updates and emergency alerts and warnings are important to viewers and something they value and rely on daily.""

It’s already been a year since Pope John Paul’s death. It seems only yesterday that we were out standing in Saint Peter’s Square, looking up at the familiar face in the window as he struggled to communicate with the expectant crowds below. Still fresh in our minds is the inundation of affection as the throngs poured into Rome to accompany this giant of the faith in his final hours, and to bid farewell to a dear friend.
#ad#John Paul is sorely missed. The crowds of pilgrims that have once more filled the streets of Rome to celebrate this anniversary testify to the impact he had on countless lives. More than a world leader, John Paul somehow managed to be a father and a friend to all. Even as a player on the world scene, he never lost his personal touch.
Many are now trying to reevaluate the legacy of this great pope, and as necessary as this endeavor is, a more personal reflection seems more in keeping with John Paul’s own style. I am sure that some of the things I most miss will resonate with many.
I miss, perhaps most of all, John Paul’s warmth and humanity. His quick wit and impish humor–like the vaudeville-style cane-twirling in Manila or his improvised raccoon-eyes to the delight of children–shattered notions of a dour Polish Christianity. His ability to focus on the person in front of him as if he or she were the only person in the world spoke volumes about the heart that beat in his breast. In an age when religion can be used as an excuse for violence and conflict, John Paul showed us that true faith in God is not only compatible with love for humanity, it galvanizes it. John Paul sincerely loved people–all people–and it was his Christian faith that enabled him to do so.
I miss his presence on the world scene. I remember him scolding mafia leaders in Sicily (which led to bombings of churches), fearlessly standing up to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, and defending human rights in his native Poland. He could be counted on to stand up for those most in need, to challenge world leaders to integrity, to preach Christ with an unaffected self-confidence that flowed from a deep-seated faith in God and a trust in the fundamental goodness of the human person. John Paul reached out perhaps more than any pope before him to a world in need, and provided moral authority and leadership when our generation needed it most.
I miss John Paul’s unflagging hope. His bright vision of the future and his characterization of the third millennium as a springtime of faith encouraged us to look beyond our real difficulties and to reach out for solutions. Far from a mere temperamental optimism, John Paul’s outlook was rooted in the firm belief that the battle is already won. Even from the midst of evil–John Paul wrote in his last book–God can and will continue to bring good. From his first “Be not afraid!” spoken on the day of his election in 1978 to his final witness of serene and hopeful suffering, John Paul taught us to abandon fear and to live with confidence in an infinitely good and merciful God.
I miss John Paul’s prayerfulness. Even in the midst of a grueling agenda of meetings, travels, and writings, the pontiff always made abundant time for prayer. Four hours a day was not unusual. What a challenge to those of us for whom prayer can seem at best like a luxury, or at worst like an underutilization of our precious time. Like Jesus before him, John Paul made prayer a priority and placed his trust more in God than in the best-laid programs of men and governments.
Incessant calls for John Paul’s sainthood, and the news of a probable miracle attributed to his intercession (poignantly, the cure of a French nun suffering from Parkinson’s disease) give grounds for hope that soon the Church will officially recognize what many already believe–that the man who so faithfully looked after humanity while on earth continues to do so from heaven.

Answer according to: West Ham United's Samir Nasri is unsure of what the future holds for him after his short-term contract with the Premier League team ends this season, the midfielder has said.
The Frenchman, who received a six-month doping ban in 2017 that was later extended to 18 months, returned to the pitch in January this year after signing a six-month contract with the London club.
""I don't know about my future,"" Nasri told the Evening Standard. ""I have seven games left and I just want to play free of injury and then we will sit down and see what is next.
""The most important thing for me was to come back, which I did in January.""
Nasri has two assists for West Ham in five games, including one in their comeback win over Huddersfield Town over the weekend.
The 31-year-old, who has played for Arsenal and won two league titles with Manchester City, missed four games with a calf injury earlier this year which he put down to a lack of games in the months prior to his return.
""I got an injury because I wasn't used to playing week in week out when I have been out of the game for so long. Now the manager takes his time with me,"" he said.

One of the long-standing concerns of Virginia’s legal community has been the handling of judicial appointments by the General Assembly.
Unlike many states that have elected judges, Virginia leaves all judicial appointments in the hands of state legislators. In theory, this arrangement removes judges from the influence of politics. In practice, judicial appointments have become tools of patronage.
In recent years, the Virginia Bar Association and other groups have complained about judicial vacancies and mounting case backlogs in many courts throughout the commonwealth.
In 2015, however, the appointment of a Virginia Supreme Court judge became a power struggle between Gov. Terry McAuliffe and the General Assembly’s Republican leadership.
The political maneuvering that has taken place to oust McAuliffe’s appointee has provoked calls for reform of the system.
Last summer McAuliffe named former Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Jane Marum Roush to the Supreme Court while the legislature was not in session.
Republicans cried foul, claiming they were not consulted on the interim appointment. They vowed to remove Roush from the court and name their own appointee.
Attempts to oust the justice from her seat, however, were thwarted when one moderate Republican state senator, John Watkins, and then his successor, Glen H. Sturtevant Jr., failed to follow along. Their dissent denied the Republicans the majority they needed in the Virginia Senate.
In early February, the tug-of-war over the justice took a surprising turn when state Sen. Louise Lucas, a Democrat from Portsmouth, briefly agreed to join the Republicans in replacing Roush. According to news accounts, Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr., a Republican from James City County, had proposed putting Portsmouth Circuit Court Judge Kenneth R. Melvin, a former legislator and Lucas’ mentor, on the state Court of Appeals.
Lucas, however, quickly changed her stance after meeting with McAuliffe and state Sen. Donald McEachin, head of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
Twenty-seven former presidents of the Virginia Bar Association released a statement urging McAuliffe and the Republican legislative leadership to resolve their quarrel.

cbaf21d8a20bd4bea915b5c3139e6693ab2b8aa8764b8b885ec71557326285c4,"Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How have labour shortages affected various sectors in the Visegrad countries and what risks does this pose to their economies?

Passage: People's migration fears have been an easy one to exploit for electoral opportunism by many politicians in Europe.
Particularly in the Visegrad states of Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, it has either brought nationalist anti-immigration parties into power or helped consolidate their grip on it.
Yet, much more attention ought to be given in those countries to how much migrants are needed for their booming economies' labour markets.
This has been a result of consequent high economic GDP growth of 3-4 percent in the past five years, compared to the EU's average of two percent growth.
In 2017, these were 4.8 percent (Poland, PL); 4.3 percent (Czechia, CZ); 4.1 percent (Hungary, HU) and 3.2 percent (Slovakia, SK) respectively.
In parallel, unemployment dropped heavily to 4.9 percent (PL); 2.9 percent (CZ); 4.2 percent (HU) and 8.1 percent (SK) by 2017.
Latest European Commission forecasts show these will continue decreasing sharply to 2.9 percent (PL); 2.5 percent (CZ); 3.3 percent (HU) and 6.3 percent next year, well below the five percent normal unemployment rate.
As good as that might sound, a side-effect has been that many vacancies remained unfulfilled.
The amount of open vacancies has more than quadrupled in the past five years. Especially in Czechia and Poland this is causing serious problems, despite the latter's profiting from Ukrainian migrants.
The commission's Spring and Autumn forecasts highlight these risks, which could undermine long-term growth, or even overheat the economy in the case of Czechia.
For Poland, despite the Ukrainian influx, there are doubts whether they can continue filling some of these shortages.
Business surveys confirm labour shortages limit production, building activity and business.
In industry, 43.7 percent (CZ); 83.3 percent (HU); 49.9 percent (PL); and 34.9 percent (SK) of surveyed companies state this is a problem.
For the construction sector, 37.8 percent (CZ); 64.4 percent (HU); 49.0 percent (PL) and 30.3 percent (SK) do.
Moreover, in services 17.3 percent (CZ); 38.3 percent (HU); 28.9 percent (PL) and 18.6 percent (SK) attest.
The labour shortages have also led to wages rising much faster than the rise in productivity.
In Slovakia and Hungary, Volkswagen and Kia for instance were forced to significantly increase wages because of strikes. Generally, labour costs are spiking in the Visegrad states.
While benefitting workers in the short-term, the economy could suffer in the long-term, as they undermine their low-wage economic models. It also jeopardises essential foreign investment that has helped drive growth.
In addition, the V4 is set to suffer as well from its demographic situation. Emigration and low fertility rates remain serious problems, dating back to their economic shock-therapy transitions where many struggled and had no jobs.
Due to this, populations remained stagnant since 1990.
The 2004 EU accession, particularly, caused many to emigrate abroad in search of (better paid) work abroad: circa three million people (registered) left the V4 between 2004 and 2016.
While profiting from remittances, this caused brain drain and the outflow of high-skilled labour. In turn, it also undermined welfare spending and made government budgets less growth friendly.
Demographics could constrain economic growth and governmental budgets again in the future.
Baseline projections for 2020 up to 2060 show the Visegrad Four's population could decrease by another 6.5 million people. In addition, the dependency ratio is set to increase sharply as well.
The dire demographic situation and labour shortages imply action is needed. Tight labour markets have already limited economic expansion in different sectors.
While in Poland Ukrainian labour prevented worse labour shortages, it is unclear how many more will come or stay. This means for Poland, as well as for the others that additional migrants from elsewhere will be needed.
More could be done as well to promote people having children and attract former emigrants. It should also make sure to keep current migrants, especially Ukrainians in the case of Poland.
Current hostile rhetoric on migration could backfire economically as many more migrants are needed to fill labour shortages and keep economies running smoothly.
This also requires honest debates in which the pros and cons of migration are discussed, as well as the Visegrad's overall demographic problems, since dependency ratios will continue to increase.
Therefore, rather than focusing on the imagined threat of migration and exploiting fears for electoral opportunism, the Visegrad's politicians would be wise to focus on the actual threat of how the lack of migrants could undermine their economic models, and with it their future prosperity and welfare.
Moreover, while migration has been a successful strategy to win elections in the short term, it could backfire in the long term.
The V4 countries have become one of the most vocal and recognised groups within the EU. But 2017 has seen a shake-up in the informal eastern and central European power bloc.","The, the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the, and the, and the, and the, and the the the the the the the the the the, and the, and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the"

Audi cars have been featured in many movies over the years. Did you spot one in these films?
Thought by many to be the most successful movie franchises ever to be created, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has different movies for everyone. There have been 21 films released already — the most recent being Captain Marvel — and at least a dozen more in the pipeline.
You don’t only enjoy the action in these films, but you may also be able to spot a stylish Audi, too.
When it comes to the Iron Man trilogy, at least one Audi has been featured in every film! A 2007 R8 and S5 B8 can be found in the first movie, a 2009 A8 LD3 and 2010 R8 Spyder are spotted in the sequel, and a 2012 S7 and R8 e-tron are both featured in Iron Man 3. The R8 e-tron also turned up at a VIP screening of Iron Man 3 at London’s Leicester Square a few days before the movie’s general release.
Another Audi fact is that there were almost as many Audi cars in the three Iron Man movies as there was in one Captain America film (Civil War). Within its two hours and 27 minutes runtime, you can see the 2017 Audi R8 V10 Plus, the 2017 SQ7, the 2017 A4, the 2016 A7 Sportback and even the Audi prologue concept car — a vehicle hailed as a “signature car” for Audi by Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Board Member for Development at Audi.
There’s more than meets the eye, though. Be on the lookout for an Audi R8, A6 Hybrid and A3 as you watch the excitement unfold in Avengers: Age of Ultron, as well as an Audi TTS Roadster, R8 Spyder, Q7 and A8 during Spider-Man Homecoming — the first standalone film by our favorite web-slinger since he became involved in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Taking a step back from the Marvel Universe, the German brand is also spotted in other film adaptations of comic book heroes. An R8 Spyder feature in Wolverine — the titular protagonist’s actor Hugh Jackman even turned up at the London Leicester Square premiere of the film in the same car — and an A8 plays a role in the 2015 big screen edition of Fantastic Four.
You also might’ve noticed the German manufacturer’s presence in all three film adaptations of E.L. James’ novels, which follow the relationship of business magnate Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.
What made this brand of car most attractive to the directors of this film? The brand’s multiple appearances came as a result of a partnership that was set up between Audi and Universal Pictures — a deal that Audi no doubt has relished seeing as the movie series has grossed over $1 billion across the globe!
In the first film of the trilogy, movie fans will be able to spot an Audi S8 D4, a 2017 S7 and an R8 Spyder. In the sequel, Fifty Shades Darker, a set of Audi Q7 cars and an A3 took center stage, with both the R8 and Q7 returning when the franchise wrapped up last year with Fifty Shades Freed.
To talk about Audi’s feature in Mission Impossible, let’s rewind back to the year 2000 and Mission: Impossible 2 to showcase how Audi has been featured in the hit movie series that has always starred Tom Cruise in the lead role of Ethan Hunt.
In a thrilling part of the film, Hunt leads a mission to destroy a deadly biological weapon and finds himself in an exhilarating car chase with international thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall. Hunt is behind the wheel of a Porsche Boxster and Nordoff-Hall tries to hold him off while driving an Audi TT — suffice to say that the pursuit between the two German-made cars into oncoming traffic is filled with nail-biting and edge-of-your-seat drama!
We couldn’t create an article about movies and cars without mentioning the Fast and Furious franchise. After all, this is a series that features street racing, heists, and espionage using all manners of vehicles, and has so far spanned eight main series entries and two additional short films — grossing in excess of $5 billion to date.
Fans are continually impressed with films that come out as part of this movie set. In fact, a spin-off movie called Hobbs & Shaw is due for release this summer.
Bringing a focus to Furious 7 now — a movie that clutched at the heartstrings as it was the final one to feature an appearance by series regular Paul Walker due to the actor being killed while the movie was still being filmed — is where you can see Audi appearing in the franchise.
You can spot the Audi R8 when it competes in an exciting quarter-mile race against a classic Plymouth Barracuda in the early moments of the film.
In the previously discussed films, the Audi’s that were featured are all models that exist. With I, ROBOT though, we’re taken to the future to see what Audi cars may potentially look like in years to come. Called the Audi RSQ, this concept vehicle represented the first time Audi had ever develop a car that was to be specifically used in a major Hollywood motion picture.
This futuristic model boasted piloted driving which allowed Will Smith’s Chicago police detective character Del Spooner to press a button to enable the car to take control of the driving — no doubt an early vision of the autonomous driving concept that we are only just starting to see being trialed in real life.
Those who take a ride in the RSQ are able to ride sideways and diagonal, while the use of balls instead of wheels was a quirky design touch. However, the typical single-frame grille and the presence of those four instantly recognizable silver rings let viewers clearly know that this car was without question an Audi.

Passage: Molly Ivins was the most popular liberal commentator of the last 25 years. Bill Minutaglio, author of a new biography of the tangy Texan, on why her voice is needed now more than ever.
There was Morley Safer, in a scrum of old hardball Texas liberals and graying hippies, and hanging out at his late friend Molly Ivins's favorite bar in Austin. With pitchers of Shiner everywhere, Safer was engulfed by dozens of folks wondering what the hell the woman who once had millions of faithful readers would say about health care, Afghanistan, and, yes, Rush Limbaugh’s attempt to own a piece of the Texas Blood Sport, otherwise known as professional football.
Safer, in town to donate his papers to the University of Texas, decided to drop by the book launch for my new biography of the ferociously mercurial and troubled Ivins.
Amid the weathered longhairs, musicians, underground cartoonists and civil liberties lawyers who once formed Austin's counterculture—the people Ivins called “freedom fighters”—Safer seemed merrily caught up in the nostalgia.
""She was one of the funniest and (most) thoughtful women I've ever met,"" Safer told a reporter from The Daily Texan. ""She was a great reporter, and we were good friends.""
Close to three years after her death, he's not alone in missing Ivins.
Nose around the Internet and you'll find plenty of other people still wishing she was writing—and wondering what Ivins, if she hadn't succumbed almost three years ago to cancer and a lifetime of wild personal rides, would have to say about the discourse in the twilight of 2009.
They miss the Texas cornpone flavored with a Tabasco sting, the unabashed defrocking she subjected the potentates to when they stole the stage. Maybe we need Molly—frequently described as “the only woman in the room”—more than ever before.
Her domineering father was the president of Tenneco and pals with men like Sen. John Tower, she grew up with George W. Bush, she was engaged to the son of a diplomat who did the CIA’s bidding. But after years of going to war with her controlling old man, devouring seditious issues of the muckraking Texas Observer, and furtively meeting the bravest Texas progressives, she eventually decided to raise a middle finger to all of her gilded upbringing.
It took a few years and some intense trip wires—the violent death of that fiance, her love affair with a ballsy activist, her knocking Bush's gun-toting political godfather to his knees one night in a Texas bar, her telling her bosses at The New York Times to shove it—but she finally found her calling as the most popular liberal political commentator in the last 25 years.
The fact that she did it in the Lone Star State, amid the misogynistic and Jack Daniels-fueled kingmakers, was rather startling to say the least. She fought sexual gropings by famous drunk politicos, three bouts of cancer, her own rampaging alcoholism—and plenty of death threats.
Through it all, Ivins kept the home fires burning for wandering progressives, liberal Israelites, who felt marginalized since the dawn of The Age of Reagan.
So, what would Molly Ivins say to those millions of readers today, including the ones beginning to think there has been some bait-and-switch at work with Obama?
Divorced from how you feel about her politics, most students of her work knew that she had perfected a magic act when it came to that public discourse; she talked about politics without the dour aura of either Emma Goldman or Charles Krauthammer. Nor did she scream with the raging acidity of Bill O’Reilly and Glenn Beck and their counterparts on the left. She chortled that Dubya was affable but a policy buffoon; she actually liked him personally, but hated his politics. And she spent years, and made a mint, working Bush over like his political career was one big speed bag. It was, as she sometimes told me and other folks in Austin, almost too easy.
Today, it might be a bit harder. She liked Obama and she thought he was far smarter than Bush. She’d maybe have to tap the piñata a bit more lightly in order to say what she wanted to say about Obama, about any sense of failed promises. But she would do it, and do it her way.
She would do it because she didn’t believe that a democracy was served very well by the vitriol, by the poison, by the hatred snaking through the discourse.
Bill Minutaglio is co-author, with W. Michael Smith, of Molly Ivins: A Rebel Life, released this week by PublicAffairs. He is a professor of journalism at The University of Texas at Austin and the author of several books, including George W. Bush & The Bush Family Dynasty and The President’s Counselor: The Rise to Power of Alberto Gonzales.","1, and the, and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the, and the, and the, and the, and the, and the the the the the the the the, and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the, and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the"

I had a family and other love ones.
How about you where do you stand?
When my heart still dies in front.
You killed the old beast in my gloom.
Fell us in love like a feather.
We stumbl’d upon each other.
Which witty poem did you inspire in me, what sincere praise did you give my words when I thought enough of you send a poem your wayWhich line did you write with my spirit surrounding you?
Why do I say I love you.?  Were you sincere when you said amen to the wisdom that I shared, were you one of those who thought your mocking, was more valuable than complianceI have lived with the resentments of scoffers.
The message for the masses is hope...so, I live  for the poems you send my wayFor, I grow strong in our relationship sailed by the winds of your encouragement, to my poets, my true friends; I truly know who you are, don't ever think I don’t!
Who Would Want To Be This Cold?
They said you needed surgery.
I drove you to the funeral home.
The arrangements were for you.
I had to wait outside that day.
I couldn't go in there.
I don't know how you made those plans.
You showed how much you cared.
You knew you wouldn't make it.
You feared the end was near.
I hate what your life did to you.
I wish you were still here.
How do you plan your funeral?
Were you as scared as I?
What were your thoughts heading to the docs?
Did you know that you would die?
I miss you more and more everyday, That's why I drink so much to take this   pain awayThe pain don't really go away it comes back, and I get so lost I don't know how to actI get lost in my thoughts of you, It kills me you can't come back ever no matter what I do, This is the hardest thing I ever had to go threwSome people say time will heal, but I know I'll be missing you still, It feels like I'm living in a bad nightmare I wish it wasn't realIf I could go back in time, I would go back and press rewindI would go to that day the 2nd of July, and make sure you were okay and you didn't dieAll I got got now are our memories and the tears I cry, To keep it together it's hard but believe me I try.
That your 'i love you' wasn't you lying""
yet all I feel is an emptiness inside..
Why did you have to leave?
Why does this have to hurt?
Cancer robbed thy life from thee..
But you went to heaven, and you went away.
That we'd die together in forevers sleep.
You didn't even say goodbye as you left me here.
I'm failing to choke down all these tears.
My face becomes moist, my sight turns to mist.
With my frown turned lips, i give you a kiss.
I try to look away as they lower your casket.
I'll try to survive, but I don't think i can las it.
I throw your favorite flowers into your grave.
Watching people throw dirt, over you they pave.
I feel no solace, I'm all alone.
As I see your name set in stone.
I feel a breeze, it's a wind so cold.
I remember the final words you had told..
You said to me, ""Don't take your life.""
I asked you, ""Why?"", as I put down the knife.
You told me you loved me, as its your final wish.
I shook my head yes, though I feel no bliss.
Why god took you away from me, but i will live on.
I hear your comforting whispers, I think its a sign.
So I know I'll see you agian when its my time.
The skeletal remains are being chalked out,while mystery and intrigue are engraven, cryptic.Lying beneath, this freshly seeded idea;upon these grounds, the words are etched,what are you looking for and how will you get it,for these are but the bare bones of a story.The key alone is in your closet, slowly turning,as you opened the creaking rusted door.You slowly peep inside the mausoleum of your mind,where cobwebs hang on every angle.Suddenly, a cold swift draft blows across your spine,as if someone has just, walked on your grave. You look up to see, all the entrapping’s laidbut then again, you are still lying in a good plot.
I’m going home to Jesus where He waits for me.
Spread your colored petals and cradle tender showers.
Ought we not to know the Tender of such lovely garden groves?
To cut away the stems of old for fuller future years.
Looking daily to their needs; so faithfully He waters.
When the Gardener comes to claim each one the earth held as its own.
He gently picks it at its peak and for His pleasure takes it home.
As God did one glorious morning, when the Perfect Rose had bloomed.
He rolled away the stone and met with Mary at the tomb.
There the sweetest Rose of Sharon rose that we die not alone.
But be gathered for a garden grove, surrounding heaven's throne.
I pray you will find.
and a peace of mind.
with God, you shall prevail.
you will never, never fail.
If not for people like YOU!

If you managed to generate very good ideas, conducted a thorough research, and organized your paper logically, but have made several grammar or spelling mistakes, your grade would be lowered. Revising and editing academic paper should be done several days prior to submission. Why? Because you need to leave your writing aside and then look at it with the fresh eye. Term paper editing is not about looking through your writing while listening to music, you need to be very attention and stay focused on numerous details.
First, take a look at your essay outline. Go through all points and try to change the order of ideas: make sure you have created a logical structure and ideas are presented either chronologically or thematically (from the least important to the most important). Locate thesis statement. Is it clear? Are there topic sentences in each paragraph? Are they related to the thesis statement? Are connections between the paragraphs clear or do you jump from one idea to another?
Essay body should contain enough supporting details contributing to thesis statement development. For example, if your topic is legalization of marijuana, you need to find at least three arguments supporting your point of view and provide rebuttal to the opposing views. Introduction and conclusion should not contain new information: introduction should provide general background information on the topic and inform the reader about your main idea, while conclusion should round up the whole essay.
Pay attention to each paragraph: it should include topic sentence and cover one point of discussion. Make sure you do not repeat the same idea twice in different parts of essay. Repeating is a sign of poor organization. Check the grammar - ask your parents or friends to assist you with essay editing . Pay attention to correct punctuation, avoid too short or too long sentences.
Revising is not the same as editing. Essay editing is about correcting mistakes, while essay revising is making major changes in your writing, adding ideas and deleting material. Revising should lead to overall paper improvement. Read your essay and if you do not like it, revise it. Ask yourself the following questions: what do I need to prove? What is the main idea? Is there enough supporting evidence? Are arguments clear and logical? Is my essay easy to understand? Have I cited all sources? Is introduction attention getting? Is conclusion logical?

Generate according to: On Friday, June 5, 2009, a formal ceremony marked not only a day to honor newly inaugurated Berkeley College President Dario A. Cortes, PhD, but also a time for the College to look ahead, as its new leader announced major restructuring initiatives. In the new Strategic Plan, Vision for the Future, 2010-2015, Dr. Cortes calls for Berkeley College to be comprised of five components: a School of Business; a School of Liberal Arts; a School of Professional Studies; a School of Continuing Education; and a School of Graduate Studies.
“These changes in the organizational structure of Berkeley College allow for greater opportunities for students as well as for the College. This will bring higher education and preparedness for success to more citizens in the business marketplace of today and tomorrow,” commented Dr. Cortes, who has been successful with restructuring initiatives at other colleges.
In his remarks, Dr. Cortes said that in order for the Strategic Plan to be successful, certain characteristics are vital: creativity and agility; globalization; entrepreneurial spirit; and the desire to harness technology to advance teaching, learning and administrative operations. Berkeley College will continue to build upon its solid foundation by harnessing these attributes, he added.
A leader in business education for 78 years, Berkeley College maintains an enrollment of over 7,200 students, with more than 700 international students in its Baccalaureate and Associate degree programs. The College has four New Jersey campuses located in Woodland Park (formerly West Paterson), Paramus, Woodbridge, and Newark; two New York campuses in Midtown Manhattan and White Plains; and an Extension Center in Lower Manhattan in the Wall Street area. In addition, the College offers Berkeley College Online and its Corporate Learning Partnership program. All campuses are accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The College’s website address is www.BerkeleyCollege.edu.

This is a very famous and liked by one and all. It is made with khoya, but now a days many instant mixes available in the market. With the instant mix, making it is very easy, but the taste differs from the one made with khoya. Once we taste the jamun made with khoya, we won't like to have them with the ready mix. I made them with khoya this time. All of us in my family liked very much. This I made as my kids' Birthday special. I have learned it from my neighbouring friend Geetha, who makes them only with khoya. Some people add rose water also. Khoya can be made at home or we can get it from stores also. But make sure that it should be fresh and a bit tighter and harder. Add a little all purpose flour to it and make jamuns. The shop keeper who sold khoya to me revealed the trick of the trade, that they add milk powder also to it, to make more softer and tastier jamuns. So we added that also in it. Combine water, sugar and cardamom, mix till the sugar dissolves. Bring it to boil. Boil it for 8 to 10 mins. Make a thin syrup. Sugar particles should not stick to the vessel, this will the syrup crystallizes, once it cooled. Add cardamom, I added the seeds directly, not the powder of it. Combine khoya, all purpose flour and milk powder together. Mix well and make soft dough out of it. Do not knead. Make small and equal sized balls. While making them press gently between palms and make round shaped balls. Heat oil in a deep and thick bottomed kadai. Do not over heat. Simmer the stove and slowly drop each ball into it. Cook them in a low to medium flame, stirring occasionally. If we cook them on high flame, they turn into brown outside and won't cook inside. Cook them till they turn brown in color. They should get nice golden brown color. Remove them from heat and slowly immerse them in sugar syrup. Let the sugar syrup be warm, even if it cooled, warm it for 2 minutes. Keep them in the syrup till we serve. Serve sweet and soft gulab jamuns cold or hot, either way is tasty. I like spongy sweets such as Rasgulla, Gulab gamun, and cham cham. The sugary juice with essence of makes the sweet even tastier.

Jason Nisbit, 39, is facing a charge of second degree homicide with intent in the death of 26-year-old Chelsea Martinez. A friend said Martinez’s husband found she'd been on a social networking site and had an exchange of disturbing messages with a man in Minnesota. Investigators tracked the profile to Nisbit. In the messages, Martinez said she can't wait to die but expresses fear over the idea. The two discuss how Nisbit will do it. Martinez said she will finally be at peace and thanks him. Martinez's car and body were found near a Minnesota park last week. Police say Nisbit admitted to killing her and took them to the body. Nisbit told police the two met at the park then walked a ways to a wooded area, saying he ""knew there was water available if he needed to wash anything off."" In the complaint, Nisbit said he tied Martinez's hands and feet with a cord then strangled her with another cord. After she passed out, he says he cut her throat with a knife. The complaint goes on to say he dragged her body to a culvert and partially covered her with dirt. Family and friends said the young mother of three battled depression and other mental issues her whole life and had been suicidal in the past. Minnesota authorities said Nisbit has no criminal record, only a few minor traffic offenses. He will be back in court August 24. Bond was set at $1 million. What was the evidence that led investigators to track Jason Nisbit in connection to the disappearance and death of Chelsea Martinez?","1.............................................., and the, and and and and and the, and and the the the the the the the the the, and and and the, and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the, and the, the, and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the, the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the, and the, and the, and the, and the,, and the the, and the, and the the the the the the the the the the, and the the the the, and the the the the the the the the the the, and the, and the, and the, and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the, and and the the the the the the the the the and and and and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the, and the, and the, and the, and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the"

This talk will elaborate on the lesser-known work of Edith Heath, situate her practice within a historical context, and critique traditional narratives of mid-century ceramic history.

University spokesman Mark Hebert said the school began Schlachter’s “termination process” late last week.
Schlachter has been employed at the school since 2008, Hebert said.

When you want something sweet, it’s hard to resist the classic chocolate chip cookie. It’s sweet. It’s comforting. It’s loyal. It’s basically your BFF.
But, for those times you don’t want your BFF to be loaded with refined sugar, simple carbs, and unhealthy fats, you’re in luck because I gave your BFF a make-over! It’s pretty much the chocolate chip cookie of your dreams. These deep dish cookies are full of protein, low in fat, grain free, and low in sugar. No joke! A typical chocolate chip cookie has about 13 grams of sugar and 2 grams of protein. Howevah, these delicious treats have a whopping 8 grams of protein and a measly 2 grams of refined sugar!
And because I am with everything else in life, I am also indecisive about wanting a super chewy cookie or a really crispy one. So, if you needed another reason to love these deep dish cookies, you get the best of both worlds with them! They have a nice, crispy edge with a soft, chewy center. The trick to getting this combo is baking them in a muffin tin. Not only is it easy and convenient, but it also keeps the cookies from spreading out while baking, giving them the chewy center. And because the batter is touching the pan all the way around, you get a nice, crispy edge. It’s like the corner piece of a pan of brownies, but all around! Once again, it’s like unicorns invaded your dreams and made your wishes come true.
And whipping up these high protein treats couldn’t be any easier. As long as you’ve got a blender or food processor you’re in business, because we’re going to puree some chickpeas. Just trust me on this one. These little gems are going to give your cookies some texture, chewiness, and replaces the flour so the cookies are grain-free. Once you’ve got them pureed, all you need to do is mix the dry ingredients, stir together the wet ingredients, and then combine that all together.
Preheat the oven to 325 F. Grease a 12 cup muffin tin.
In a food processor or blender, puree the chickpeas with the water until smooth.
In a large bowl, add the coconut flour, protein powder, sweetener, baking powder and soda, and salt.
In a seperate bowl, combine the chickpea puree, egg, yogurt, milk, oil, and vanilla. Stir or whisk until fully combined.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until fully incorporated.
Evenly distribute the batter into the prepared muffin tins. It will be about 1.5 - 2 Tbsps of dough per cookie.
Smooth out the batter so batter touches the edges of the pan, but don't press/flatten the dough.
Bake for 14 min. or until the edges of the cookies turn golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cookie dough comes out clean.
Allow the cookies to cool completely in the pan.
Feel free to top with nut butter, jam, or more chocolate and eat 'em up!

daf6ac54a9cfe7f23d031452747961d6e7935bdf4b1f82c1cbb7da3f72c4942f,"A James Cook University researcher has created a unique process to swiftly identify patients most at risk of dying from sepsis, a condition that claims the lives of more than 3000 Australians each year.
Sixth-year medical student, Satyen Hargovan’s honours research project has generated a check-list of the top 10 factors that influence the survival of sepsis patients.
Sepsis is a common medical condition, where chemicals released by the immune system to fight an infection trigger the inflammation and eventual shut-down of multiple organs.
Some 15,700 patients with sepsis are admitted to Australian Intensive Care Units every year. About one in five die. The cost of treating each case is more than $39,000.
“The burden of sepsis is not only in relation to patient outcomes, but also the financial cost to the healthcare system,” Mr Hargovan said.
His project, known as the Cairns Sepsis Model – 4 (CSM- 4) is designed to speed up the assessment of patients within their first four hours in ICU.
The new four-hour mortality prediction model will enable clinicians to detect patients who are at a higher risk of dying, then help to guide their treatment decisions and discussions with the patient and their family.
“Essentially it means that if a patient has a five percent chance of dying, you might treat them less invasively,” he said. “For example, you won’t rush to place them in an induced coma, or insert lines into large arteries or veins.
Mr Hargovan began his research by reviewing more than 50 mortality prediction studies, but soon realized that there was no model in the world specifically designed to predict mortality in adult sepsis patients within four hours of ICU admission.
A case history review of 500 adult sepsis patients admitted to the Cairns Hospital ICU over a four-year period identified 168 factors that could influence patient health outcomes, ranging from age, gender and socio-economic status to type of infection, degree of organ failure, vital signs, blood test results and treatment regimes.
Statistical analysis whittled the figure down to the 10 most significant factors, which include age, history of renal disease, level of consciousness, and abnormal levels of certain substances in the blood that represent varying degrees of organ dysfunction.
The mortality prediction model is inexpensive to use as it largely relies on information easily gleaned from patient history, physical examination, and blood tests that are routinely conducted on patients within their first four hours of admission to an ICU.
The next step involves testing his model on a different and larger set of patients in order to validate his research, before it can be accepted for clinical use.
“Then we’d love to create an online calculator or an app that clinicians can use easily, at the bedside, and have a result within seconds,” he said.
Satyen Hargovan (Mr Hargovan will be available for interviews at the Cairns Hospital).
Associate Professor Alan de Costa. Dr de Costa will be available for interview on Tuesday in Cairns.

I am making it weekly because they love it so much. The recipe is fabulous, but needed some tweaks. I doubled the recipe and added 2 eggs, used organic brown rice flour in place of wheat, and substituted 1/2 tsp garlic powder and hot water for the chicken broth. The cookies keep well in the fridge. I made these for my Yorkie/Rat Terrier mix and when they came out of the oven his tail was wagging just from the smell. He LOVES them. What can I substitute for the cheese in this dog treat recipe? I don't feed my dog cheese (let's be honest--it's basically junk food that doesn't belong in an adult dog's diet). Is there anything that you recommend substituting the cheese with? Or can I just leave it out? You could substitute the cheese for an 1/8 cup of ground flax or wheat bran. Is there something else I could use besides oats and wheat flour for this recipe? Chef's Comments ~ That's a great question. You can easily substitute the flour in this and most of our dog treat recipes. A few good grain free flours include almond flour, chickpea flour, potato flour and soy flour. Most of those flours should be available at a major grocery store. As far as substituting the oats, that's a little trickier, but it can be done. The oats are in the recipe for texture and soaking up moisture, so that's what you'll need to replace. First, you will want to halve the amount of oats and add an extra 1/2 cup of flour (or a mixture of the previously mentioned flours). Then you can add a 1/2 cup combination of unsweetened coconut, chopped peanuts and crumbled almond crackers. Or, you could replace all of the oats with the flour mixture. Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? If so, does it still need to be microwaved? Chef's Answer ~ That's a great question! :) I haven't tried this recipe with fresh spinach, but I don't see why it couldn't work. If you minced the spinach very fine, my guess is that you would not need to microwave, or otherwise cook, the spinach before adding it to the dog treat dough. Comments for Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? Is it necessary to store these cookies in a Refrigerator? Since these are cookies, can it be kept in air tight container outside? And how long would it last if this is done? Chef's Comments ~ You can get lots of tips on How to Store Dog Treats on my website. Unless you live in a very cold climate, most dog treats need to be kept indoors, and even better in the refrigerator. My dogs is algeric to grain. What can I use instead of the whole whear flour? My Husky can't have grain. What can I use besides whole wheat flour. You should put more recipes with no grain in them. Chef's Answer ~ You can replace the wheat flour in most of my dog treat recipes with a non-grain flour. For example, any type of bean flour like Chick Pea (Garbanzo Bean) flour, or ""flours"" from nuts. They are technically nut meals, but they work as flour, for example almond meal. You should be able to find grain free flours at specialty grocery stores, or at health food stores. Very good simple recipe, however wheat flour isn't something I would normally have in my cupboard. Would it be ok to use plain flour or self raising? Chef's Answer ~ Yes, you can use all purpose flour in place of the whole wheat flour. I do not recommend using self-rising flour because it has the addition of baking powder or baking soda added to it. These are things that homemade dog treats do not need. Can fresh/raw spinach be used in place of frozen spinach in a particular dog treat recipe, and does it need to be cooked beforehand?","1, the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the,,, and the the, and the, and the, and the the the the the the, and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the, and the, and the the the the the the the, and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the, and the, and the, and the, and the the the the the the the the the the the, and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the"

During school, I got interested in advertising, and started an internship at Mullen Lowe Istanbul and TBWA Istanbul to practice on creative thinking and art direction. After that, I started to work for Big34, and a year after I accepted for Manajans/JWT. It was the most important years of my career.
I worked on important advertising campaigns of global clients, and won national and international advertising awards as Crystal Apple, Cannes Lions. I’m currently working for Propaganda Advertising Agency, and continue to design creative ideas for our clients.
I work for advertising agencies as an art director since 2009. I work for global and local clients as Nokia, Elidor/Sunsilk, Bosch, Shell, Turkcell, Mazda, Kia, Turkish Airlines, Hyundai, Nestle, Beko, Michelin, BMW, Red Bull, Mitsubishi Electric, Bayer, etc. I work mostly full-time at the office, and these days I also design mobile games with a freelance team.
I learnt that I should keep learning. As the technology and the design trends develop day by day, designers should stay updated. Last year I attended a design week about UX and digital design in London to learn more about digital design principles. During the week, I attended workshops at the design offices, and met designers from all over the world. It was a great experience to compare myself, and now I have new targets for my career.
I always try to find an exciting idea to get inspired. It can be anything – an interesting visual, a strong speech, a good music, anything. To find it, I make a quick research, take some notes and draw sketches. After, I brainstorm with our creative team and we share our ideas. Then the design process starts, I put on my headphones and focus on the design. After designing many alternatives, we make a discussion with our creative team and choose the best one.
The main materials I use are a blank sheet, a pen and creative thinking. All other tools and computer programs help to complete the final process.
Currently I work for Propaganda Advertising Agency. We have a beautiful office at the center of Istanbul with a nice view. I usually go to work around 9:30 am, have my breakfast while reading the news and after that the work begins. I work with a copywriter, and our team lead by a creative director. We usually make meetings at the beginning of the week with our brand executives, and we make a schedule for the deadlines. I usually work until 6:00 – 7:00 pm during the week, but under curtain some circumstances, we work overtimes and also weekends.
As my carreer began, I mostly worked on advertising campaigns, print materials, 360 ideas and digital advertising. Recently, I have been interested in UI, UX and digital design, and want to combine my creative background on advertising with the innovative projects.
During my short study in London last year, I had the chance to work and share my ideas with the designers all over the world, and I discovered things that I had never seen before.
I always believe that a designer should be in contact with all other designers and I want to cross the borders and surround myself with creative people around the world in my own studio.
