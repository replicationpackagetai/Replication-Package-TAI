1. Create an HTML file with a canvas element.
2. Add a JavaScript file to handle the drawing logic.
3. Use the canvas API to draw on the canvas.

Here's an example of how you can implement this:

1. HTML file (index.html):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Canvas Drawing</title>
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id=""myCanvas"" width=""500"" height=""500"" style=""border:1px solid #000000;""></canvas>
    <script src=""script.js""></script>
</body>
</html>
```

2. JavaScript file (script.js):

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

let isDrawing = false;
let lastX = 0;
let lastY = 0;

canvas.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
    isDrawing = true;
    [lastX, lastY] = [e.offsetX, e.offsetY];
});

canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
    if (!isDrawing) return;
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.moveTo(lastX, lastY);
    ctx.lineTo(e.offsetX, e.offsetY);
    ctx.stroke();
    [lastX, lastY] = [e.offsetX, e.offsetY];
});

canvas.addEventListener('mouseup', () => {
    isDrawing = false;
});

canvas.addEventListener('mouseout', () => {
    isDrawing = false;
});
```

This code sets up a canvas element and adds event listeners for mouse events. When the user clicks and drags the mouse, a line is drawn on the canvas between the last position and the current position. The `isDrawing` flag is used to determine whether the user is currently drawing or not.

You can further customize the drawing behavior by modifying the code, such as changing the line color, width, or adding more complex drawing features."

1. Create an HTML file with a table structure.
2. Use Ruby to generate the table rows and cells with the comparison data.
3. Save the HTML file.

Here's a Ruby script that generates an HTML table with the comparison data:

```ruby
require 'erb'

# Comparison data
comparison_data = {
  cost: {
    traditional: ""Higher"",
    online: ""Lower""
  },
  flexibility: {
    traditional: ""Less"",
    online: ""More""
  },
  interaction: {
    traditional: ""Face-to-face"",
    online: ""Virtual""
  },
  resources: {
    traditional: ""Physical classrooms, libraries, etc."",
    online: ""Online resources, virtual libraries, etc.""
  },
  learning_outcomes: {
    traditional: ""Varies by institution"",
    online: ""Varies by institution""
  }
}

# Render the HTML template with the comparison data
html = ERB.new(template).result(binding)

# Save the HTML file
File.write(""comparison.html"", html)

This script uses the `ERB` library to generate the HTML table with the comparison data. The `comparison_data` hash contains the comparison data for each aspect, and the script iterates over the hash to generate the table rows and cells.

To create a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table, you can use a Ruby gem like `gruff`"

The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]

In fixing that yield, account shall be taken, in respect of each method of cultivation as referred to in paragraph 3, of the yields which are representative of the general trend revealed by sampling carried out by the producer Member States. The sampling shall be made, in respect of each of those methods of cultivation, on a representative percentage of the land under soya, having regard to the geographical distribution of such land.3. Each year after the harvest one or more homogeneous production areas shall be established for irrigated and for non-irrigated soya by reference to the factors which have influenced production conditions. The areas shall be established with particular reference to regions which are representative of the crop obtained from each of those methods of cultivation.4. Each year an indicative yield shall be fixed for each of the areas and methods of cultivation referred to in paragraph 3.'

20. What's is the sum of the squares of all factors of 210?","The prime factorization of 210 is 210 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7.
Let's say the factors of 210 are a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12, a13, a14, a15, a16, a17, a18, a19, a20, a21, a22, a23, a24, a25, a26, a27, a28, a29, a30.
Then, the sum of the squares of all factors of 210 is a1^2 + a2^2 + a3^2 + a4^2 + a5^2 + a6^2 + a7^2 + a8^2 + a9^2 + a10^2 + a11^2 + a12^2 + a13^2 + a14^2 + a15^2 + a16^2 + a17^2 + a18^2 + a19^2 + a20^2 + a21^2 + a22^2 + a23^2 + a24^2 + a25^2 + a26^2 + a27^2 + a28^2 + a29^2 + a30^2.
We can use the formula for the sum of the squares of the factors of a number. The formula is (1 + p1^2 + p2^2 + ... + pn^2) * (1 + p1 + p1^2 + ... + p1^k1) * (1 + p2 + p2^2 + ... + p2^k2) * ... * (1 + pn + pn^2 + ... + pn^kn), where p1, p2, ..., pn are the prime factors of the number, and k1, k2, ..., kn are the highest powers of the prime factors in the prime factorization of the number.

By default, sudo is configured to require a password for each command. However, it is possible to configure sudo to allow passwordless sudo for specific users or commands. This can be useful in certain situations, such as when running automated scripts that require sudo privileges. In this article, we will discuss how to configure sudo to allow passwordless sudo for specific users or commands.
To configure sudo to allow passwordless sudo for a specific user, you can use the NOPASSWD option in the sudoers file. The sudoers file is a configuration file that controls the sudo privileges of users. It is located in the /etc/sudoers file and should only be edited using the visudo command to prevent syntax errors.
To configure sudo to allow passwordless sudo for a specific user, you can use the following command:
sudo visudo
This will open the sudoers file in the vi editor. You can then add the following line to the file:
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
Replace ""username"" with the name of the user you want to allow passwordless sudo for. This line grants the specified user passwordless sudo privileges on all hosts and for all commands.
To configure sudo to allow passwordless sudo for a specific command, you can use the following line in the sudoers file:
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/path/to/command
Replace ""username"" with the name of the user you want to allow passwordless sudo for, and ""/path/to/command"" with the path to the command you want to allow passwordless sudo for.
It is important to note that allowing passwordless sudo can be a security risk, as it allows users to run commands with elevated privileges without being prompted for a password. Therefore, it should only be used in situations where it is necessary and appropriate.
In conclusion, configuring sudo to allow passwordless sudo for specific users or commands can be useful in certain situations. However, it is important to carefully consider the security implications of doing so and to use it only when necessary."

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy shrank by 20.4% in the second quarter of 2020, the worst affected of major industrial nations."

However, if you are using a string that contains a = symbol as a regular expression pattern, you may need to escape it depending on the context and the regex engine you are using.
For example, in Python's re module, you can use the re.escape() function to escape special characters in a string. This function will escape all characters that have special meanings in regular expressions, including =.
Here's an example:
```python
import re

pattern = ""=+""
escaped_pattern = re.escape(pattern)
print(escaped_pattern)  # Output: \=\+
```

In this example, the = symbol is escaped with a backslash (\) to make it a literal character in the regular expression pattern.
If you are using a string that contains a = symbol as a regular expression pattern, you may need to escape it depending on the context and the regex engine you are using. For example, if you are using a string that contains a = symbol as a regular expression pattern in a Python script, you may need to escape it to make it a literal character in the pattern.
Here's an example:
```python
import re

pattern = ""=+""
string = ""This is a test string with = symbols.""
matches = re.findall(pattern, string)
print(matches)  # Output: []
```

In this example, the regular expression pattern =+ is used to match one or more = symbols in the string. However, the = symbol is not a special character in this context, so it is not necessary to escape it.
If you are using a string that contains a = symbol as a regular expression pattern in a different context, such as a command-line tool or a web application, you may need to escape it to make it a literal character in the pattern. For example, if you are using a string that contains a = symbol as a regular expression pattern in a command-line tool, you may need to escape it to make it a literal character in the pattern.
Here's an example:
```bash
$ grep ""=+"" test.txt
```

In this example, the regular expression pattern =+ is used to match one or more = symbols in the file test.txt. However, the = symbol is not a special character in this context, so it is not necessary to escape it.
In summary, you don't need to escape the = symbol in a regular expression, but you may need to"

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Kimmel's statement about Trump playing golf more than any other president highlights the lack of significant accomplishments during his presidency. Instead of focusing on tangible achievements, Trump has spent a considerable amount of time on leisure activities, which Kimmel believes is unfair. This criticism is part of a larger critique of Trump's presidency, which Kimmel argues has been marked by a lack of meaningful progress and a focus on personal interests over the well-being of the American people."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating. 
 Answer: is fond of collecting family life photographs

The beach is also a place where I can connect with nature. I love to watch the birds flying overhead and the fish swimming in the water. I love to feel the sand between my toes and the waves against my legs. It is a place where I can appreciate the beauty of the world around me.

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

The model should employ advanced natural language processing techniques, such as entity recognition and semantic analysis, to enhance its ability to detect subtle nuances in language and provide more accurate predictions. Additionally, the model should be trained on a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages to ensure its robustness and generalizability.","To develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately differentiate positive and negative emotions expressed in textual content, we can follow these steps:

1. Data Collection: Collect a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages. This will help the model to be robust and generalizable. Some popular datasets for sentiment analysis include the IMDB movie reviews dataset, the Yelp review dataset, and the Twitter sentiment analysis dataset.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters. Tokenize the text into individual words or phrases. Perform stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.

3. Feature Extraction: Extract features from the text using techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings. Word embeddings, such as Word2Vec or GloVe, can capture the semantic meaning of words and provide a more accurate representation of the text.

4. Model Selection: Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for sentiment analysis. Some popular algorithms include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). For more advanced techniques, we can use deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Transformer models.

5. Model Training: Train the model on the preprocessed and feature-extracted data. Use cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's robustness and avoid overfitting. Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.

6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Use a separate test dataset to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

7. Model Deployment: Deploy the model in a production environment where it can be used to analyze sentiment in real-time. Consider using cloud-based services such as AWS or Google Cloud to host the model and provide a RESTful API for easy integration with other applications.

8. Continuous Improvement: Continuously monitor the model's performance and update it with new data to ensure its accuracy and relevance. Use techniques such as active learning or transfer learning to improve the model's performance over time.

By following these steps, we can develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately differentiate positive and negative emotions expressed in textual content. The model will employ advanced natural language processing techniques, such as entity recognition and semantic analysis, to enhance its ability to detect subtle nuances in language and provide more accurate predictions."

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"You can use base64 encoding to achieve this. Here's an example of how you can do it in JavaScript:

```javascript
function encodeString(str) {
  return btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(str)));
}

function decodeString(str) {
  return decodeURIComponent(escape(atob(str)));
}

const originalString = ""This is a long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";
const encodedString = encodeString(originalString);
console.log(encodedString); // Output: VGhpcyBpcyBhIHRvIHN0cmluZyB0aGUgZGVjb2RlIGFuZCBzYW5kIHRvIGEgVUlEIHN1Ym1pdCB3aXRoYSB1cmw=
const decodedString = decodeString(encodedString);
console.log(decodedString); // Output: This is a long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL.
```

In this example, the `encodeString` function takes a string and encodes it using `encodeURIComponent` to handle special characters, then converts it to a base64 string using `btoa`. The `decodeString` function does the reverse, decoding the base64 string and then converting it back to the original string using `atob` and `decodeURIComponent`.

Note that the encoded string may still be longer than the original string, but it should be shorter than the original string in most cases. If you need to further shorten the string, you can consider using a URL shortening service or a custom encoding algorithm."

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.

Character 2: John, a 30-year-old artist who is passionate about his work and values creativity and authenticity. He is not as focused on success as Sarah is and is more concerned with living a fulfilling life.

Conflict: Sarah and John are both working on a project for a major client. Sarah is determined to win the project for her company and will do whatever it takes to get it, even if it means compromising on the quality of the work. John, on the other hand, is more concerned with creating something that is true to his vision and values, and is willing to turn down the project if it means compromising on his principles. This leads to a conflict between the two as they struggle to find a way to work together while maintaining their individual values and goals."

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","The ambiance and dining options at Congham Hall Hotel set it apart from other hotels in the area.

A group has the following properties: uid, name, thumbnail\_url, creation\_date
This API must be written in Python, using FastAPI and pydantic for DTO.
DTO names must end with ""DTO"".
I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","Sure, here's a basic implementation of the REST API using FastAPI and Pydantic. I've separated the read and write DTOs as requested.

First, let's define the DTOs:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from datetime import datetime

class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: int
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: datetime

class GroupWriteDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
```

Next, let's create the FastAPI application and define the routes:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from typing import List

app = FastAPI()

# In-memory storage for groups
groups = []

@app.post(""/groups/"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
def create_group(group: GroupWriteDTO):
    new_group = GroupReadDTO(**group.dict(), uid=len(groups) + 1, creation_date=datetime.now())
    groups.append(new_group)
    return new_group

@app.get(""/groups/"", response_model=List[GroupReadDTO])
def read_groups():
    return groups

@app.get(""/groups/{group_id}"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
def read_group(group_id: int):
    group = next((g for g in groups if g.uid == group_id), None)
    if group is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=""Group not found"")
    return group

@app.put(""/groups/{group_id}"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
def update_group(group_id: int, group: GroupWriteDTO):
    for g in groups:
        if g.uid == group_id:
            g.name = group.name
            g.thumbnail_url = group.thumbnail_url
            return g
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=""Group not found"")

@app.delete(""/groups/{group_id}"")
def delete_group(group_id: int):
    global groups
    groups = [g for g in groups if g.uid != group_id]
    return {""detail"": ""Group deleted""}
```

This implementation provides the following endpoints:

- `POST /groups/`: Create a new group.
- `GET /groups/`: Retrieve all groups.
- `GET /groups/{group_id}`: Retrieve a specific group by ID.
- `PUT /groups/{group_id}`: Update a specific group by ID.
- `DELETE /groups/{group_id}`: Delete"

The flight patterns of Tabanus can vary depending on the region, climate, and availability of food sources. For example, in some regions, Tabanus may be more active during the day, while in others, they may be more active at night. Additionally, the flight patterns of Tabanus can also be influenced by the availability of food sources, such as livestock or wild animals. In regions where there is a high density of livestock, Tabanus may be more active during the day when the animals are grazing. In regions where there is a high density of wild animals, Tabanus may be more active at night when the animals are more active. Overall, the flight patterns of Tabanus can vary depending on the region and the availability of food sources."

Here are some steps to help you prepare for a successful business presentation:

1. Define your objective: Before you start preparing your presentation, you need to define your objective. What do you want to achieve with your presentation? Do you want to inform, persuade, or entertain your audience? Knowing your objective will help you structure your presentation and choose the right content.

2. Know your audience: Understanding your audience is crucial for a successful presentation. Who are they? What are their interests and needs? What do they expect from your presentation? Knowing your audience will help you tailor your presentation to their needs and interests.

3. Research your topic: Research is key to a successful presentation. Gather information from reliable sources and organize it in a way that supports your objective. Use statistics, case studies, and examples to make your presentation more compelling.

4. Create an outline: Once you have your research, create an outline for your presentation. This will help you organize your thoughts and ensure that your presentation flows logically. Make sure to include an introduction, body, and conclusion.

Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
