One approach is to incorporate green building practices, such as using energy-efficient materials and appliances, and incorporating renewable energy sources like solar panels. Another approach is to design communities that are walkable and have access to public transportation, reducing the need for cars and thus reducing carbon emissions. Additionally, developers can incorporate green spaces and water-saving features, such as rain gardens and permeable pavement, to help manage stormwater runoff and reduce the impact on local ecosystems. Finally, developers can work with local governments and community organizations to create policies and programs that support sustainable development, such as incentives for green building and zoning regulations that encourage walkable, mixed-use communities."

1. Check the Docker Compose file for typos or incorrect syntax. Make sure the service names, container names, and image names are spelled correctly and that the file is saved with the correct extension (.yml or .yaml).

2. Ensure that the Docker images are correctly built and pushed to the Docker Hub or a private registry. If you're using a custom image, make sure it's available in the Docker Hub or your private registry.

3. Check the network settings in your Docker Compose file. Make sure that the services are correctly linked and that the network settings are correct.

4. If you're using a custom Dockerfile, make sure that it's correctly written and that it includes the necessary commands to install and configure the application.

5. Check the logs of the Docker containers to see if there are any error messages that might help you diagnose the issue.

6. If you're using a custom Docker network, make sure that it's correctly configured and that the containers can communicate with each other.

7. If you're using a custom Docker volume, make sure that it's correctly configured and that the containers can access it.

8. If you're using a custom Docker secret, make sure that it's correctly configured and that the containers can access it.

9. If you're using a custom Docker config file, make sure that it's correctly configured and that the containers can access it.

10. If you're using a custom Docker network alias, make sure that it's correctly configured and that the containers can access it.

If none of these solutions work, you might want to consider reaching out to the Docker community for help. They can provide additional guidance and troubleshooting tips."

```php
<?php
$target_dir = ""uploads/"";
$target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES[""fileToUpload""][""name""]);
$imageFileType = strtolower(pathinfo($target_file,PATHINFO_EXTENSION));

// Check if image file is a actual image or fake image
if(isset($_POST[""submit""])) {

    } else {
        echo ""File is not an image."";
    }
}
?>
```

This code creates a directory called ""uploads"" if it doesn't exist already. It then checks if the uploaded file is an actual image file or not. If it is, it moves the file to the target directory and displays a success message. If it's not, it displays an error message.

You can customize this code to fit your specific needs, such as adding validation for the file size and type, or adding error handling for cases where the upload fails."

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]
Student:","[[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]

The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -7, 39, 4, 23 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has -26, -3, 32, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. The fourth list has -3, 20, -14, -38 for odd integers so the fourth output is 45. The fifth list has -20, -26, -30, -46, -49 for odd integers so the fifth output is -135. The sixth list has -19, 28, -39 for odd integers so the sixth output is 45. The seventh list has 43, 8 for odd integers so the seventh output is 45. The eighth list has -44, -16, 29 for odd integers so the eighth output is 45. The ninth list has -50, -5, 30, -49 for odd integers so the ninth output is -135. The tenth list has -11, 3, 27, 34, -45 for odd integers so the tenth output is 45.

I am having difficulties with the older students complaining about the younger students and being disrespectful towards them. What are some teaching strategies or activities that encourage team building and bonding between band students?,"I'm glad you're reaching out for advice on fostering a positive and inclusive environment in your band class. Here are some strategies and activities that can help promote team building and bonding among students of different ages:

1. Icebreaker Activities: Start the class with icebreaker activities that encourage students to share something about themselves, such as their favorite music, instrument, or hobby. This can help students get to know each other better and build connections.
2. Group Projects: Assign group projects that require students to work together to achieve a common goal. This can help students learn to collaborate, communicate, and respect each other's ideas.
3. Mentorship Programs: Pair older students with younger students as mentors. This can help the older students feel a sense of responsibility and pride in helping the younger students, while the younger students can benefit from the guidance and support of their mentors.
4. Team-Building Exercises: Incorporate team-building exercises into your class, such as trust falls, relay races, or group problem-solving activities. These can help students build trust, communication, and cooperation skills.
5. Inclusive Classroom Culture: Foster an inclusive classroom culture that values and respects all students, regardless of age or ability. Encourage students to share their ideas, ask questions, and support each other.
6. Positive Reinforcement: Use positive reinforcement to encourage good behavior and teamwork. Praise students for their efforts, and provide constructive feedback to help them improve.
7. Role-Playing Activities: Use role-playing activities to help students understand and empathize with each other's perspectives. For example, have students role-play a situation where they have to work together to solve a problem, and then discuss how they could have communicated more effectively or shown more respect.
8. Classroom Rules: Establish clear classroom rules that promote respect, cooperation, and teamwork. Make sure all students are aware of the rules and understand the consequences for breaking them.
9. Peer Mediation: Train a group of students to serve as peer mediators, who can help resolve conflicts between students in a fair and respectful manner.
10. Reflection Activities: Encourage students to reflect on their experiences and learnings in the class. This"

```lua
local parent = {
  name = ""Parent""
}

local child = {
  name = ""Child"",
  parent = parent
}

print(child.ParentName) -- Output: Parent
```

In this example, the `child` object has a `parent` property that references the `parent` object. The `child` object also has a `ParentName` property, which is a read-only property that returns the name of the parent object.

If you try to use `v.ParentName` outside of the context of a child object, you will get an error.

Lastly, submission with ['id', 'label]. Label consists 0 to 7, and the text column consists of news article data. Write some codes about augmentation, then, classifies via keras with other models ensembled. Validation must be f1 macro.","Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach this problem:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Load the train and test datasets.
   - Split the train dataset into training and validation sets.
   - Preprocess the data by converting the text into numerical vectors using a pre-trained word embedding model like Word2Vec or GloVe.
   - Apply text augmentation techniques like synonym replacement, random insertion, and deletion to increase the dataset size and improve the model's generalization ability.
   - Convert the labels into one-hot encoding format.

2. Model Building:
   - Define a Keras model architecture using convolutional neural networks (CNN) or recurrent neural networks (RNN) or a combination of both (CNN-RNN).
   - Compile the model with a suitable loss function (categorical cross-entropy), optimizer (Adam), and evaluation metric (f1 macro).
   - Train the model on the training set and validate it on the validation set.
   - Save the best model based on the validation f1 macro score.

3. Ensemble:
   - Train multiple models with different architectures and hyperparameters.
   - Combine the predictions of all the models using a simple averaging or weighted averaging method.
   - Evaluate the ensemble model on the validation set and save the best model.

4. Submission:
   - Load the best model and make predictions on the test dataset.
   - Save the predictions in the required format (['id', 'label']) and submit the file.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""

You can do this by using a backslash (\) before the equal sign.

For example, if you want to match a string that contains an equal sign, you can use the following regular expression:

```
import re

pattern = r'(\=)'

text = 'a=b'

match = re.search(pattern, text)

print(match.group(1))  # Output: '='
```

In this example, the equal sign is escaped using a backslash, so it is treated as a literal character instead of a special character in the regular expression.

If you want to match a string that contains an equal sign as part of a variable assignment, you can use the following regular expression:

```
import re

pattern = r'(\w+=\w+)'

text = 'a=b'

match = re.search(pattern, text)

print(match.group(1))  # Output: 'a=b'
```

In this example, the equal sign is not escaped, but it is still treated as a literal character because it is part of a word (variable name) in the regular expression.

If you want to match a string that contains an equal sign as part of a comparison, you can use the following regular expression:

```
import re

pattern = r'(\w+==\w+)'

text = 'a==b'

match = re.search(pattern, text)

print(match.group(1))  # Output: 'a==b'
```

In this example, the equal sign is not escaped, but it is still treated as a literal character because it is part of a comparison in the regular expression.

He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

The sun was shining brightly, casting a warm glow over the lush green grass. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, and the sound of birds chirping could be heard in the distance. I was standing in the middle of a beautiful park, surrounded by tall trees and colorful flowers.

As I walked along the winding path, I couldn't help but feel a sense of peace and happiness wash over me. The park was bustling with activity, but it still felt like a peaceful oasis in the middle of the city. I saw families playing together, couples walking hand in hand, and children laughing and playing.

I stopped to take in the beauty of the park, and I couldn't help but feel grateful for this special place. It was a place where I could escape from the stresses of everyday life and just enjoy the simple pleasures of being outside and enjoying nature.

I continued to walk along the path, taking in the sights and sounds of the park. I saw a group of people playing frisbee, and I couldn't help but smile at the sight of them having fun together. I saw a couple sitting on a bench, holding hands and enjoying each other's company.

I continued to walk, feeling more and more at peace with each step. I couldn't help but feel grateful for this special place, and I knew that I would always cherish the memories of the times I spent here.

I eventually reached the end of the path, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness as I realized that my time in the park was coming to an end. But I knew that I could always come back to this special place, and I would always cherish the memories of the times I spent here.

I turned around and started to make my way back, feeling a sense of peace and happiness wash over me once again. I knew that I would always cherish this special place, and I would always be grateful for the memories I made here.

I continued to walk back, feeling a sense of peace and happiness wash over me once again. I knew that I would always cherish this special place, and I would always be grateful for the memories I made here.

1. **Data Source Company**: This is the company that generates the data to be exchanged. They will create a storage account in Azure and set up a storage queue for the data to be sent.

2. **Data Receiver Company**: This is the company that will receive the data. They will also create a storage account in Azure and set up a storage queue for the data to be received.

3. **Data Exchange**: The data source company will send the data to the data receiver company's storage queue using Azure Storage Queues. This can be done using Azure Functions or Azure Logic Apps.

4. **Data Processing**: Once the data is received, the data receiver company can process the data as needed. This can be done using Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, or any other Azure service.

5. **Data Storage**: The processed data can be stored in Azure Blob Storage or Azure SQL Database for future use.

6. **Data Security**: Azure Storage Queues provide secure data transfer using encryption and authentication. The data can also be encrypted at rest using Azure Blob Storage encryption.

7. **Data Monitoring**: Azure Monitor can be used to monitor the data exchange process and ensure that it is running smoothly.

8. **Data Backup**: Azure Backup can be used to backup the data in case of any data loss.

9. **Data Recovery**: Azure Recovery Services can be used to recover the data in case of any data loss.

10. **Data Reporting**: Azure Power BI can be used to create reports and dashboards for the data exchanged.

The sail is filled with air, which is invisible, and this air is what provides the lift and propulsion needed to move the sailboat forward. The sail is designed to be aerodynamic, which means that it is shaped in a way that allows it to move through the air efficiently and effectively. The sail is also designed to be flexible, which allows it to adjust its shape and size in response to changes in the wind direction and speed. This flexibility allows the sail to capture more wind and generate more lift and propulsion, which helps the sailboat to move faster and more efficiently.

The sail is also designed to be lightweight, which allows it to be easily moved and adjusted by the sailor. The sail is made up of a lightweight material, such as nylon or polyester, which is strong and durable enough to withstand the forces of the wind and the water. The sail is also designed to be easy to handle and control, which allows the sailor to adjust the sail's shape and size in response to changes in the wind direction and speed.

In summary, the reason why a sail is made up of invisible air is because it is a flexible structure that is designed to capture and harness the power of the wind. The sail is filled with air, which is invisible, and this air is what provides the lift and propulsion needed to move the sailboat forward.

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

Climate change is a long-term alteration in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years. It may be a change in average weather conditions, or in the distribution of weather around the average conditions. Climate change is caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, and it is threatening all life on earth by causing extreme weather events, sea level rise, and loss of biodiversity.

Climate change is a complex issue that requires a global response. It is important for all countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the impacts of climate change. This can be done through a variety of measures, such as improving energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy, and protecting forests.

445236e0cd052fbb4b7865c134431e4633e741398172999b027774d4c5674523,What is a CAD/CAM post processor?,"A CAD/CAM post processor is a software tool that converts the output of a CAD/CAM system into a format that can be read by a machine tool controller. It takes the toolpath data generated by the CAM system and translates it into a format that the machine tool can understand and execute. This allows the machine tool to follow the desired toolpath and produce the desired part.

Post processors are an essential part of the CAD/CAM workflow, as they enable the machine tool to understand and execute the toolpath data generated by the CAM system. They are typically written in a programming language that is specific to the machine tool controller, such as G-code or NC code.

There are many different types of post processors available, each designed for a specific type of machine tool or manufacturing process. Some post processors are designed for milling machines, while others are designed for turning machines or other types of machine tools.

Post processors can also be customized to meet the specific needs of a particular manufacturing process or machine tool. This allows manufacturers to tailor the post processor to their specific requirements, ensuring that the machine tool can execute the toolpath data accurately and efficiently.

In summary, a CAD/CAM post processor is a software tool that converts the output of a CAD/CAM system into a format that can be read by a machine tool controller. It is an essential part of the CAD/CAM workflow, as it enables the machine tool to understand and execute the toolpath data generated by the CAM system."
3a8df22b03184fab906db3e76ca37119c8456fde9aa0cd50bedc3a3021ec15ea,What are the current efforts to preserve coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea?,"The Caribbean Sea is home to some of the most diverse and vibrant coral reef ecosystems in the world. However, these reefs are under threat due to various factors such as climate change, overfishing, and pollution. To address these challenges, several initiatives have been launched to preserve and protect coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea.

One such initiative is the Caribbean Challenge Initiative (CCI), which aims to protect 20% of the Caribbean Sea by 2020. The CCI brings together governments, NGOs, and private sector partners to create marine protected areas (MPAs) and promote sustainable fishing practices.

Another initiative is the Coral Reef Alliance, which works to restore and protect coral reefs through various projects such as coral nurseries, reef restoration, and community outreach.

The Caribbean Sea is also home to several marine protected areas, such as the Bermuda Sargasso Sea Reserve, the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System, and the Cayman Islands Marine Park. These MPAs provide critical habitat for coral reefs and other marine life, and help to protect them from threats such as overfishing and pollution.

In addition to these initiatives, there are also several research projects underway to better understand the threats facing coral reefs and develop effective conservation strategies. For example, the Caribbean Coral Reef Evaluation and Monitoring (CREAM) program is a long-term monitoring project that tracks the health of coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea.

Overall, there are many efforts underway to preserve and protect coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea. These initiatives are critical to ensuring the long-term health and sustainability of these important ecosystems."

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.

But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","What sets Congham Hall Hotel apart from other hotels in the area in terms of ambiance and dining options?

Tabanus is a genus of flies that are found worldwide, and their distribution and behavior can vary significantly depending on the region.

For example, in North America, Tabanus species are often found in wooded areas and near bodies of water. They are known to be attracted to humans and animals, and can be a nuisance during outdoor activities. In contrast, in Europe, Tabanus species are more commonly found in grasslands and meadows, and are less likely to be a problem for humans.

In addition, the flight patterns of Tabanus can also vary depending on the species. Some species are more active during the day, while others are more active at night. Some species are also more likely to be found at higher elevations, while others are more common at lower elevations.

Overall, the flight patterns of Tabanus can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the region, the species, and the time of day."

1. Define your objectives: Before you start preparing your presentation, it's important to define your objectives. What do you want to achieve with your presentation? Are you trying to sell a product or service, or are you trying to persuade your audience to take a certain action? Once you have a clear objective, you can tailor your presentation to meet that objective.
2. Research your audience: It's important to understand who your audience is and what they are interested in. Research your audience to find out what their needs and concerns are, and tailor your presentation to address those needs and concerns.
3. Develop your content: Once you have a clear objective and a good understanding of your audience, you can start developing your content. Start by outlining the main points you want to cover, and then flesh out each point with supporting evidence and examples.
4. Practice your delivery: Once you have your content, it's important to practice your delivery. Practice your presentation in front of a mirror or with a friend to get a feel for how you will come across to your audience.
5. Use visual aids: Visual aids can help to make your presentation more engaging and memorable. Use charts, graphs, and images to help illustrate your points and make your presentation more visually appealing.
6. Rehearse your presentation: Once you have your content and your delivery down, it's important to rehearse your presentation. Rehearse your presentation multiple times to ensure that you are comfortable with the material and that you can deliver it smoothly and confidently.
7. Anticipate questions: Anticipate questions that your audience may have and prepare answers for those questions. This will help you to be more prepared and confident during your presentation.
8. End with a call to action: End your presentation with a call to action. This could be a request for your audience to take a certain action, such as visiting your website or contacting you for more information.
9. Follow up: After your presentation, it's important to follow up with your audience. Send a thank you note or an email to your audience to thank them for their time and to follow up on any questions they may have had.

Another key figure is Jane Goodall, who has spent her life studying chimpanzees in Tanzania and advocating for their protection. Other notable environmental scientists include David Suzuki, who is a Canadian geneticist and broadcaster who has been a vocal advocate for environmental issues for decades, and Al Gore, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his work on climate change.

These individuals and many others are working to preserve the natural world for future generations through a variety of means. For example, Rachel Carson's work helped lead to the banning of DDT, a pesticide that was causing widespread harm to wildlife and the environment. Jane Goodall's work has helped raise awareness about the importance of preserving habitats for chimpanzees and other species. David Suzuki has been a vocal advocate for environmental issues, and has helped educate millions of people about the importance of protecting the natural world. Al Gore's work on climate change has helped raise awareness about the urgent need to address this issue and take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

These individuals and many others are working to preserve the natural world for future generations through a variety of means, including research, advocacy, and education. Their work is essential for ensuring that future generations will have the opportunity to enjoy a healthy and thriving planet."

He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
