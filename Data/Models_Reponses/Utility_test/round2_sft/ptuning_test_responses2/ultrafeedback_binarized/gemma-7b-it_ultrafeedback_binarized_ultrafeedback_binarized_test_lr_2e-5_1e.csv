The construction industry is facing challenges in reducing its environmental impact. To address these challenges, developers must consider the following strategies:

* **Use sustainable materials:** Use materials that are made from recycled materials, renewable materials, or materials that are made using sustainable manufacturing processes.
* **Reduce waste:** Use materials that require less waste for construction.
* **Minimize water use:** Use low-flow fixtures and appliances that use less water.
* **Reduce energy use:** Use energy-efficient appliances and lighting.
* **Install renewable energy:** Use solar, wind, or geothermal power to power homes.
* **Reduce pollution:** Use materials that produce less pollution than traditional materials.

why I get 404 error running docker-compose uo
model
Sure, here is a solution for the 404 error when running docker-compose up.

```
docker-compose up
```

If you get 404 error while running docker-compose up command, it could be due to a few reasons. One reason is that the docker-compose.yml file is not valid. This file contains the configurations for the containers that you want to run. If the file is not valid, you will get a 404 error.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot why you are getting the 404 error:
1. Ensure that your docker-compose.yml file is valid.
2. Ensure that you have the correct version of docker-compose installed.
3. Ensure that the docker-compose command is in your path.
4. Ensure that the docker-compose.yml file is in the correct directory.
5. If you have a custom docker-compose.yml file, ensure that it is named correctly and in the correct directory.

Once you have completed the above steps and still get the 404 error, you can try the following commands:
```
docker-compose up -f docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.yml
```
If you have more than one docker-compose.yml file, you need to specify the file name in the command. If you have more than one docker-compose.yml file, you will need to specify the file name in the command.

If you have completed the above steps and still get the 404 error, you can try the following command:
```
docker-compose up -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.yml
```
If you have more than one docker-compose.yml file, you need to specify the file name in the command. If you have more than one docker-compose.yml file, you will need to specify the file name in the command.

If none of the above steps have resolved the issue, try the following command:

How can we create a comprehensive comparison chart in [HTML table] format between traditional education and online education, taking into account the aspects of cost, flexibility, interaction, resources, and learning outcomes, using Ruby code? Moreover, could you share a Ruby script capable of producing a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table?
model
Sure, here's the Ruby script for generating a bar graph comparing traditional and online education based on the information in the HTML table:

```ruby
# Function to generate bar graph
def generate_bar_graph(data)
  # Create a bar chart
  bar_chart = Highcharts.new(""bar"", {
    data: data,
    type: ""bar"",
    title: ""Comparison of Traditional and Online Education"",
    xAxis: {
      categories: [""Traditional Education"", ""Online Education""]
    },
    yAxis: {
      title: ""Number of Students Enrolled""
    }
  })
  # Render the bar chart
  bar_chart.render()
end

# Data to be plotted
data = [
  {
    name: ""Traditional Education"",
    value: 100
  },
  {
    name: ""Online Education"",
    value: 60
  }
]

# Generate the bar graph
generate_bar_graph(data)

# Print the chart to the console
print(bar_chart.to_json())
```

This script generates a bar chart that compares the number of students enrolled in traditional and online education. The data is stored in the `data` array, where each element represents a school type and its corresponding number of students. The script generates the bar chart using the Highcharts library, which is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to create interactive charts.

In order to complete this script, you will need to have the following libraries:
- Highcharts-rails gem
- Ruby-Highcharts library
- Highcharts-js library

Once you have the libraries installed, you can run the script by running the following command:

```ruby
ruby script/generate_bar_graph.rb
```

The output of the script will be a JSON string that contains the data for the bar chart. You can use this JSON string to create a bar chart using your favorite JavaScript library.

In addition to the above, you will need to have the following information:
- The number of students enrolled in traditional education at each school.
- The number of students enrolled in online education at each school.
- The name of each school.

Once you have this information, you can use it to complete the script and generate the bar chart.","Sure, here's the Ruby script for generating a bar graph comparing traditional and online education based on the information in the HTML table:

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

What happens if women have lower body fat percentage than 16?
model
If a woman has lower body fat percentage than 16%, she will be able to wear clothes that are designed for people with normal body fat percentage. However, it is important to note that when you have lower body fat percentage, your body fat percentage will be distributed differently than people with normal body fat percentage. For example, if you have a lower body fat percentage than 16%, you will have less fat in your lower body than people with normal body fat percentage. This means that you will need to wear clothes that are designed for people with normal body fat percentage in order to fit into clothes that are designed for people with normal body fat percentage.","If a woman has lower body fat percentage than 16%, she will be able to wear clothes that are designed for people with normal body fat percentage.

Sure, here is a list of elements of an ideal healthcare market, along with examples of perfect markets and the flaws of the current healthcare market for each element:

| Element | Perfect Market | Current Market Flaws |
|---|---|---|
| **Accessibility:** | Easy access to healthcare services regardless of physical location, financial constraints, or other barriers | Ineffecient systems that fail to adequately address accessibility issues, such as limited availability of services in underserved communities |
| **Equity:** | Equal access to healthcare services regardless of socioeconomic factors, race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. | Ineffecient systems that fail to adequately address equity issues, such as limited availability of services for underserved populations |
| **Quality:** | High quality of healthcare services provided to patients | Ineffecient systems that fail to adequately assess the quality of services provided to patients, leading to potential harm |
| **Affordability:** | Services are affordable to individuals and families | Ineffecient systems that fail to adequately address affordability issues, such as limited availability of services for low-income populations |
| **Timeliness:** | Services are delivered timely, meaning that patients receive services when they need them | Ineffecient systems that fail to adequately address timeliness issues, such as limited availability of services during evening hours |
| **Equity:** | Services are delivered fairly to individuals regardless of socioeconomic factors, race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. | Ineffecient systems that fail to adequately address equity issues, such as limited availability of services for underserved populations |

The current healthcare market is failing to adequately address these issues due to factors such as inadequate infrastructure, limited resources, and systemic bias.

Sure, here is an example of how to do v.ParentName in Luau:

```lua
local function ParentName(v)
  return v.ParentName()
end

print(ParentName(v.Get(v.GetContext().RobloxPlayer.Character.PrimaryPart.Value))
```

This function will return the name of the parent of the object `v`, which is the primary part of the character of the player who owns the object.

You can use this function to find out the name of the parent of any object in the game. For example, if you have a character named ""Bob"" and you want to find out the name of Bob's parent, you can use the following code:

```lua
print(ParentName(v.Get(v.GetContext().RobloxPlayer.Character.PrimaryPart.Value)))
```

This will print the name of Bob's parent, which in this case would be ""Bob"".

You can use this function to find out the name of any object's parent in the game. It is a very versatile function that can be used to find out the name of any object's parent, regardless of the object's position in the game.","Sure, here is an example of how to do v.ParentName in Luau:

How to use passwordless sudo in Linux?
model
To use passwordless sudo in Linux, you must first configure your system to allow passwordless sudo. To do this, you must edit the `/etc/sudoers` file. To do this, you must have root privileges.

To add a user to the sudoers file, use the following command:

```
sudo echo ""user"" >> /etc/sudoers
```

where ""user"" is the user you want to add. You must also add the user to the sudoers file. To do this, you must use the following command:

```
sudo usermod -a user
```

where ""user"" is the user you want to add.

Once you have completed these steps, you must restart the sudo service for the changes to take effect. To do this, use the following command:

```
sudo systemctl restart sudo
```

Once you have restarted the sudo service, you can use passwordless sudo commands. To test this, try the following command:

```
sudo echo ""test""
```

If this command returns an error, then you know that passwordless sudo is not working. If it returns an error, you must troubleshoot.

To troubleshoot passwordless sudo, you must first check if the user is in the sudoers file. To do this, use the following command:

```
sudo grep user /etc/sudoers
```

If the user is not in the sudoers file, then you must add the user to the file. To do this, use the following command:

```
sudo echo ""user"" >> /etc/sudoers
```

Once you have added the user to the sudoers file, you must restart the sudo service for the changes to take effect. To do this, use the following command:

```
sudo systemctl restart sudo
```

Once you have restarted the sudo service, you can try the command again. If it returns an error, then you must troubleshoot.

To troubleshoot passwordless sudo, you must first check if the user has the correct shell. To do this, use the following command:

```
sudo chsh user
```

If the user does not have the correct shell, then you must edit the user's shell to the correct shell. To do this, use the following command:

```
sudo chsh user -shell /bin/bash
```

Once you have added the user to the sudoers file, you must restart the sudo service for the changes to take effect. To do this, use the following command:

```
sudo systemctl restart sudo
```

Once you have restarted the sudo service, you can try the command again. If it returns an error, then you must troubleshoot.

To troubleshoot passwordless sudo, you must first check if the user has the correct shell. To do this, use the following command:

```
sudo chsh user
```

If the user does not have the correct shell, then you must edit the user's shell to the correct shell. To do this, use the following command:

```
sudo chsh user -shell /bin/bash

Sure, here is the answer to the question:

After step 5, the proton joins the nucleus of the atom.

The proton joins the nucleus of the atom after the electron is released. It is the final step in the process of ionization.

In the beginning, there was only the void. Then, God created the first living creature, Adam, and the first woman, Eve. After that, God created the first sin, Adam and Eve's disobedience, and sin's punishment, Adam and Eve were cast out of Paradise.

The sin of Adam and Eve was the first sin. It was committed by Adam and Eve when they ate the forbidden fruit. After that, they were cast out of Paradise. Adam and Eve were cast out of Paradise because they sinned against God's law.

Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK.

Sure, here is an example of a Python regular expression that matches a literal = symbol:

```python
import re
pattern = r""[=]+"".match(r""[=]+"")
print(pattern.match(r""[=]+""))
```

This regular expression will match any literal = symbol in a string.

Here is an example of how to use this regular expression:

```python
text = ""This is a string that has a literal = symbol.""
match = re.search(pattern, text)
if match:
  print(""Match!"")
```

This code will output ""Match!"" if the text contains a literal = symbol.

Here is an example of how to use this regular expression in a real-world scenario:

```python
text = ""This string has a literal = symbol.""
match = re.search(pattern, text)
if match:
  print(""Match!"")

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","user

In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards, and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion found photographs. One of _, called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such as a poster discovered in our drawer.

The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such as Richard Prince, may riding their horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

Answer: Is fond of collecting family life photographs.

## Conceptual Design - Data Exchange between Two Companies using Azure Storage Queues

**Scenario:** Company A and Company B want to share data between companies using Azure Storage Queues.

**Components:**

* **Azure Storage Queues:** Stores data in the form of JSON documents.
* **Event Hub:** Acts as a central event hub where companies register their queues.
* **Event Grid:** Provides event notifications to Company B when data is added to Company A's queue.
* **Messaging Service:** Handles data routing and delivery between companies.
* **Event Hub Client:** Client application that sends and receives events to/from Company A's queues.

**Step 1: Register Event Hub:** Company A registers its event hub and creates a queue in the hub.

**Step 2: Send Event:** Company A sends an event to the event hub containing data in JSON format.

**Step 3: Event Hub Trigger:** Event Hub client listens for events in Company A's queue.

**Step 4: Data Exchange:** Company B receives the event and extracts the data from the JSON document.

**Step 5: Data Storage:** Company B stores the extracted data in its own storage system.

**Step 6: Notification:** Company B is notified about new data being added to Company A's queue.

**Additional Features:**

* **Event Hub routing:** Company A can configure routing rules to direct events to specific queues based on data content and other factors.
* **Event Grid:** Company B can use event grid to subscribe to changes in Company A's queues and receive notifications through various channels.
* **Messaging Service:** Company A can use the messaging service to send messages to Company B through a specific endpoint.
* **Event Hub Client:** Company A and B can use the event hub client to send and receive events.

**Benefits:**

* **Reduced complexity:** Simplifies data sharing between companies.
* **Real-time updates:** Company B receives data updates in real-time.
* **Event-driven architecture:** Enables event-driven data exchange.
* **Standardization:** Provides a standardized way to share data between companies.
* **Security:** Secure data storage and transmission.

**Additional Notes:**

* Use Azure Storage Queues as the primary data store for Company A and Company B.
* Implement data validation to ensure data consistency and quality.
* Use Azure Event","## Conceptual Design - Data Exchange between Two Companies using Azure Storage Queues

model
Sure, here is the question: New mitochondria and chloroplasts are produced through a process similar to binary fission. Explain the similarities between the process of producing new mitochondria and chloroplasts and the process of binary fission in bacteria.

Answer:

Sure, here is the answer to the question:

New mitochondria and chloroplasts are produced through a process similar to binary fission. In bacteria, binary fission is the process by which a cell divides into two identical daughter cells. In eukaryotes, binary fission is the process by which a cell divides into two identical daughter cells. The process of producing new mitochondria and chloroplasts is similar to the process of binary fission in bacteria. Mitochondria and chloroplasts are organelles that are responsible for storing energy in cells. In eukaryotes, mitochondria are located in the cytoplasm of the cell, while chloroplasts are located in the chloroplast membrane of the cell. In bacteria, mitochondria are located in the cytoplasm of the cell, while chloroplasts are located in the chloroplast membrane of the cell. In order to produce new mitochondria and chloroplasts, the cell must undergo mitosis, which is the process by which a cell divides into two identical daughter cells. During mitosis, the cell's DNA is replicated and the cell's cytoplasm is divided into two identical daughter cells. Once mitosis is complete, the cell will have two identical daughter cells.","Sure, here is the question: New mitochondria and chloroplasts are produced through a process similar to binary fission.

Sure, here are the long-term implications of sleep deprivation on physical and mental health:

**Physical health:**

- Cardiovascular health issues such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity
- Metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, glucose metabolism disorders, and metabolic syndrome
- Skin problems such as eczema, psoriasis, and dermatitis
- Chronic pain disorders such as fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis
- Chronic fatigue syndrome
- Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders

**Mental health:**

- Anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder, anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder
- Depression
- Bipolar disorder
- Borderline personality disorder
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder
- Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa
- Substance abuse disorder
- Cognitive impairment
- Behavioral problems such as aggression, impulsivity, and poor decision-making
- Chronic sleep deprivation can also lead to behavioral changes such as irritability, poor judgment, and poor decision-making.

**Comparison of acute versus chronic sleep deprivation:**

The effects of acute versus chronic sleep deprivation differ substantially. While acute sleep deprivation is characterized by transient changes in behavior and cognitive function, chronic sleep deprivation has lasting changes in metabolism, physiology, and behavior. The latter is characterized by changes in metabolism, hormonal imbalance, and impaired cognitive function. Chronic sleep deprivation also changes the brain's chemistry, affecting neurotransmitter systems such as serotonin and GABA.

The effects of acute sleep deprivation are immediate. In comparison to the effects of chronic sleep deprivation, acute sleep deprivation has been shown to have a significant impact on behavior, cognition, and metabolism. Chronic sleep deprivation has been shown to have a significant impact on the metabolism of glucose, insulin, and other metabolic hormones. Chronic sleep deprivation also changes the brain's chemistry, affecting neurotransmitter systems such as serotonin and GABA.

Chronic sleep deprivation also changes the body's physiology, leading to changes in heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and other physiological processes. Chronic sleep deprivation has been shown to have a significant impact on cardiovascular health, metabolic health, and cognitive function.

Overall, chronic sleep deprivation has a significant impact on physical and mental health. It has been shown to cause a wide range of health problems, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment.

What are the current efforts to preserve coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea?
model
Coral reefs are underwater formations made of coral reefs that are home to a wide variety of marine organisms. They are important to the marine ecosystem and provide a variety of benefits to humans. However, the reefs are facing a number of threats, including climate change, pollution, and overfishing.

In the Caribbean Sea, there are a number of organizations working to preserve coral reefs. These organizations include the Caribbean Coral Reef Trust, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the Coral Reef Fund. These organizations are working to raise awareness about the importance of coral reefs and to advocate for their protection. They are also working to develop new techniques to protect coral reefs.

One of the most important things that organizations are doing is to educate people about the importance of coral reefs. Many people are not aware of the importance of coral reefs to the marine ecosystem and to humans. Organizations are working to educate people about the importance of coral reefs and to advocate for their protection. They are also working to develop new techniques to protect coral reefs.

Other important activities that organizations are doing include:

* Educating people about the importance of coral reefs
* Advocating for the protection of coral reefs
* Developing new techniques to protect coral reefs
* Monitoring coral reefs to track their health and condition
* Restoring damaged coral reefs
* Cleaning up pollution in the Caribbean Sea

These activities are important because they help to protect coral reefs and ensure that they continue to exist. They also help to educate people about the importance of coral reefs and to advocate for their protection.

In addition to the threats that coral reefs face from climate change, pollution, and overfishing, coral reefs also face a number of challenges from human activities. These activities include pollution, overfishing, and destruction of coral reefs. These activities are causing coral reefs to decline at an alarming rate.

To protect coral reefs, organizations are working to reduce the impacts of human activities on coral reefs. Some of the most important things that organizations are doing include:

Sure, here is the translation:

The Sierra Leone government has announced plans to cancel the fees for the use of the services of women and children, and to establish a new program to promote fairness in healthcare. This program will be announced at the meeting with investors and donors scheduled to take place on November 18th and 19th in London.

The translation is accurate, but it is not perfect. There are some errors in grammar and syntax that need to be corrected.

As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.

The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.

Are there any differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different regions?
model
Sure, there are differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different regions. For example, in North America, Tabanus exhibits a distinct pattern of migration, characterized by two distinct phases. During the breeding season, Tabanus exhibits a complex pattern of migration, involving the movement of individuals between breeding sites and the movement of entire colonies to new breeding sites. In contrast, during the non-breeding season, Tabanus exhibits a more simplified pattern of migration, involving the movement of individuals to breeding sites and the movement of entire colonies to new breeding sites.

In South America, Tabanus exhibits a different flight pattern than North America. Instead of exhibiting a complex pattern of migration during the breeding season, South American Tabanus exhibits a more simplified pattern of migration. In contrast, during the non-breeding season, South American Tabanus exhibits a more complex pattern of migration, involving the movement of individuals to breeding sites and the movement of entire colonies to new breeding sites.

In East Asia, Tabanus exhibits a different flight pattern than North America and South America. Instead of exhibiting a complex pattern of migration during the breeding season, East Asian Tabanus exhibits a more simplified pattern of migration. In contrast, during the non-breeding season, East Asian Tabanus exhibits a more complex pattern of migration, involving the movement of individuals to breeding sites and the movement of entire colonies to new breeding sites.

The flight patterns of Tabanus vary between different regions due to differences in environmental factors, such as temperature, precipitation, and food availability. In North America, Tabanus exhibits a distinct flight pattern due to its unique environmental conditions. In South America, Tabanus exhibits a different flight pattern due to its different environmental conditions. East Asia exhibits a different flight pattern due to its unique environmental factors.

Does Tabanus exhibit the same flight patterns across different regions?
Sure, Tabanus exhibits similar flight patterns across different regions, but there are slight differences. For example, Tabanus exhibits different flight patterns in different regions due to differences in environmental factors, such as temperature, precipitation, and food availability.","Sure, there are differences in the flight patterns of Tabanus between different regions.

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
