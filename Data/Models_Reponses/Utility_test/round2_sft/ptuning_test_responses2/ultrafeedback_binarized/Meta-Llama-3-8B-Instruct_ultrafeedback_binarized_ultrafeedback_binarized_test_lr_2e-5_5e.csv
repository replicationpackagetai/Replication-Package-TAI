Here are some common reasons why you might get a 404 error:

1. **Docker daemon not running**: Make sure the Docker daemon is running on your system. You can check if it's running by running `docker info` or `docker ps`. If it's not running, start it by running `sudo systemctl start docker` (on Linux) or `docker --start` (on Windows).

2. **Docker Compose configuration issues**: Check your `docker-compose.yml` file for any syntax errors or incorrect configuration. Make sure you have the correct indentation and that all services are defined correctly.

3. **Network issues**: If you're running Docker Compose on a remote server or a virtual machine, ensure that the network connection is stable and that you can access the server or virtual machine.

4. **Port conflicts**: If you're trying to run multiple services that use the same port, you'll get a 404 error. Make sure each service uses a unique port or configure the services to use different ports.

5. **Volume issues**: If you're trying to mount a volume that doesn't exist, you'll get a 404 error. Make sure the volume exists and is correctly configured in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

6. **Docker Compose version issues**: If you're using an older version of Docker Compose, you might encounter issues with newer Docker versions. Try updating Docker Compose to the latest version.

7. **Docker version issues**: If you're using an older version of Docker, you might encounter issues with newer Docker Compose versions. Try updating Docker to the latest version.

8. **System configuration issues**: If you're running Docker Compose on a system with a non-standard configuration, you might encounter issues. Try running Docker Compose on a different system or configuring your system to match the default Docker Compose configuration.

If none of these solutions work, you can try debugging the issue by running `docker-compose up --verbose` to get more detailed output."

This program creates a canvas element and gets a reference to it using `document.getElementById('canvas')`. It then gets a 2D drawing context for the canvas using `canvas.getContext('2d')`.

The program then sets up event listeners for the `mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`, and `mouseout` events on the canvas. When the user clicks the mouse button (`mousedown` event), the program sets a flag `drawing` to `true` and records the current mouse position (`lastX` and `lastY`).

When the user moves the mouse (`mousemove` event), the program draws a line from the last recorded mouse position to the current mouse position if `drawing` is `true`. It then updates `lastX` and `lastY` to the current mouse position.

When the user releases the mouse button (`mouseup` event), the program sets `drawing` to `false`. When the user moves the mouse out of the canvas (`mouseout` event), the program also sets `drawing` to `false`.

This code checks if the form has been submitted, then it gets the file name, type, size, and temporary path. It checks if the file is an image (jpg, png, or gif), and if the file size is within the allowed limit (1MB in this case). If the file is valid, it moves the file to the uploads directory. If the file is not valid, it displays an error message.

Please note that this is a basic example and you should add more validation and error handling to make it more robust. Also, you should make sure that the uploads directory is writable by the PHP script.

Also, you should add a form to your HTML file to upload the image. Here is an example:

```html
<form action=""upload.php"" method=""post"" enctype=""multipart/form-data"">
    <input type=""file"" name=""image"">
    <input type=""submit"" name=""submit"">
</form>
```

This form will send the file to the upload.php file, which will handle the file upload."

Moreover, could you share a Ruby script capable of producing a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table?","Here's a Ruby script that creates a comparison chart in HTML table format between traditional education and online education, considering the aspects of cost, flexibility, interaction, resources, and learning outcomes. It also includes a Ruby script that generates a bar graph comparing the two education models based on the information presented in the table.

First, let's create the comparison chart in HTML table format:

```ruby
# Create the comparison chart in HTML table format
puts ""<table border='1'>
  <tr>
    <th>Aspect</th>
    <th>Traditional Education</th>
    <th>Online Education</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cost</td>
    <td>$10,000 - $20,000 per year</td>
    <td>$1,000 - $5,000 per year</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Flexibility</td>
    <td>Fixed schedule</td>
    <td>Flexible schedule</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Interaction</td>
    <td>In-person interaction</td>
    <td>Online interaction</td>

    <td>Online resources</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Learning Outcomes</td>
    <td>Good learning outcomes</td>
    <td>Good learning outcomes</td>
  </tr>
</table>""

Next, let's create the Ruby script that generates a bar graph comparing the two education models based on the information presented in the table:

```ruby
# Create the Ruby script that generates a bar graph
require 'rubygems'
require 'bar_chart'

# Define the data for the bar graph
data = {
  ""Traditional Education"" => [10000, 10000],
  ""Online Education"" => [1000, 5000]
}

# Create the bar graph
BarChart.new(data, {
  :title => ""Comparison of Traditional Education and Online Education"",
  :x_axis => ""Education Model"",
  :y_axis => ""Cost (USD)""
}).render

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]
Student:","Here is the solution to the problem:

The output list will be: [0, 1170, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here is the explanation for the output:

1. The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0.
2. The second list has -7, 39, 23 for odd integers so the second output is 1170.
3. The third list has no odd integers, so the third output is 0.
4. The fourth list has no odd integers, so the fourth output is 0.
5. The fifth list has no odd integers, so the fifth output is 0.
6. The sixth list has no odd integers, so the sixth output is 0.
7. The seventh list has no odd integers, so the seventh output is 0.
8. The eighth list has no odd integers, so the eighth output is 0.
9. The ninth list has no odd integers, so the ninth output is 0.
10. The tenth list has no odd integers, so the tenth output is 0.

**Perfect Market Elements:**

• **Free Entry and Exit**: Any firm can enter or exit the market without restrictions.
• **Perfect Information**: All firms and consumers have complete and accurate information about the market.

**Healthcare Market Failures:**

| Element | Perfect Market Example | Healthcare Market Failure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free Entry and Exit | Any firm can enter or exit the market without restrictions. | Barriers to entry, such as licensing requirements, make it difficult for new firms to enter the market. |
| Perfect Information | All firms and consumers have complete and accurate information about the market. | Patients may not have access to complete information about treatment options, and providers may not have access to complete information about patient needs. |
| Homogeneous Products | All firms produce identical products. | Healthcare services are customized to individual patients, making it difficult to compare products. |
| Perfect Competition | Many firms compete with each other. | The healthcare market is dominated by a few large providers, limiting competition. |
| No Externalities | No external factors affect the market. | External factors, such as government regulations and insurance reimbursement rates, affect the market. |
| No Monopoly Power | No single firm has the power to control the market. | Large providers and insurance companies have significant market power, which can limit competition and innovation. |

1. Open the terminal and type the command `sudo visudo` to open the sudo configuration file in the default editor.

2. In the file, you will see a line that starts with `Defaults` and ends with `requiretty`. This line specifies that the user must be physically present at the terminal to use sudo.

3. To allow passwordless sudo, you need to comment out this line by adding a `#` at the beginning of the line. This will allow the user to use sudo without entering a password.

4. Save the changes to the file and exit the editor.

5. To test the passwordless sudo, you can use the command `sudo ls` without entering a password.

Note: This method is not recommended for production environments as it compromises the security of your system. It is recommended to use a secure method of authentication such as a password or a biometric scan.

Alternatively, you can use the `sudo -i` command to run a command with the privileges of the root user without entering a password. This method is more secure than passwordless sudo and is recommended for production environments.

Here is an example of how to use the `sudo -i` command:

1. Open the terminal and type the command `sudo -i` to run a command with the privileges of the root user.

2. Enter the command you want to run, for example `ls`.

3. The command will be executed with the privileges of the root user without entering a password.

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:",The UK economy shrank by 20.4% in the second quarter of 2020 due to the impact of the coronavirus lockdown.

Here's an example:

```
import re

pattern = r""hello = world""
match = re.search(pattern, ""hello = world"")
print(match.group())  # Output: hello = world
```

In this example, the = symbol is used as a literal character in the regular expression pattern. It doesn't need to be escaped with a backslash (\) or any other character.

However, if you want to match the = symbol as a special character (for example, if you want to match it as a delimiter), you would need to escape it with a backslash (\). For example:

```
import re

pattern = r""hello\= world""
match = re.search(pattern, ""hello = world"")
print(match.group())  # Output: hello = world
```

In this example, the = symbol is escaped with a backslash (\), which tells the regex engine to treat it as a special character."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Here is a paraphrase of Kimmel's statement about Trump playing golf more than any other president and a connection to his critique of Trump's accomplishments:

Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that Donald Trump has played golf more than 70 times in his first year as president, which is a record. Kimmel used this fact to argue that it's unfair to say Trump hasn't accomplished anything, as he has achieved this feat. However, Kimmel also criticized Trump's accomplishments, suggesting that his efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act are backfiring and that the plan has good qualities, such as covering pre-existing conditions and having no lifetime caps. Kimmel encouraged viewers to keep an open mind and sign up for the plan if they don't have health insurance."

The show is known for its portrayal of strong female friendships and the challenges that come with them. While all episodes of the show touch on these themes, one episode that stands out for its portrayal of female friendship and empowerment is ""The Big O"" from Season 3.

In this episode, the main characters, Maya, Joan, Lynn, and Toni, are all dealing with their own personal struggles. Maya is trying to balance her career and personal life, Joan is struggling with her feelings of inadequacy, Lynn is trying to overcome her fear of intimacy, and Toni is dealing with the aftermath of a recent breakup. Despite their individual struggles, the friends come together to support each other and help each other overcome their challenges.

The episode is a great example of how female friendships can be a source of strength and empowerment. The characters are all able to open up to each other and share their feelings, which helps them to gain a new perspective on their situations. The episode also shows how the friends are able to support each other in different ways, whether it's by offering advice, providing emotional support, or simply being a listening ear.

Overall, ""The Big O"" is a great episode of ""Girlfriends Ahead"" that showcases the themes of female friendship and empowerment. It's a powerful reminder of the importance of having strong female relationships in our lives and how they can help us to overcome our challenges and achieve our goals."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

The moment I step onto the soft, powdery sand, I feel my worries melting away like the gentle lapping of the waves against the shore. The warm breeze carries the sweet scent of frangipani and hibiscus, transporting me to a world of peace and contentment.

As I walk along the beach, the sound of the waves and the cries of seagulls fill the air, creating a soothing melody that calms my mind and lifts my spirits. The sky above is a brilliant blue, with only a few wispy clouds drifting lazily across it, adding to the sense of serenity that pervades the atmosphere.

The beach itself is a treasure trove of natural wonders, with towering palm trees swaying gently in the breeze, their leaves rustling softly against each other. The sand is dotted with colorful beach umbrellas and sun loungers, where people of all ages and backgrounds come to soak up the sun and enjoy the beauty of the surroundings.

As I gaze out at the endless expanse of the ocean, I am struck by the sheer power and majesty of nature. The waves crash against the shore, sending plumes of spray high into the air, and I am filled with a sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world around me.

But it's not just the natural beauty of the beach that makes me happy - it's the sense of community and connection that I feel when I'm there. Strangers become friends as we share stories and laughter, and the beach becomes a place where we can all come together and feel a sense of belonging.

For me, the beaches of Bali are a place of solace and joy, where I can escape the stresses of everyday life and reconnect with the natural world and the people around me. They are a reminder that even in the midst of chaos and uncertainty, there is always beauty and happiness to be found, and that the world is full of wonder and magic waiting to be discovered."

Sail is not made up of invisible air. Sail is a fabric or material that is used to harness the wind to propel a boat or ship. It is typically made of a durable material such as nylon or polyester, and is designed to catch the wind and convert it into motion.

If you are asking about the concept of air being invisible, that is a different topic. Air is a gas that is made up of a mixture of gases, including nitrogen, oxygen, and others. It is invisible because it is a gas and does not have a solid form that we can see. However, we can see the effects of air, such as the way it moves and the way it interacts with objects.

If you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can help with, please let me know."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

The model should employ advanced natural language processing techniques, such as entity recognition and semantic analysis, to enhance its ability to detect subtle nuances in language and provide more accurate predictions. Additionally, the model should be trained on a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages to ensure its robustness and generalizability.","To develop a sentiment analysis model that can accurately differentiate positive and negative emotions expressed in textual content, I propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of various natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The model will employ the following components:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: The input text will undergo preprocessing to remove stop words, punctuation, and special characters. This will help reduce noise and improve the model's ability to focus on relevant information.
2. **Entity Recognition**: The preprocessed text will be analyzed using an entity recognition (ER) algorithm to identify and extract specific entities such as names, locations, organizations, and dates. This will enable the model to better understand the context and sentiment of the text.
3. **Semantic Analysis**: The ER output will be fed into a semantic analysis module that uses techniques such as word embeddings, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing to analyze the meaning and relationships between entities in the text. This will help the model capture subtle nuances in language and provide more accurate predictions.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: The output from the semantic analysis module will be fed into a sentiment analysis module that uses machine learning algorithms to classify the text as positive, negative, or neutral. The model will be trained on a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages to ensure its robustness and generalizability.
5. **Ensemble Learning**: To further improve the model's accuracy, ensemble learning techniques such as bagging and boosting will be employed to combine the predictions from multiple models. This will help reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

The proposed model will be trained on a diverse range of datasets, including:

* **IMDB Dataset**: A popular dataset for sentiment analysis that contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.
* **Stanford Sentiment Treebank Dataset**: A dataset that contains 10,000 movie reviews labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.
* **Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset**: A dataset that contains 1.6 million tweets labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.
* **Google Opinion Rewards Dataset**: A dataset that contains 1.5 million reviews labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.

The model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its performance is robust and generalizable across different domains and languages.

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To solve this problem, we can use the A* algorithm, which is a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm that uses an admissible heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal. In this case, the heuristic function is the Manhattan distance from the current cell to the goal cell.

Here is the step-by-step process to find the optimal path:

1. Initialize the open list with the starting cell (1,1) and set its cost to 0.
2. Initialize the closed list as an empty set.
3. While the open list is not empty:
   a. Extract the cell with the lowest cost from the open list and add it to the closed list.
   b. If the extracted cell is the goal cell, construct the optimal path by backtracking from the goal cell to the starting cell.
   c. For each neighbor of the extracted cell that has not been visited before:
      i. Calculate the tentative cost of reaching the neighbor through the extracted cell.
      ii. If the neighbor has not been visited before, add it to the open list with the calculated tentative cost.
      iii. If the neighbor has been visited before, update its cost if the calculated tentative cost is lower.
4. Return the optimal path.

Here is the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node:

(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)

The total cost of this path is 4."

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","The Ramos Gin Fizz is a classic cocktail that has been around for over a century. It was created by Henry C. Ramos at his bar in New Orleans in 1888. The drink is made with gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water. The ingredients are shaken together with ice and then strained into a Collins glass filled with soda water. The drink is known for its creamy texture and its ability to create a ""bloom"" on the surface of the drink, which is a layer of foam that forms when the drink is shaken.

To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, you will need to follow a few simple steps. First, you will need to add all of the ingredients except for the soda water to a cocktail shaker. Next, you will need to shake the ingredients together with ice for about two minutes. This will help to combine the ingredients and to chill them. After you have shaken the ingredients together, you will need to add a small amount of ice to the shaker and shake it again until the ice has melted. This will help to chill the drink even further and to create a creamy texture.

Once you have chilled the drink, you will need to pour it into a Collins glass filled with soda water. The soda water will help to create the ""bloom"" on the surface of the drink, which is a layer of foam that forms when the drink is shaken. You can also add a splash of orange flower water to the drink to give it a slightly different flavor.

Some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the Ramos Gin Fizz include using a high-quality gin that has a strong flavor, using a fresh egg white that has not been refrigerated for too long, and shaking the ingredients together with ice for the right amount of time. You should also make sure to strain the drink into the glass carefully to avoid creating a mess."

Who they are and why they are in conflict.,"Let me introduce you to two characters, both with their own unique personalities and motivations. Meet Aurora, a free-spirited artist who lives life on her own terms, and Victor, a by-the-book businessman who values order and control.

Aurora is a creative force to be reckoned with. She's a painter, a musician, and a writer, always chasing her next muse. Her art is her passion, and she pours her heart and soul into every piece she creates. She's a hopeless romantic, always believing in the best in people and the world. Her motto is ""live life to the fullest,"" and she's always up for an adventure.

Victor, on the other hand, is a man of precision and discipline. He's a high-powered executive who's built his career on hard work and dedication. He's a perfectionist, always striving for excellence in every aspect of his life. He's a realist, never getting his hopes up about anything, and always expecting the worst. His motto is ""control is key,"" and he's always trying to keep his life in order.

The conflict between Aurora and Victor stems from their vastly different approaches to life. Aurora sees the world as a canvas, full of color and possibility, while Victor sees it as a spreadsheet, full of numbers and limitations. They clash when Aurora's carefree nature disrupts Victor's carefully planned routine. He sees her as irresponsible and reckless, while she sees him as stifling and boring.

Their conflict is a battle of wills, with neither side willing to give in. Aurora wants to live life on her own terms, while Victor wants to control every aspect of his life. They're both right, and they're both wrong. The question is, can they find a way to coexist, or will their differences tear them apart?"

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","The ambiance of Congham Hall Hotel is set apart from other hotels in the area by its tranquil and peaceful atmosphere, which is enhanced by its beautiful gardens and grounds. The hotel's interior is also designed to create a sense of relaxation and comfort, with its elegant decor and spacious rooms. The hotel's dining options are also a major draw, with its 2AA Rosettes restaurant serving a range of delicious dishes using locally sourced ingredients. The hotel's location is also a major advantage, with its proximity to the beautiful Norfolk coast and the historic town of King's Lynn."

I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","Here is an example of how you can implement the views for managing groups of users using FastAPI and Pydantic:

First, let's define the DTOs for reading and writing groups:

```python

from datetime import datetime

class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: int
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: datetime

class GroupWriteDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: datetime
```

Next, let's define the views for managing groups:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.requests import Request
from pydantic import ValidationError
from typing import List

app = FastAPI()

@app.get(""/groups"", response_model=List[GroupReadDTO])
async def read_groups():
    # Implement logic to read groups from database
    return []

@app.get(""/groups/{uid}"", response_model=GroupReadDTO)
async def read_group(uid: int):

    return {}

@app.post(""/groups"", response_model=GroupWriteDTO)
async def create_group(group: GroupWriteDTO):

@app.put(""/groups/{uid}"", response_model=GroupWriteDTO)
async def update_group(uid: int, group: GroupWriteDTO):

async def delete_group(uid: int):
    # Implement logic to delete a group from database
    return JSONResponse(status_code=200, content={""message"": ""Group deleted successfully""})
```

In this example, we have defined four views: `read_groups`, `read_group`, `create_group`, and `delete_group`. Each view handles a specific HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and returns a response in the format specified by the `response_model` parameter.

Tabanus flies are known to exhibit different flight patterns depending on the region, climate, and vegetation. Here are some examples:

1. Migration patterns: Tabanus flies in North America, such as Tabanus lineola, are known to migrate from their summer breeding grounds in the northern United States and Canada to their wintering grounds in the southern United States and Mexico. In contrast, Tabanus flies in Europe, such as Tabanus sudeticus, do not migrate and remain in their summer breeding grounds throughout the year.
2. Altitudinal distribution: Tabanus flies in mountainous regions, such as the Himalayas, are known to be found at higher elevations than those in lowland regions. For example, Tabanus himalayanus is found at elevations up to 4,500 meters in the Himalayas, while Tabanus lineola is found at elevations up to 1,500 meters in the United States.
3. Vegetation preferences: Tabanus flies in different regions have different preferences for vegetation. For example, Tabanus sudeticus is found in forests and woodlands in Europe, while Tabanus lineola is found in grasslands and meadows in North America.
4. Time of year: Tabanus flies in different regions have different flight patterns depending on the time of year. For example, Tabanus sudeticus is active from May to October in Europe, while Tabanus lineola is active from June to September in North America.
5. Weather patterns: Tabanus flies in different regions have different flight patterns depending on weather patterns. For example, Tabanus sudeticus is more active during warm and sunny weather in Europe, while Tabanus lineola is more active during cool and cloudy weather in North America.

These are just a few examples of the differences in flight patterns of Tabanus between different regions. The specific flight patterns of Tabanus flies can vary depending on the region, climate, and vegetation, and more research is needed to fully understand these differences."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences.

 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
