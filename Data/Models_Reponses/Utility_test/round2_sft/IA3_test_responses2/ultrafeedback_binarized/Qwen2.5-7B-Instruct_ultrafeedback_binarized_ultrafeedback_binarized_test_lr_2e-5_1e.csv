When you encounter a 404 error while running `docker-compose up`, it could be due to several reasons. Here are some common causes and troubleshooting steps:

1. **Incorrect Service Name**:
   - Ensure that the service name you are trying to start exists in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     services:
       web:
         image: nginx
     ```

2. **Incorrect Command**:
   - Double-check the command you are using. The correct command is `docker-compose up` (without any service name unless you want to start a specific service).
   - Example:
     ```sh
     docker-compose up
     ```

3. **File Path**:
   - Ensure that the `docker-compose.yml` file is in the correct directory or provide the full path to the file.
   - Example:
     ```sh
     docker-compose -f /path/to/docker-compose.yml up
     ```

4. **Service Configuration**:
   - Check the configuration of the service in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Ensure that the service is properly defined and that there are no typos or missing required fields.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     services:
       web:
         image: nginx
         ports:
           - ""80:80""
     ```

5. **Network Issues**:
   - Ensure that the service is running and accessible. Sometimes, the service might not be running or might not be exposed correctly.
   - You can check the status of the service using:
     ```sh
     docker-compose ps
     ```

6. **Logs**:
   - Check the logs for more detailed information about what might be going wrong.
   - Example:
     ```sh
     docker-compose up --no-start -d && docker-compose logs
     ```

7. **Dependencies**:
   - Ensure that all dependencies required by the service are properly configured and available.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     services:
       db:
         image: postgres
       web:
         image: nginx
         depends_on:
           - db
     ```

8. **Permissions**:
   - Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to run Docker commands.

9. **Docker Version**:
   - Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Docker and Docker Compose. Sometimes"

This metaphor conveys the author's sense of isolation and desolation. The image of a ""ruined fort"" suggests a sense of decay, abandonment, and loss. The word ""inaccessible"" further emphasizes the author's feeling of being cut off from others or from a better state of being. Overall, this opening line sets a tone of melancholy and frustration, hinting at the author's emotional state of feeling trapped and disconnected."

Here are some guidelines to help you determine how many plants you need:

1. **Space Size**: Measure the square footage of your closet office. A general rule of thumb is to have one large plant or several small plants for every 100 square feet (9.3 square meters) of space.

2. **Types of Plants**: Some plants are more effective at removing certain pollutants. Commonly recommended plants include:
   - **Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)**: Good for removing formaldehyde and xylene.
   - **Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)**: Effective at removing formaldehyde, xylene, and trichloroethylene.
   - **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)**: Removes benzene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, xylene, and ammonia.
   - **Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica)**: Good for removing formaldehyde.

3. **Air Quality Concerns**: If you have specific air quality concerns (e.g., high levels of formaldehyde from furniture or paints), you may need more plants or specific types of plants.

4. **Lighting**: Ensure your closet office has adequate light for the plants to thrive. Some plants require more light than others.

### Example Calculation:
- If your closet office is 100 square feet (9.3 square meters), you would need about 1 large plant or several small plants.
- If it's 200 square feet (18.6 square meters), you would need 2 large plants or more small plants.

### Practical Tips:
- **Multiple Small Plants**: If you have limited space, consider using multiple small plants rather than one large one.
- **Air Purifiers**: While plants are beneficial, they may not be sufficient for all air quality issues. Consider using an air purifier as well.
- **Regular Maintenance**: Ensure you water and care for your plants regularly to keep them healthy and effective.

By considering these factors, you can determine the appropriate number of plants for your closet office to help improve air quality."

1. **Hormonal Imbalance**: Low body fat can disrupt hormonal balance, particularly affecting estrogen levels. This can lead to irregular menstrual cycles, amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), and other reproductive issues.

2. **Metabolic Issues**: A very low body fat percentage can affect metabolism, potentially leading to fatigue, weakness, and difficulty maintaining energy levels.

3. **Bone Health**: Low body fat can contribute to a decrease in bone density, increasing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.

4. **Immune Function**: Adequate body fat is necessary for proper immune function. Low body fat can weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections and illnesses.

5. **Psychological Effects**: Low body fat can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and body image issues, especially if it is the result of restrictive eating or excessive exercise.

6. **Physical Performance**: While some athletes may have low body fat as part of their training regimen, for the general population, very low body fat can impair physical performance and overall health.

If you or someone you know has a very low body fat percentage, it is important to consult a healthcare provider to discuss potential underlying causes and to develop a plan to address any health concerns."

However, `v.ParentName` is not a valid property in Lua or Luau.

If you want to access the `Parent` property of an object and then get the `Name` of that parent, you would do it like this:

```lua
local v = script.Parent -- or any other reference to the object
local parentName = v.Parent.Name
```

Here's a breakdown of what this does:
- `v.Parent` gets the parent of the object `v`.
- `.Name` accesses the `Name` property of the parent object.

Make sure that `v.Parent` is not `nil` before you try to access `.Name`, to avoid any potential errors. You can add a check like this:

```lua
local v = script.Parent -- or any other reference to the object
if v.Parent then
    local parentName = v.Parent.Name
    print(parentName)
else
    print(""v does not have a parent"")
end
```

This ensures that you only attempt to access the `Name` property if `v.Parent` is a valid object."

This can be useful for automation and scripting, but it's important to use this feature carefully to avoid security risks.

Here's how you can set up passwordless sudo for a specific user or command:

### 1. **Edit the sudoers File**
   The sudoers file is the configuration file for sudo. You need to edit this file to allow passwordless sudo for a specific user or command.

   - **Using `visudo`:**
     The `visudo` command is recommended because it checks the syntax of the sudoers file before saving it, which helps prevent syntax errors that could prevent sudo from working at all.

     ```sh
     sudo visudo
     ```

   - **Adding a Rule:**
     You can add a rule to allow a specific user to run all commands without a password. For example, to allow the user `john` to run all commands without a password, you would add the following line:

     ```sh
     john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
     ```

     Alternatively, if you want to allow a specific command, you can specify the command instead of `ALL`:

     ```sh
     john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/command_name
     ```

### 2. **Save and Exit**
   After adding the rule, save the file and exit the editor. If you used `visudo`, it will automatically save and exit.

### 3. **Test the Configuration**
   You can test the configuration by logging in as the user and running a command with sudo. You should not be prompted for a password.

   ```sh
   sudo command_name
   ```

### 4. **Security Considerations**
   - **Limit the Scope**: Only grant passwordless sudo access to commands or users that absolutely need it. Avoid granting `ALL` access.
   - **Use Specific Commands**: Instead of `ALL`, specify the exact commands that the user should be able to run without a password.
   - **Regular Audits**: Regularly review the sudoers file to ensure that it still meets your security requirements.

### 5. **Example of a More Restrictive Rule**
   If you want to allow a user to run a specific command without a password, you can specify the command:

   ```sh
   john ALL=(ALL) NOP"

""The Jacaranda Blooms"" by Chip Livingston is a vivid and evocative poem that paints a scene of vibrant, almost surreal beauty. The poem describes a jacaranda tree in full bloom beside a ""drunk stick tree,"" creating a striking juxtaposition. The jacaranda's violent violet petals are personified as weeping with pollen, and a bichofeo (a type of bird) sings passionately about the subject of the poem. The speaker directly addresses the subject, seeing them swell with nectar and hearing them shriek. The poem is rich with sensory details and personification, creating a dreamlike atmosphere that draws the reader into the vivid imagery of the blooming jacaranda and the passionate, almost otherworldly sounds and sights it evokes."

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy contracted by 20.4% in April, May, and June due to the coronavirus lockdown, performing worse than other major industrial nations, with Scotland experiencing a 19.4% decline."

Here are some examples to illustrate this:

1. **Literal `=`**:
   - If you want to match the literal `=` character, you do not need to escape it:
     ```python
     import re

     pattern = r'='
     text = 'a=b=c'
     matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
     print(matches)  # Output: ['=', '=']
     ```

2. **Special Characters**:
   - If `=` is part of a special regex pattern, you might need to escape it depending on the context. For example, `+*?` are special characters in regex, but `=` is not. However, if you are using `=` in a context where it might be interpreted as a special character, you can escape it:
     ```python
     pattern = r'\='  # Escaping the = character
     text = 'a=b=c'
     matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
     print(matches)  # Output: ['=', '=']
     ```

3. **Using `=` in a Pattern**:
   - If you are using `=` in a pattern, you do not need to escape it:
     ```python
     pattern = r'a=b'
     text = 'a=b=c'
     matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
     print(matches)  # Output: ['a=b']
     ```

In summary, the `=` symbol is not a special character in regex and does not need to be escaped unless it is part of a special pattern or you are using it in a context where it might be interpreted as a special character."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that Donald Trump has broken a presidential record by playing golf more than 70 times during his first year in office. This statistic serves as a backdrop for Kimmel's critique of Trump's accomplishments, suggesting that while Trump has spent significant time on leisure activities, he has not achieved much in terms of policy. Kimmel implies that Trump's focus on golf is at odds with the expectations for a president to address important issues, such as healthcare reform, which Kimmel himself has been critical of but sees potential in."

While each episode contributes to the overarching themes of female friendship and empowerment, one episode that particularly stands out is ""The Proposal.""

In ""The Proposal,"" the friends face a significant challenge when one of them, Sarah, is about to get engaged to a man who is not supportive of her career aspirations. The episode delves deeply into the dynamics of their friendship as they navigate this difficult situation, offering support, advice, and encouragement to Sarah. This episode effectively showcases the themes of female friendship and empowerment in several ways:

1. **Support System**: The friends provide a strong support system for Sarah, helping her to stand up for herself and her career goals. They remind her of her worth and the importance of pursuing her dreams, even when faced with external pressures.

Your task is to generate the fill-in-the-blank question for this answer based on the given article. The blanks are always at the end of the question, and can be filled with more than one word or phrase.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

It's a quaint little park nestled in the heart of a bustling city, surrounded by towering skyscrapers and busy streets. Despite its proximity to the urban chaos, this park is a peaceful oasis, a sanctuary where nature and humanity coexist in perfect harmony.

As I step through the gates, the noise of the city fades away, replaced by the gentle rustling of leaves and the chirping of birds. The air is fresh and clean, carrying the scent of blooming flowers and freshly cut grass. The park is a riot of colors, with vibrant flowers in every hue of the rainbow, swaying gently in the breeze.

The centerpiece of the park is a large, serene pond, surrounded by a winding path lined with benches where visitors can sit and enjoy the scenery. The water is still and calm, reflecting the surrounding trees and buildings like a mirror. Occasionally, a fish will break the surface, sending ripples across the water. Ducks and geese paddle lazily around the pond, while dragonflies hover above the water, their wings glistening in the sunlight.

But the real magic of this park lies in its people. It's a place where strangers become friends, and old acquaintances are reunited. Children run and play, their laughter echoing through the trees. Couples stroll hand in hand, lost in conversation. Seniors sit on benches, sharing stories and memories. Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves, and the atmosphere is one of warmth and camaraderie.

As I wander through the park, I feel a sense of peace and contentment wash over me. The worries of the world seem to melt away, replaced by a deep sense of gratitude for this beautiful place. It's a reminder that even in the midst of chaos and noise, there is still beauty and joy to be found. This park is more than just a place to visit – it's a sanctuary, a refuge, and a source of happiness that will stay with me forever."

Sails are typically made of materials such as canvas, nylon, or polyester, which are visible and tangible. However, the force that propels a sailboat is indeed invisible, as it is generated by the wind, which is a form of air movement. Here are some key points to clarify this:

1. **Sail Material**: Sails are constructed from visible, physical materials like fabric, which can be seen and touched.

2. **Wind**: The wind, which causes the sail to move, is a form of air movement. Air itself is invisible.

3. **Sail Force**: The force that moves the sailboat is the result of the interaction between the wind and the sail. This force is invisible but can be observed through the movement of the boat.

4. **Visible Effects**: While the sail and the boat are visible, the wind and the force it exerts on the sail are not.

In summary, sails are made of visible materials, but the wind and the force it generates are invisible."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

[A]: sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period


[Q]: Question: ""What do the factories need to keep their charters?""  Context: ""In the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of Machilipatnam on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted King James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.""  Answer:
****
[A]: high profits


[Q]: Question: ""Which disease does not cause more death than lower respiratory infections, TB or pertussis?""  Context: ""The top three single agent/disease killers are HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria. While the number of deaths due to nearly every disease have decreased, deaths due to HIV/AIDS have increased fourfold. Childhood diseases include pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles and tetanus. Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory and diarrheal deaths. In 2012, approximately 3.1 million people have died due to lower respiratory infections, making it the number 4 leading cause of death in the world.""  Answer:

However, many experts and organizations consider climate change to be the most critical issue threatening all life on Earth. Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Rising Global Temperatures**: The Earth's average temperature has been increasing due to the greenhouse effect, primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. This warming leads to more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and other extreme weather events.

2. **Sea Level Rise**: As temperatures rise, polar ice caps and glaciers melt, causing sea levels to rise. This can lead to coastal flooding, loss of habitat, and displacement of millions of people.

3. **Ocean Acidification**: Increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere leads to more CO2 being absorbed by the oceans, causing them to become more acidic. This can harm marine life, particularly organisms with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons, such as corals and mollusks.

4. **Biodiversity Loss**: Climate change, along with other factors like habitat destruction and pollution, is leading to a rapid loss of biodiversity. This can have cascading effects on ecosystems and the services they provide, such as pollination, water purification, and carbon sequestration.

5. **Food and Water Security**: Changes in climate patterns can disrupt agricultural productivity, leading to food shortages and price increases. Additionally, changes in precipitation patterns can affect water availability, impacting both human and natural systems.

While climate change is a major threat, other issues like deforestation, pollution, overfishing, and pandemics also pose significant risks to life on Earth. Addressing these interconnected challenges requires global cooperation and sustained efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect natural habitats, and promote sustainable practices."

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string into a short, shareable string in JavaScript, you can use a combination of base64 encoding and URL-safe encoding. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Base64 Encoding**: Convert the string to a base64 encoded string.
2. **URL-Safe Encoding**: Replace any characters that are not URL-safe (e.g., `/` and `+`) with characters that are safe for URLs (e.g., `-` and `_`).

Here's a complete example:

```javascript
function encodeString(input) {
    // Step 1: Base64 encode the input string
    const base64Encoded = btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(input)));
    
    // Step 2: URL-safe encode the base64 string
    const urlSafeEncoded = base64Encoded.replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_').replace(/=/g, '');
    
    return urlSafeEncoded;
}

function decodeString(encoded) {
    // Step 1: URL-safe decode the encoded string
    const urlSafeDecoded = encoded.replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/');
    
    // Step 2: Base64 decode the URL-safe string
    const base64Decoded = atob(escape(decodeURIComponent(urlSafeDecoded)));
    
    return base64Decoded;
}

// Example usage
const originalString = ""This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";
const encodedString = encodeString(originalString);
console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);

const decodedString = decodeString(encodedString);
console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base64 Encoding**:
   - `encodeURIComponent(input)` encodes the string to ensure all characters are URL-safe.
   - `unescape()` is used to decode the URL-encoded string back to its original form.
   - `btoa()` converts the string to a base64 encoded string.

2. **URL-Safe Encoding**:
   - Replace `+` with `-` and `/` with `_` to make the string URL-safe.
   - Remove any trailing `=` characters, which are padding characters in base64 encoding.

3. **Base64 Decoding**:
   - Replace `-` with `+` and `_` with `/` to revert the string to its"

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node using heuristic search, we can use the A* search algorithm. A* search uses a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal, which in this case is the Manhattan distance (also known as taxicab or city block distance).

The heuristic function \( h(n) \) for a node \( n \) is the Manhattan distance from \( n \) to the goal node (3,3):
\[ h(n) = |n_x - 3| + |n_y - 3| \]

The cost function \( f(n) \) for a node \( n \) is the sum of the cost to reach \( n \) from the start and the heuristic estimate to the goal:
\[ f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \]
where \( g(n) \) is the cost to reach node \( n \) from the start node (1,1).

Let's apply A* search step by step:

1. **Initialize the open list** with the start node (1,1) and set its \( f \)-value.
2. **Initialize the closed list** as empty.
3. **While the open list is not empty:**
   - **Select the node with the lowest \( f \)-value** from the open list.
   - **If the selected node is the goal node (3,3),** reconstruct the path and return it.
   - **Otherwise, move the selected node to the closed list.**
   - **For each neighbor of the selected node:**
     - **If the neighbor is not in the closed list:**
       - **Calculate the \( g \)-value for the neighbor.**
       - **If the neighbor is not in the open list, or the new \( g \)-value is lower, update the \( g \)-value and set the parent of the neighbor to the selected node.**
       - **Add the neighbor to the open list.**

Let's go through the steps:

### Step 1: Initialize
- Open list: [(1,1)]
- Closed list: []
- Start node (1,1): \( g = 0 \), \( h = |1-3| + |1-3| = 4 \), \( f = 0 + 4 = 4 \)

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz and achieve the ideal foam and bloom, follow these steps and tips:

### Ingredients:
- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz egg white
- 1 oz lemon juice
- 1 oz lime juice
- 1 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz orange flower water
- 1 oz cream
- Soda water (Topo Chico is recommended)
- Ice cubes

### Equipment:
- Cocktail shaker
- Collins glass

### Instructions:

1. **Dry Shake:**
   - Add the gin, egg white, lemon juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your cocktail shaker.
   - Shake vigorously without adding ice for about 2 minutes. This helps to emulsify the egg white and incorporate air into the mixture, which is crucial for creating the foam.

2. **Add Ice and Shake Again:**
   - Add a small amount of ice (about 3 small cubes) to the shaker.
   - Shake again until the mixture is well-chilled or until the ice has mostly melted. This ensures the drink is cold and the ingredients are fully combined.

3. **Strain and Serve:**
   - Pour soda water into a Collins glass first.
   - Strain the cocktail over the soda water.
   - Optionally, you can use a fine mesh strainer to catch any egg white foam that might have separated.

### Tips for Achieving the Ideal Foam and Bloom:

1. **Vigorous Dry Shake:**
   - The key to a good foam is a vigorous dry shake. The longer you shake (up to 2 minutes), the more air you incorporate, which helps create a better foam. However, be careful not to over-shake, as this can cause the egg white to become too frothy and separate.

2. **Proper Egg White:**
   - Use a high-quality egg white. Fresh, cold egg whites work best. If you're using pasteurized egg whites, make sure they are of good quality and not overly processed.

3. **Quality of Ingredients:**
   - Use a reputable brand of simple syrup and orange flower water. The quality of these ingredients can significantly impact the flavor and texture of the drink.

4. **Proper Shaking Technique:**
   - Hold the shaker with both hands and shake it in a circular motion. This helps to distribute the ingredients evenly and incorporate air"

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.

The breakfast buffet is particularly impressive, with a muesli and fruit opening that transforms into a work of art, followed by a choice of a full English breakfast or a healthier spa breakfast.

Additionally, the hotel's Secret Garden Spa offers a range of treatments and therapies, providing guests with a relaxing and rejuvenating experience.

A group has the following properties: uid, name, thumbnail\_url, creation\_date
This API must be written in Python, using FastAPI and pydantic for DTO.
DTO names must end with ""DTO"".
I'd like to separate read DTO from write DTO.","Certainly! Below is an example of a REST API using FastAPI and Pydantic to manage groups of users. The API will include separate DTOs for read and write operations.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages
First, make sure you have FastAPI and Uvicorn installed. You can install them using pip:

```sh
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

### Step 2: Define DTOs

We will define two DTOs: one for reading and one for writing.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class GroupReadDTO(BaseModel):
    uid: int
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
    creation_date: str

class GroupWriteDTO(BaseModel):
    name: str
    thumbnail_url: str
```

### Step 3: Define the Group Model

We will define a simple in-memory model to store the groups.

```python
from typing import List, Dict

class GroupModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.groups: Dict[int, GroupReadDTO] = {}

    def create_group(self, group: GroupWriteDTO) -> GroupReadDTO:

        group_dict['uid'] = uid
        group_dict['creation_date'] = '2023-10-01'  # Example creation date
        self.groups[uid] = GroupReadDTO(**group_dict)
        return self.groups[uid]

    def get_group(self, uid: int) -> GroupReadDTO:
        return self.groups.get(uid)

    def get_all_groups(self) -> List[GroupReadDTO]:
        return list(self.groups.values())

    def update_group(self, uid: int, group: GroupWriteDTO) -> GroupReadDTO:
        if uid in self.groups:

These differences can be influenced by various factors, including climate, availability of hosts, and local ecosystems. Here are some general observations:

1. **Climate and Seasonality**: In regions with distinct seasons, Tabanus species may have different flight patterns. For example, in temperate regions, they might be more active during the warmer months, while in tropical regions, they could be active year-round.

2. **Host Availability**: The abundance and distribution of potential hosts (such as horses, cattle, and other animals) can influence flight patterns. In areas with a high density of hosts, Tabanus may be more concentrated in those areas, leading to more frequent flights in those regions.

3. **Elevation**: In mountainous regions, flight patterns can vary with elevation. Higher elevations might have cooler temperatures, which could affect the activity levels of Tabanus.

4. **Habitat**: Different regions have different habitats, which can influence flight patterns. For instance, Tabanus species in forested areas might have different flight patterns compared to those in open grasslands or wetlands.

5. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Some Tabanus species have evolved specific behaviors to cope with their local environments. For example, some species might be more active during the day in some regions and more active at night in others.

While these differences exist, it's important to note that more detailed studies are needed to fully understand the specific flight patterns and behaviors of Tabanus in different regions. Research in entomology and ecology can provide more precise information on these variations."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
