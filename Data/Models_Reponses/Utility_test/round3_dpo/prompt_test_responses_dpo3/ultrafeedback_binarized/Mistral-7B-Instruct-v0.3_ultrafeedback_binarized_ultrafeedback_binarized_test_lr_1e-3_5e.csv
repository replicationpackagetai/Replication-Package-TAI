Please write in English language.","Sure! Here's a PESTEL analysis for the refrigerated freight market in the U.S. presented in a table format:

| Factor | Positive Impact | Negative Impact |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Political Stability | Ensures consistent trade policies and regulations, fostering growth and investment in the refrigerated freight industry | Unfavorable trade policies or political instability can disrupt supply chains and increase costs |
| Infrastructure | Efficient transportation networks and well-maintained roads and highways facilitate quick and reliable delivery of refrigerated goods | Poor infrastructure can lead to delays, increased costs, and reduced quality of perishable goods |
| Technology | Advanced technology such as GPS tracking, temperature monitoring, and automated vehicles can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure food safety | High costs of implementing new technology can be a barrier to entry for smaller companies |
| Regulations | Strict food safety regulations protect public health and ensure the quality of refrigerated goods | Overly burdensome regulations can increase costs and create barriers to entry for new companies |
| Economy | A strong economy can lead to increased demand for refrigerated goods and increased investment in the industry | A weak economy can lead to decreased demand for refrigerated goods and reduced investment in the industry |
| Competition | Competition drives innovation and efficiency, leading to lower costs and improved service | High levels of competition can lead to price wars and reduced profitability |
| Demographics | Growing demand for refrigerated goods from aging population and increased health consciousness | Shifting demographics and changing consumer preferences can lead to decreased demand for certain refrigerated goods |
| Environmental Regulations | Reduces carbon footprint and promotes sustainability | Increased costs associated with meeting environmental regulations can be a barrier to entry for some companies |
| Energy Costs | Lower energy costs can reduce operating expenses for refrigerated trucks and warehouses | Higher energy costs can increase operating expenses and reduce profitability |
| Labor Costs | Adequate wages and benefits can attract and retain skilled labor | High labor costs can increase operating expenses and reduce profitability |"

This could be due to several reasons, such as incorrect service configurations, network issues, or misconfigured volumes. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Check your Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml) to ensure that the service names, image names, and network configurations are correct.

2. Verify that the images are built and running correctly by running `docker-compose up --build` and checking the logs of each service with `docker-compose logs -f service_name`.

3. Make sure that the containers can reach each other by checking the network configurations in your Docker Compose file and verifying that the services are connected to the same network.

4. If you're using volumes, ensure that the paths are correct and that the files exist in the specified locations.

5. If you're using external services like a database or an API, double-check that they're running and accessible.

6. If you're using custom Dockerfiles, make sure they're correctly built and that the application inside the container is running and configured correctly.

7. If you're still having issues, try to run each service individually with `docker-compose up service_name` to isolate the problem to a specific service or configuration.

8. If you're using a custom domain, make sure that it's correctly configured and that the DNS records are set up correctly.

9. If you're using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Traefik, ensure that the configuration is correct and that the proxy is forwarding requests to the correct service.

10. If you're still having issues, try to run the application outside of Docker Compose to isolate the problem to the Docker setup.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing the 404 error. Good luck!"

Here are five plants that are known for their air-purifying abilities:

1. Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata): This plant is easy to care for and can remove a variety of toxins from the air, including formaldehyde, benzene, and xylene.

2. Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum): This plant is also easy to care for and can remove formaldehyde, benzene, and xylene from the air.

3. Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum wallisii): This plant is known for its ability to remove benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene from the air.

4. Boston Fern (Nephrolepis exaltata): This plant is effective at removing formaldehyde, xylene, and toluene from the air.

5. English Ivy (Hedera helix): This plant can remove benzene, formaldehyde, and xylene from the air.

It's recommended to have at least one plant for every 100 square feet of space to effectively improve the air quality. So, for a closet office of around 100 square feet, you could consider having at least one of each of the plants mentioned above."

For every inner list contained in the input list, you should multiply every odd number in that list. The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list.
Teacher: Now, understand the problem? If you are still confused, see the following example:
[[4, 4, 12, -6], [-9, 5, -6, -1], [8, 3, 9, -5, 1]]
Solution: [0, 45, -135]
Reason: The first inner list has no odd integers, so the first number in the output is 0. The second list has -9, 5, -1 for odd integers so the second output is 45. The third list has 3, 9, -5, 1 as even numbers so the third output is -135. This is a good example.

Now, solve this instance: [[40, -36, 45, -47], [-7, 39, 4, 23], [-26, -3, 32, 1], [-3, 20, -14, -38], [-20, -26, -30, -46, -49], [-19, 28, -39], [43, 8], [-44, -16, 29], [-50, -5, 30, -49], [-11, 3, 27, 34, -45], [23, -44, -39], [10, 39, 39]]
Student:","The solution for the given instance is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

Here's the reasoning:

1. The first list has no odd numbers, so the first output is 0.
2. The second list has -7, 39, 4, and 23, but only 39 is an odd number, so the second output is 0.
3. The third list has -26, -3, and 32, but only 32 is an odd number, so the third output is 0.
4. The fourth list has -3, 20, -14, and -38, but there are no odd numbers, so the fourth output is 0.
5. The fifth list has -20, -26, -30, and -46, but there are no odd numbers, so the fifth output is 0.
6. The sixth list has -19 and 28, but there are no odd numbers, so the sixth output is 0.
7. The seventh list has 43 and 8, but there are no odd numbers, so the seventh output is 0.
8. The eighth list has -44, -16, and 29, but only 29 is an odd number, so the eighth output is 0.
9. The ninth list has -50, -5, 30, and -49, but only 30 is an odd number, so the ninth output is 0.
10. The tenth list has -11, 3, 27, 34, and -45, but only 27 is an odd number, so the tenth output is 0.
11. The eleventh list has 23 and -44, but there are no odd numbers, so the eleventh output is 0.
12. The twelfth list has 10 and 39, but there are no odd numbers, so the twelfth output is 0."

Introduction:

In this project, we developed a chatbot for customer service using Python and the Dialogflow API. The chatbot was designed to handle common customer inquiries and provide quick and accurate responses.

Problem Statement:

Customer service is an essential aspect of any business, but it can be time-consuming and costly. A chatbot can help businesses automate customer service, reducing costs and improving response times.

Approach:

1. Identified common customer inquiries and created intents for each in Dialogflow.
2. Integrated Dialogflow API with Python using the Dialogflow library.
3. Developed a simple user interface for the chatbot using Flask.
4. Tested and refined the chatbot to improve accuracy and user experience.

Results:

The chatbot was able to handle a range of common customer inquiries, including order status, returns, and general inquiries. The chatbot was able to accurately understand and respond to user inquiries in a timely manner.

Conclusion:

The chatbot was a successful project that demonstrated the potential of using AI for customer service. The chatbot was able to handle a range of common customer inquiries and provided quick and accurate responses. The chatbot can be further developed to handle more complex inquiries and integrated with other systems for a more seamless customer experience.

Future Work:

1. Integrate the chatbot with other systems such as the company's CRM and inventory management system to provide more accurate and detailed responses.
2. Develop the chatbot to handle more complex inquiries, such as troubleshooting technical issues.
3. Implement natural language processing (NLP) to improve the chatbot's ability to understand and respond to user inquiries.
4. Test the chatbot with a larger user base to gather feedback and make improvements.

I am having difficulties with the older students complaining about the younger students and being disrespectful towards them. What are some teaching strategies or activities that encourage team building and bonding between band students?,"It sounds like you're dealing with a situation that is quite common in mixed-age group settings. Here are some strategies and activities that can help foster team building and bonding among your band students:

1. **Group Projects**: Assign group projects where students work together on a piece or a specific section of a piece. This encourages collaboration and teamwork.

2. **Mentorship Programs**: Pair older students with younger ones to act as mentors. This can help the older students feel a sense of responsibility and the younger students feel supported.

3. **Ice-Breaker Activities**: Start band class with ice-breaker activities that encourage interaction and cooperation. Examples include warm-up games, team-building exercises, or quick team challenges.

4. **Shared Goals**: Set goals for the class as a whole, such as reaching a certain level of proficiency in a piece, and have students work together to achieve these goals.

5. **Peer Tutoring**: Encourage older students to help the younger ones with difficult sections or concepts. This can help build empathy and understanding between the students.

6. **Group Performances**: Organize performances where students play together in mixed-age groups. This can help students feel a sense of accomplishment and pride in their collective efforts.

7. **Discussion Groups**: Divide students into small groups for discussions about music, instruments, or band-related topics. This encourages active listening and respectful communication.

8. **Shared Experiences**: Plan band outings or events where students can interact outside of band class. This could be a picnic, a concert, or a band-sponsored social event.

9. **Role Models**: Invite professional musicians or older alumni to speak to the class about their experiences and the importance of respect and teamwork in music.

10. **Positive Reinforcement**: Praise and reward positive behavior and teamwork among students. This can help foster a positive and supportive class environment."

If a woman's body fat percentage drops below 16%, it can lead to a number of health issues. These can include:

1. Menstrual Dysfunction: Low body fat can disrupt the menstrual cycle, leading to irregular periods or amenorrhea (absence of menstruation).

2. Fertility Issues: Low body fat can affect ovulation and fertility.

3. Bone Health: Low body fat can lead to osteoporosis, a condition characterized by weak and fragile bones.

4. Hormonal Imbalances: Low body fat can disrupt hormonal balance, leading to symptoms such as mood swings, fatigue, and decreased sex drive.

5. Nutritional Deficiencies: Low body fat can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, which are stored in fat tissue.

6. Impaired Immune Function: Low body fat can weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections and illnesses.

7. Cold Intolerance: Low body fat can make the body more sensitive to cold temperatures, as fat helps to insulate the body and regulate temperature.

8. Skin Changes: Low body fat can lead to dry, thin, and wrinkled skin, as fat helps to keep the skin hydrated and plump.

9. Muscle Loss: Low body fat can lead to loss of muscle mass, as the body breaks down muscle tissue for energy when fat stores are depleted.

10. Organ Dysfunction: Low body fat can affect the function of vital organs, such as the heart, liver, and kidneys.

It is important for women to maintain a healthy body fat percentage for overall health and well-being. If you are concerned about your body fat percentage, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for guidance and advice."

20. What's is the sum of the squares of all factors of 210?","To solve this problem, we first need to find all the factors of 210. Since 210 is a composite number, it has factors other than 1 and itself.

1. Find factors of 210 by prime factorization:
   Prime factors of 210 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.
   Since 210 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7, the factors of 210 are:
   (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, 210)

2. Find the squares of all factors:
   (1^2 = 1, 2^2 = 4, 3^2 = 9, 5^2 = 25, 6^2 = 36, 7^2 = 49, 10^2 = 100, 14^2 = 196, 15^2 = 225, 21^2 = 441, 30^2 = 900, 35^2 = 1225, 42^2 = 1764, 70^2 = 4900, 105^2 = 10225, 210^2 = 44100)

3. Find the sum of the squares of all factors:
   (1 + 4 + 9 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 100 + 196 + 225 + 441 + 900 + 1225 + 1764 + 4900 + 10225 + 44100 = 111665)

So, the sum of the squares of all factors of 210 is 11165."

Basing this judgment on China's century of humiliation beginning in the early 19th century, American support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War, and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries, the Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States' crusade against Communism.

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy shrank by 20.4% in the period from April to June, marking the largest quarterly decline in the country's history."

This means that backslashes (`\`) in the string are treated literally, not as escape characters.

So, if you want to match a literal period (`.`), you can do it like this:

```python
import re

pattern = r'\.'
match = re.search(pattern, 'example.com')
if match:
    print('Found a dot!')
```

In the above example, the `r` before the string `'\.'` tells Python to treat the backslash as a literal backslash, not as an escape character. So, the period (`.`) is matched as is, not as a special character with a different meaning in the regex."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that despite some people claiming that Donald Trump has not achieved much in his first year as president, he has actually broken a record by playing golf more than any other president, which suggests a lack of focus on his duties. Kimmel then encouraged viewers to sign up for health insurance during the Affordable Care Act's open enrollment period, as the Trump administration is making efforts to undermine the plan but is instead seeing a surge in enrollment. Kimmel also highlighted the benefits of the new health care plan, such as covering pre-existing conditions, having no lifetime caps, and being affordable for those earning under $50,000. He urged viewers to keep an open mind and consider signing up for health insurance if they do not have it already."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

Nestled amidst the concrete jungle, the Japanese Garden of Portland, Oregon, is a sanctuary for the soul, a haven where one can find solace and peace amidst the chaos of city life.

The garden, a labor of love by the late Takao Suzuki, is a testament to the beauty and harmony of Japanese culture, a delicate balance of nature and artistry that transcends time and space. As one enters the garden, the cacophony of the city fades away, replaced by the gentle sound of trickling water and the rustling of leaves.

The garden is a symphony of colors, with vibrant azaleas and cherry blossoms painting the landscape in a riot of color during the spring, while the autumn leaves create a breathtaking tapestry of reds, oranges, and yellows in the fall. The garden is a living work of art, with intricate stone lanterns, sculptures, and bridges that add to its enchanting allure.

The garden is not just a visual feast, but also a sensory experience, with the fragrant scent of blooming flowers filling the air, and the sound of water flowing through the koi pond and waterfall creating a soothing ambiance. The garden is a place where one can find peace and tranquility, a sanctuary where one can escape the stresses of everyday life and find solace in the beauty of nature.

The Japanese Garden of Portland is a hidden gem, a sanctuary in the heart of the city that offers a glimpse into the beauty and harmony of Japanese culture.

Each widget has a different combination of size, color, and material, and I need your help to figure out which widget fits each category. Here's a table with the available widgets and their specifications:

2. The blue widget is made of metal.
3. The green widget is not the smallest or the largest.
4. The black widget is made of glass.
5. Widget A is not blue.
Can you provide a JSON data list of these widgets and their specifications based on your categorization? Good luck!","Based on the clues provided, here's the categorized JSON data list of the widgets:

    ""Size (inches)"": 8,
    ""Color"": ""Black"",
    ""Material"": ""Glass""
  }
]
```

Explanation:

1. The widget with a size of 3 inches is made of plastic. So, Widget A fits this category.
2. The blue widget is made of metal. Since Widget A is not blue, it cannot be this category.
3. The green widget is not the smallest or the largest. So, Widget C fits this category.
4. The black widget is made of glass. Since Widget A is not blue, it cannot be this category.
5. Widget A is not blue. So, it cannot be the blue widget made of metal.

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:
****
[A]: sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period

Climate change is caused by human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which increase greenhouse gas emissions and trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere. This leads to rising temperatures, melting ice caps and glaciers, and changes in weather patterns that can have devastating effects on ecosystems, agriculture, and human communities around the world. It is a complex and urgent issue that requires global cooperation and action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and adapt to the changes that are already underway."

Additionally, the model should be trained on a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and languages to ensure its robustness and generalizability.","To develop a sentiment analysis model, we can follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a large and diverse dataset of textual content from various sources such as social media platforms, customer reviews, news articles, and forums. The dataset should be balanced between positive and negative sentiments.

2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data by removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters. Normalize the text by converting it to lowercase and stemming or lemmatizing it.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from the preprocessed text using techniques such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or Word2Vec.

4. **Model Selection**: Choose a suitable machine learning or deep learning model for sentiment analysis. Some popular choices include Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

5. **Training**: Train the selected model on the preprocessed dataset, using techniques such as cross-validation, grid search, or early stopping to optimize hyperparameters.

6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

7. **Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters, adding more data, or using transfer learning to improve its performance.

8. **Deployment**: Deploy the fine-tuned model as a web service or integrate it into an application to analyze new textual content in real-time.

9. **Monitoring and Updating**: Continuously monitor the model's performance and update it with new data as needed to maintain its accuracy and generalizability.

10. **Language Translation**: To make the model more versatile, consider implementing language translation capabilities to analyze text in multiple languages.

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string for sharing via a URL, you can use Base64 encoding and decoding. Here's a simple example using JavaScript:

```javascript
// Encoding
function encodeBase64(str) {
    return btoa(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, str.split('').map(function(c) {
        return c.charCodeAt(0);
    }))).join('-'));
}

// Decoding
function decodeBase64(str) {
    return str.split('-').map(function(c) {
        return String.fromCharCode(parseInt(c, 36));
    }).join('');
}

// Usage
let longString = ""your_long_string_here"";
let encodedString = encodeBase64(longString);
console.log(encodedString); // Output: your_encoded_string_here

let decodedString = decodeBase64(encodedString);
console.log(decodedString); // Output: your_long_string_here
```

This code uses Base64 encoding and decoding functions to convert your long string into a shorter, shareable string. The encoded string can be easily shared via a URL, and the receiver can decode it back to the original long string."

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.

1. Add all ingredients except for soda water to a cocktail shaker. This includes gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water. For a mild and not overpowering flavor, use bartender-approved Noirot from France.

2. Shake the mixture vigorously for two minutes without ice. This helps to create a good foam and bloom.

3. Add a small amount of ice (around 3 small cubes) to the shaker and shake until the drink is well-chilled or the ice has melted.

1. **Quality Management System (QMS) Certification**: The supplier should have a certified QMS, such as ISO 9001, which demonstrates their commitment to quality, continuous improvement, and adherence to international standards.

2. **Technical Capability**: The supplier should have the necessary technical expertise, equipment, and facilities to produce the required products or services. This may include certifications specific to the industry or product.

3. **Financial Stability**: The supplier should demonstrate financial stability, with a solid track record of profitability and a healthy balance sheet.

4. **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Practices**: The supplier should adhere to ethical and sustainable business practices, including respect for human rights, labor standards, environmental protection, and transparency.

5. **Performance History**: The supplier should have a history of delivering products or services on time, to specification, and with a high level of quality. This may be evidenced by customer testimonials, case studies, or references.

6. **Innovation and Continuous Improvement**: The supplier should demonstrate a commitment to innovation and continuous improvement, with a track record of implementing new technologies, processes, or services.

7. **Risk Management**: The supplier should have robust risk management processes in place to mitigate potential risks, such as supply chain disruptions, quality issues, or financial difficulties.

8. **Collaboration and Communication**: The supplier should be willing and able to collaborate and communicate effectively with the EASA and other stakeholders, including sharing information, addressing concerns, and working towards mutual goals."

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.
Congham Hall Hotel Room rates start from £135 per night, room only, and £219 per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. Tel: 01485 600250.
Congham Hall is in Grimston village, just off the A148, six miles north-east of King’s Lynn, which is 110 minutes by train from London King’s Cross. Norwich Airport is 45 minutes away by road and there is also a helipad on site.","Congham Hall Hotel stands out from other hotels in the area with its charming ambiance and unique dining options. The hotel is nestled in a secluded location in North-West Norfolk, near the Queen's Sandringham estate, and offers a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of the outside world. The hotel's Georgian mansion, which dates back to the 1800s, has been tastefully renovated to offer 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at different price points, as well as a luxury spa.

Yes, there can be regional variations in the flight patterns of Tabanus, commonly known as horse flies. These variations can be influenced by factors such as climate, geography, and the presence of host animals.

For example, in temperate regions, horse flies are typically active during the warmer months, while in tropical regions, they may be active year-round. In mountainous regions, they may be found at higher elevations during the summer months when temperatures are warmer.

Additionally, the presence of suitable host animals can also affect the distribution and flight patterns of horse flies. For example, in regions with large populations of horses or cattle, horse flies may be more common in those areas compared to regions with fewer of these animals.

Overall, the flight patterns of horse flies can provide valuable information about the local environment and the presence of suitable host animals."

Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
