Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. **Energy Efficiency**: Incorporate energy-efficient building designs, such as passive solar design, proper insulation, and energy-efficient windows. Use high-performance HVAC systems and appliances that meet or exceed energy efficiency standards.

2. **Renewable Energy**: Integrate renewable energy sources like solar panels, wind turbines, or geothermal systems to reduce reliance on non-renewable energy sources. Consider community solar projects to share the benefits of renewable energy.

3. **Water Conservation**: Implement water-saving measures such as low-flow fixtures, rainwater harvesting systems, and greywater recycling systems. Design landscapes that require minimal irrigation and use native, drought-resistant plants.

4. **Sustainable Materials**: Use sustainable and locally sourced building materials to reduce the carbon footprint associated with transportation and manufacturing. Consider recycled, reclaimed, or rapidly renewable materials.

5. **Green Spaces**: Include green spaces such as parks, community gardens, and green roofs to improve air quality, provide recreational areas, and enhance biodiversity. These spaces can also help manage stormwater runoff.

6. **Transportation**: Design developments to promote walking, cycling, and public transportation. Provide bike lanes, sidewalks, and accessible public transit options to reduce reliance on personal vehicles.

7. **Waste Management**: Implement waste reduction, reuse, and recycling programs. Design buildings and common areas to facilitate easy recycling and composting.

8. **Smart Home Technology**: Incorporate smart home technology to optimize energy use, water consumption, and waste management. This can include automated lighting, temperature control, and appliance management systems.

9. **Community Engagement**: Involve residents in the planning and decision-making process to ensure that sustainability goals are met and that the community supports the initiatives. This can lead to greater buy-in and long-term success.

10. **Regulatory Compliance and Certifications**: Adhere to local, state, and national sustainability regulations and seek certifications such as LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), Passive House, or BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method).

11. **Resilience Planning**: Design developments to be resilient to climate change impacts such as extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and heatwaves. This can include features like elevated building foundations, green infrastructure, and robust emergency preparedness plans.

By integrating these strategies, housing developments can become more sustainable,"

When you encounter a 404 error while running `docker-compose up`, it could be due to several reasons. Here are some common causes and troubleshooting steps:

1. **Incorrect Service Name**:
   - Ensure that the service name you are trying to start exists in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - Example: If you are trying to start a service named `web`, make sure it is defined in your `docker-compose.yml`.

2. **Incorrect Command**:
   - Double-check the command you are using. The correct command is `docker-compose up` (without any service name) to start all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - If you want to start a specific service, use `docker-compose up <service-name>`.

3. **Missing or Incorrect Configuration**:
   - Ensure that your `docker-compose.yml` file is correctly configured.
   - Check for any typos or missing services.
   - Verify that the service definitions are correct and that all required dependencies are present.

4. **Network Issues**:
   - Ensure that the network configuration in your `docker-compose.yml` is correct.
   - Check if the service is properly exposed and accessible.

5. **Build Issues**:
   - If you have a `dockerfile` in your project, ensure that the build process is successful.
   - Check for any build errors or warnings.

6. **Volume or Data Persistence Issues**:
   - If you are using volumes or data persistence, ensure that the paths are correct and accessible.

7. **Logs and Debugging**:
   - Check the logs for more detailed information about the error. Use `docker-compose logs <service-name>` to view logs for a specific service.
   - Use `docker-compose up --build` to rebuild the containers and see if that resolves the issue.

8. **Permissions**:
   - Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to run Docker commands.

Here is an example of a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - ""80:80""

This metaphor conveys the author's emotional state of feeling isolated, damaged, and difficult to approach. The author is likely experiencing a sense of frustration, disillusionment, and perhaps even anger or sadness about their current situation or circumstances. The use of ""ruined"" suggests a sense of loss or damage, while ""inaccessible"" implies a feeling of being cut off or unable to connect with others or the world around them."

Here are some guidelines to help you determine the appropriate number of plants:

1. **Space Size**: Measure the square footage of your closet office. A general rule of thumb is to have one large plant or three small plants for every 100 square feet.

2. **Types of Plants**: Some plants are more effective at removing certain pollutants. Common air-purifying plants include:
   - **Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)**
   - **Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)**
   - **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)**
   - **Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica)**
   - **Boston Fern (Nephrolepis exaltata)**
   - **Areca Palm (Dypsis lutescens)**
   - **Dracaena (Dracaena spp.)**

3. **Lighting**: Consider the amount of natural light your closet office receives. Plants that thrive in low light conditions, such as the Snake Plant and Peace Lily, are ideal for darker spaces.

4. **Air Quality Concerns**: If you have specific air quality concerns, such as formaldehyde or benzene, certain plants are better suited to address these. For example, the Spider Plant and Peace Lily are effective at removing formaldehyde, while the Snake Plant is good for benzene.

### Example Calculation:
- If your closet office is 100 square feet, you would need 1 large plant or 3 small plants.
- If it's 200 square feet, you would need 2 large plants or 6 small plants.

### Additional Tips:
- **Air Purifiers**: While plants can help, they are not as effective as air purifiers for removing certain pollutants. Consider using an air purifier in addition to plants.
- **Maintenance**: Ensure you can properly care for the plants you choose. Some plants require more attention than others.

By considering these factors, you can determine the appropriate number of plants to improve the air quality in your closet office."

Moreover, could you share a Ruby script capable of producing a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table?","To create a comprehensive comparison chart in HTML table format between traditional education and online education, taking into account the aspects of cost, flexibility, interaction, resources, and learning outcomes, using Ruby code, you can follow these steps:
1. Create an HTML table with the required columns and rows.
2. Use Ruby to populate the table with the relevant information.
Here's an example Ruby script that creates an HTML table and populates it with the required information:
```ruby
# Define the table headers
headers = [""Aspect"", ""Traditional Education"", ""Online Education""]
# Define the table rows
rows = [
  [""Cost"", ""Higher"", ""Lower""],
  [""Flexibility"", ""Less"", ""More""],
  [""Interaction"", ""In-person"", ""Virtual""],
  [""Resources"", ""Limited"", ""Abundant""],
  [""Learning Outcomes"", ""Varies"", ""Varies""]
]
# Create the HTML table
html_table = ""<table>""
html_table += ""<tr>""
headers.each do |header|
  html_table += ""<th>#{header}</th>""
end
html_table += ""</tr>""
rows.each do |row|
  html_table += ""<tr>""
  row.each do |cell|
    html_table += ""<td>#{cell}</td>""
  end
  html_table += ""</tr>""
end
html_table += ""</table>""
# Output the HTML table
puts html_table
```
To create a bar graph that compares the two education models based on the information presented in the table, you can use a Ruby gem like `gruff`. Here's an example Ruby script that creates a bar graph using `gruff`:
```ruby
require 'gruff'
# Define the data for the bar graph
data = {
  ""Traditional Education"" => [2, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  ""Online Education"" => [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
}
# Create a new bar graph
graph = Gruff::Bar.new
# Set the title and labels for the graph
graph.title = ""Comparison of Traditional and Online Education""
graph.labels = {0 => ""Cost"", 1 => ""Flexibility"", 2 => ""Interaction"", 3 => ""Resources"", 4 => ""Learning Outcomes""}
# Add the data to the graph
data.each do |name, values|
  graph.data(name, values)
end
# Save the graph as"

20. What's is the sum of the squares of all factors of 210?","To find the sum of the squares of all factors of 210, we first need to determine its prime factorization and then use properties of divisors and their squares.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 210
\[ 210 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \]

### Step 2: List All Factors of 210
The factors of 210 can be generated from its prime factorization. The factors are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, 210 \]

### Step 3: Sum of the Squares of the Factors
To find the sum of the squares of all factors, we can use the property that if \( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} \), then the sum of the squares of the divisors of \( n \) is given by:
\[ \sigma_2(n) = (1 + p_1^2 + p_1^4 + \cdots + p_1^{2e_1})(1 + p_2^2 + p_2^4 + \cdots + p_2^{2e_2}) \cdots (1 + p_k^2 + p_k^4 + \cdots + p_k^{2e_k}) \]

For \( n = 210 = 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 \), we have:
\[ \sigma_2(210) = (1 + 2^2)(1 + 3^2)(1 + 5^2)(1 + 7^2) \]

### Step 4: Calculate Each Term
\[ 1 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 \]
\[ 1 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10 \]
\[ 1 + 5^2 = 1 + 25 = 26 \]
\[ 1 + 7^2 = 1 +"

Here's how you can set it up:

### 1. **Edit the sudoers File**
   The `sudoers` file controls who can run what commands as what users. You should always edit this file with the `visudo` command to avoid syntax errors that could prevent sudo from working at all.

   ```bash
   sudo visudo
   ```

### 2. **Add the User to the `sudo` Group (Optional)**
   If you want to allow a user to run all commands without a password, you can add them to the `sudo` group. This is not necessary if you are configuring a specific user or command.

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG sudo username
   ```

### 3. **Configure Passwordless Sudo for a Specific User and Command**
   You can configure sudo to allow a specific user to run a specific command without a password. For example, to allow the user `username` to run the `apt-get update` command without a password:

   ```bash
   username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get update
   ```

   If you want to allow the user to run any command without a password, you can use:

   ```bash
   username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

### 4. **Verify the Configuration**
   After making changes, save the file and exit the editor. You can test the configuration by running a sudo command as the user:

   ```bash
   sudo -l -U username
   ```

   This will list the commands that the user can run without a password.

### 5. **Security Considerations**
   - **Limit the Scope**: Only grant passwordless sudo access for necessary commands and users.
   - **Use Specific Commands**: Instead of `ALL`, specify the exact commands that should be run without a password.
   - **Regular Audits**: Regularly review and update the `sudoers` file to ensure it remains secure.

### Example of a Full `sudoers` Entry
Here's an example of a full `sudoers` entry that allows the user `username` to run any command without a password:

```bash
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```"

Lastly, submission with ['id', 'label]. Label consists 0 to 7, and the text column consists of news article data. Write some codes about augmentation, then, classifies via keras with other models ensembled. Validation must be f1 macro.","Sure, let's break down the task into several steps:

1. **Data Augmentation**: We can use techniques like text transformation (e.g., synonym replacement, back translation) to augment the training dataset.
2. **Model Training**: We will train multiple models using Keras and ensemble their predictions.
3. **Validation**: We will use F1 macro as the validation metric.

Here's a step-by-step implementation:

### Step 1: Data Augmentation

We can use the `transformers` library for text augmentation. Specifically, we can use the `BackTranslation` method from `textattack` or `transformers`.

```python
from textattack.augmentation import BackTranslationAugmenter
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification, pipeline

# Initialize the augmenter
augmenter = BackTranslationAugmenter()

# Load tokenizer and model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(""bert-base-uncased"")
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(""bert-base-uncased"")

# Function to augment the dataset
def augment_data(df, augmenter, tokenizer, max_length=128):
    augmented_texts = []
    for text in df['text']:
        augmented_texts.extend(augmenter.augment(text))
    
    # Tokenize the augmented texts
    inputs = tokenizer(augmented_texts, padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=max_length, return_tensors=""pt"")
    return inputs

# Example usage
train_df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
augmented_inputs = augment_data(train_df, augmenter, tokenizer)
```

### Step 2: Model Training and Ensemble

We will train multiple models using different architectures and ensemble their predictions.

```python

from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
from transformers import TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification, DataCollatorWithPadding, Trainer, TrainingArguments

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.

The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: ""By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. ""Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery. That likely means no new pressures on business and ongoing support for firms still facing trade restrictions.""
Output:","The UK economy contracted by 20.4% in April, May, and June due to the coronavirus lockdown, performing worse than other major industrial nations, with Scotland experiencing a 19.4% decline."

Here are some examples to illustrate this:

1. **Literal `=`**:
   - If you want to match the literal `=` character, you do not need to escape it:
     ```python
     import re

     pattern = r'='
     text = 'a=b=c'
     matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
     print(matches)  # Output: ['=', '=']
     ```

2. **Special Characters**:
   - If `=` is part of a special regex pattern, you might need to escape it depending on the context. For example, `*=` is a special pattern that matches `*` followed by an `=`:
     ```python
     import re

     pattern = r'\*='  # Escaping the * to match the literal * character
     text = 'a*b=c'
     matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
     print(matches)  # Output: []
     ```

3. **Word Boundaries**:
   - If you are using `=` in a context like a word boundary, you would need to escape it:
     ```python
     import re

     pattern = r'\b=\b'  # Escaping the = to match the literal = character
     text = 'a=b c=d'
     matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
     print(matches)  # Output: []
     ```

In summary, you only need to escape the `=` symbol if it is part of a special regex pattern or if you are using it in a context where it might be interpreted as a special character. For matching the literal `=` character, you do not need to escape it."

Passage: Jimmy Kimmel noted that Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump winning the presidential election.
“Isn’t it crazy to think we’re already 80% of the way through this presidency?” Kimmel marveled.
The ABC late-night host called it unfair that a lot of people say Trump hasn’t accomplished anything. In this one year, he has played golf more than 70 times, which is a presidential record, Kimmel revealed.
He instead suggested those people do something positive, like sign up during the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period that’s happening now. Trump’s White House isn’t even trying to conceal efforts to undermine the plan, including discouraging enrollment. But, as WaPo recently noted, it’s backfiring and sign-up has surged.
“I have spoken a lot about healthcare on this show, and been critical of what Trump and half of Congress is trying to do,” Kimmel began.
“Enrollment just started on the new health care plan, and it actually has a lot of good stuff in it. It covers pre-existing conditions, it has no lifetime caps, you can keep your kids on it, and it’s also surprisingly affordable, especially for people making under $50,000. So, even if you don’t support President Trump, watch this, keep an open mind, and if you don’t have health insurance go to the website and sign up,” Kimmel said, directing viewers to Healthcare.gov.","Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that Donald Trump has broken a presidential record by playing golf more than 70 times during his first year in office. Kimmel used this fact to highlight his critique of Trump's accomplishments, suggesting that while many people claim Trump hasn't achieved anything significant, he has spent a considerable amount of time on leisure activities like golf rather than focusing on policy-making and governance. Kimmel's statement implies that Trump's priorities may not align with the public's expectations for a president's time in office."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating.

It is a quaint little park nestled in the heart of a bustling city, surrounded by towering skyscrapers and busy streets. Despite its proximity to the urban chaos, this park is a peaceful oasis, a sanctuary where nature and humanity coexist in perfect harmony.

As I step into the park, the first thing that strikes me is the sound of birds chirping and leaves rustling in the gentle breeze. The air is fresh and clean, and the scent of blooming flowers fills my nostrils. The park is lush and green, with tall trees providing shade and a canopy of leaves filtering the sunlight. The grass is soft and inviting, and I can feel the warmth of the sun on my skin as I walk along the winding paths.

One of the most beautiful features of this park is the pond in the center. The water is crystal clear, and the fish swim gracefully beneath the surface. Ducks and geese paddle around the edges, and the occasional heron can be seen standing motionless, waiting for its next meal. The pond is surrounded by a ring of benches, where people sit and relax, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere.

But what truly makes this park special is the community that has grown up around it. People of all ages and backgrounds come to the park to enjoy its beauty and serenity. Children play on the swings and slides, while parents watch over them with smiles on their faces. Seniors sit on the benches, chatting and laughing, while young couples walk hand in hand, lost in each other's company. The park has become a place where people from all walks of life can come together and connect with one another.

As I sit on one of the benches, watching the world go by, I feel a sense of contentment wash over me. This park is more than just a place to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. It is a place where I can find peace, joy, and a sense of belonging. It is a place that makes me happy, and I am grateful for its existence."

7ae3742443c1115cf3fcbddbd6a36892f60b89fcdad86d2b9ead5286580a3902,List the reason why sail is made up of invisible air.,"Sails are not made up of invisible air. Sails are typically made of materials such as canvas, nylon, or polyester, which are visible and tangible. However, the force that propels a sailboat is generated by the wind, which is a flow of air molecules moving from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure. The wind itself is not visible, but its effects can be seen and felt as it moves the sail and causes the boat to move.

If you are looking for reasons why a sail might seem to be ""invisible"" or why the air itself is not visible, here are a few points:

1. **Sail Material**: The sail is made of a visible material, but the air passing over it is not visible.
2. **Wind Visibility**: The wind itself is not visible; you can only see its effects, such as the movement of the sail.
3. **Light Interaction**: The sail reflects or absorbs light, making it visible, while the air passing over it does not interact with light in a way that makes it visible to the naked eye.
4. **Visual Perception**: The movement of the sail and the resulting motion of the boat are what we perceive as the effect of the wind, not the wind itself.

If you have a different context or specific scenario in mind, please provide more details so I can give a more accurate answer."

Context: ""Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see ver sacrum), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The ""contract"" with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan's death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.""  Answer:

I want to be able to encode this string into a short string so it's easily shareable via a url and then decode the shared string,"To encode and decode a long string into a short, shareable string in JavaScript, you can use various encoding techniques such as Base64 or URL-safe Base64. Base64 encoding is a common method to encode binary data to an ASCII string format. However, Base64 can sometimes result in longer strings due to the nature of the encoding. To make it more compact and URL-safe, you can use URL-safe Base64 encoding, which replaces the '+' and '/' characters with '-' and '_'.

Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. **Install a URL-safe Base64 library**: You can use the `btoa` and `atob` functions for Base64 encoding and decoding, but for URL-safe encoding, you might need a library like `base-64`.

2. **Encode and decode the string**.

Below is a complete example using the `base-64` library:

First, install the `base-64` library using npm:

```sh
npm install base-64
```

Then, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const base64 = require('base-64');

// Function to encode a string to a URL-safe Base64 string
function encodeStringToUrlSafeBase64(input) {
    return base64.encode(input).replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_').replace(/=/g, '');
}

// Function to decode a URL-safe Base64 string to the original string
function decodeUrlSafeBase64ToOriginal(input) {
    return base64.decode(input.replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/'));
}

// Example usage
const originalString = ""This is a very long string that needs to be encoded and shared via a URL."";
const encodedString = encodeStringToUrlSafeBase64(originalString);
console.log(""Encoded String:"", encodedString);

const decodedString = decodeUrlSafeBase64ToOriginal(encodedString);
console.log(""Decoded String:"", decodedString);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Encoding**:
   - The `encodeStringToUrlSafeBase64` function takes the original string, encodes it to Base64, and then replaces the '+' and '/' characters with '-' and '_', respectively. It also removes any trailing '=' characters.
   
2. **Decoding**:
   - The `decodeUrlSafeBase64"

In this world, PacMan is located at (1,1) and the goal node is at (3,3). We want to use Heuristic search to find the optimal path for PacMan to reach the goal node.
Assuming that the cost of moving from one cell to an adjacent cell is 1, and that PacMan can only move up, down, left, or right, what would be the optimal path for PacMan to take to reach the goal node? Please provide the path as a sequence of coordinates.","To find the optimal path for Pac-Man to reach the goal node using a heuristic search algorithm, we can use the A* search algorithm. A* search uses a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal, which in this case is the Manhattan distance (also known as taxicab or city block distance).

The heuristic function \( h(n) \) for a node \( n \) is the Manhattan distance from the current node to the goal node. The cost function \( f(n) \) is the sum of the cost from the start node to the current node \( g(n) \) and the heuristic \( h(n) \).

Let's apply A* search to find the optimal path:

1. **Start Node**: (1,1)
2. **Goal Node**: (3,3)

### Step-by-Step A* Search

1. **Initialize the open list** with the start node (1,1) and the closed list as empty.
2. **Calculate the heuristic** for the start node:
   \[
   h(1,1) = |1-3| + |1-3| = 4
   \]
   So, \( f(1,1) = g(1,1) + h(1,1) = 0 + 4 = 4 \).

3. **Expand the start node** (1,1):
   - Possible moves: (1,2), (2,1)
   - Calculate the heuristic for each move:
     - \( h(1,2) = |1-3| + |2-3| = 3 \)
     - \( h(2,1) = |2-3| + |1-3| = 3 \)
   - Add these nodes to the open list with their \( f \) values:
     - \( f(1,2) = 1 + 3 = 4 \)
     - \( f(2,1) = 1 + 3 = 4 \)

4. **Choose the node with the lowest \( f \) value** from the open list. Both (1,2) and (2,1) have the same \( f \) value of 4. We can choose either one. Let's choose (1,2).

5. **Expand (1,2)**:
   - Possible moves: (1,3), (2,"

The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.
6. Wipe the sweat from your brow and drink. You earned it.
How do you make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz, and what are some tips for achieving the ideal foam and bloom on the drink?","To make a perfect Ramos Gin Fizz and achieve the ideal foam and bloom, follow these steps and tips:

### Ingredients:
- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz egg white
- 1 oz lemon juice
- 1 oz lime juice
- 1 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz orange flower water
- 1 oz cream
- Soda water (Topo Chico recommended)
- Ice cubes (small, about 3)

### Equipment:
- Cocktail shaker
- Collins glass

### Instructions:

1. **Dry Shake:**
   - Add gin, egg white, lemon juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your cocktail shaker.
   - Shake vigorously without adding ice for about 2 minutes. This helps emulsify the egg white and mix the ingredients thoroughly. The vigorous shaking also helps create a stable foam.

2. **Add Ice and Shake Again:**
   - Add 3 small ice cubes to the shaker.
   - Shake again until the mixture is well-chilled or until the ice has mostly melted. This ensures the drink is cold and the ingredients are fully combined.

3. **Strain and Serve:**
   - Pour soda water into a Collins glass first.
   - Strain the cocktail over the soda water.
   - The meringue should separate from the liquid, and the foam should rise to the top.

### Tips for Achieving the Ideal Foam and Bloom:

1. **Vigorous Dry Shake:**
   - The key to a good foam is a vigorous dry shake. This helps create a stable emulsion with the egg white, which is crucial for the foam.

2. **Proper Ice:**
   - Use small ice cubes. Smaller ice cubes melt faster, which helps in achieving a finer, more delicate foam.

3. **Timing:**
   - The ideal shaking time can vary, but a good starting point is 2 minutes. Adjust based on your preference and the strength of your shaker.

4. **Consistency:**
   - Practice makes perfect. The more you shake, the better you'll get at achieving the right consistency and foam.

5. **Ingredients Quality:**
   - Use high-quality ingredients, especially the egg white and orange flower water. Noirot from France is a good choice for its mild and not overpowering flavor.

6. **Glass Choice:**
   - Use a Collins glass for serving"

This process ensures that suppliers meet the necessary quality and safety standards to produce components, systems, or other items that will be used in aircraft or aviation systems. Here’s a general overview of how EASA evaluates suppliers:

1. **Initial Application and Documentation:**
   - Suppliers must submit an application to the production organization (PO) that intends to use their products.
   - The application should include detailed documentation about the supplier's quality management system, production processes, and any relevant certifications or approvals.

2. **Supplier Approval Process:**
   - The PO will review the supplier’s documentation and may conduct an initial assessment to determine if the supplier meets the basic requirements.
   - If the initial assessment is positive, the PO will proceed with a more detailed evaluation.

3. **On-Site Audits:**
   - EASA may conduct on-site audits to verify that the supplier’s quality management system and production processes comply with EASA regulations and standards.
   - These audits may include reviews of the supplier’s facilities, documentation, and production processes.

4. **Quality Management System (QMS):**
   - The supplier must demonstrate that their QMS is effective and compliant with EASA’s requirements.
   - This includes having documented procedures, regular internal audits, and corrective actions for any identified issues.

5. **Production Processes:**
   - EASA evaluates the supplier’s production processes to ensure they are capable of producing components or systems that meet the required quality and safety standards.
   - This may involve reviewing production equipment, tooling, and any special processes used.

6. **Testing and Inspection:**
   - The supplier must demonstrate that they have the necessary testing and inspection capabilities to ensure the quality of their products.
   - EASA may require the supplier to provide test results or conduct their own tests to verify compliance.

7. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Once a supplier is approved, EASA and the PO may conduct periodic audits and inspections to ensure ongoing compliance.
   - The supplier must maintain their QMS and production processes to meet the required standards.

8. **Non-Conformances and Corrective Actions:**
   - If any non-conformances are identified during the evaluation or ongoing monitoring, the supplier must take corrective actions to address the issues.
   - EASA and the PO will monitor the effectiveness of these corrective actions.

Generate according to: A waitress inquired with a smile if the cooler summer weather was more to our liking as she placed platefuls of succulent oak-smoked kippers with pots of mustard sauce on the table.
We might have been in one of those rambling Georgian hotels you find in the sparsely populated rural beauty of Connemara or Galway, where true peace is as guaranteed as a golden glass of fine single malt.
But no. We were not in the west of Ireland. This was a special place in that hidden gem of England, the Royal coast of North-West Norfolk, a diamond tiara’s throw from the Queen’s Sandringham estate and somewhere that has retained a real sense of charm and tradition.
As soon as we had first headed into the discreetly signposted Congham Hall Hotel driveway and past the mature trees and manicured lawn, it was clear that this was an escape from a hectic outside world.
Inside the Georgian mansion we were met with a friendly welcome as my partner and photographer, Sue Mountjoy, and I were shown to our spacious first-floor room.
Its sash windows looked out onto a scene little altered since the Everards, a wealthy merchant family, had first moved in around two centuries ago in ‘Upstairs Downstairs’ style with five servants.
Since then, the best has been kept but much has also been improved in and around the building, which became a hotel in the early 1980s and now boasts 26 stylish and varied bedrooms at a range of price points, as well as a luxury spa.
Every hotel has a certain ‘feel’ and this was very different: while walking in the grounds, we saw spa staff laughing together; breakfast waitresses sharing jokes as they cleared tables; two smiling old ladies who regularly choose the place for a stylish breakaway and ‘young mums’ chatting in the spa hot tub.
Sue and I were spending two nights there to absorb the tranquillity and to sample the 2AA Rosettes food, headed up by executive chef James O’Connor, whose portfolio includes stints at London’s Claridges and Longueville Manor on Jersey.
But we also aimed to savour a tour of the nearby coast, stately homes, quaint villages and ‘Six of the Best,’ a themed tour of Norfolk Art Experiences devised by the hotel for culture lovers.
First up though after our arrival, was dinner served in the spacious orangery-style dining room as the sun sank on a quintessentially English rural scene.
The atmosphere, once again, is that relaxed feel of and the food has some delightful twists on fish, meat and vegetarian, with most of the ingredients sourced from within 20 miles of an area noted for some of the best game-hunting and meat suppliers in the region, including rare-breed pork, venison from Holkham, Cromer crab and oysters from nearby Brancaster.
After that there was time to check out the sumptuous recent refurbishments as well as the calming sitting rooms. Shortly, we were off for a waterfall showering (next night was a long soak in the free-standing bath) followed by a dreamy night’s sleep beneath sumptuous Egyptian cotton on the comfiest of beds.
Next morning, we woke up with a caffeine infusion from the bedroom’s Nespresso machine and enjoyed a pre-breakfast walk in the grounds. There are plenty of rambles among the 30 acres and a wander in the long-established vegetable, fruit and herb gardens is encouraged.
Breakfast can be a sumptuous affair if you start with a muesli and fruit buffet opener that quickly becomes a work of art followed by the taste-exploding Full English or the much wiser Spa Breakfast.
Feeling guilty after all that? You could try the tennis court, croquet, trampoline or the Secret Garden Spa, which has a swimming pool open to adults, as well as children at various times, a hot tub and stacks of treatments and therapies. In our case it was just a quick 9-hole pitch and putt before we headed out on our local tour of art galleries following the ‘Six of the Best’ itinerary.
When we finally left Congham – after another exquisite dinner, the deepest of sleeps and a sun-kissed terrace breakfast – it felt as if we were parting from friends at a much-loved country house. Chilled? Most definitely! Zzzzzzzz.

These differences can be influenced by various factors, including climate, availability of hosts, and local ecosystems. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Climate and Seasonality**: In regions with distinct seasons, Tabanus species may have different flight patterns. For example, they might be more active during warmer months and less active during colder periods. Some species may migrate to warmer areas during winter months.

2. **Host Availability**: The abundance and distribution of potential hosts (such as horses, cattle, and other animals) can influence flight patterns. In areas with a high density of hosts, Tabanus may be more concentrated in those regions, leading to different flight patterns compared to areas with fewer hosts.

3. **Elevation and Topography**: In mountainous regions, Tabanus species may exhibit different flight patterns based on elevation. For instance, some species may be more common at lower elevations where temperatures are warmer, while others may be more prevalent at higher elevations.

4. **Vegetation and Habitat**: The type of vegetation and habitat can also affect flight patterns. For example, Tabanus species that prefer open grasslands may have different flight patterns compared to those that thrive in forests or wetlands.

5. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Some Tabanus species have evolved specific behaviors to cope with different environmental conditions. For example, some species may be more active during the day in some regions and more active at night in others.

While these differences exist, it's important to note that the overall flight patterns of Tabanus species are generally similar across different regions, with variations being more subtle and influenced by local environmental factors."

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How many kings did Hungary have before Joanna I of Naples father-in-law? Passage 1:Davies gained a PPE degree from Oxford University in 1974, and started his journalism career in 1976, working as a trainee for the Mirror Group in Plymouth. He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.
 Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.
 Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.
