In the heart of a world steeped in violence and conflict, a beacon of peace named Maya emerged. With a heart that burned with compassion and a spirit that refused to be subdued, she embarked on a journey to spread her message of tranquility.

Maya's days were filled with a symphony of conflicting emotions. The constant barrage of news depicting gruesome acts of violence left her heart shattered yet unwavering. The voices of innocent victims echoed in her mind, urging her to take action.

Her activism began with small acts of defiance, like organizing peaceful protests and dialogues between opposing factions. But the road to change was far from smooth. Threats, intimidation, and even physical violence loomed large, yet Maya refused to be cowed.

""We must break the cycle of violence,"" Maya declared, her voice resonating through the streets. ""It is not the answer to solve our problems.""

Her unwavering determination attracted allies from all walks of life. From activists to teachers to community leaders, they joined her crusade, spreading her message far and wide.

However, their efforts were met with fierce resistance from those who clung to the status quo. Adversaries hurled insults, threatened their lives, and accused them of being traitors. But Maya refused to be silenced.

""We are not fighting for ourselves,"" she clarified. ""We are fighting for a future where all voices are heard and valued.""

Despite the challenges, Maya's impact began to ripple through the community. Small acts of kindness, like acts of compassion and forgiveness, began to spread like wildfire. People started to question their own biases and seek understanding.

The transformation was gradual, but it was tangible. The hostility that once permeated the air began to dissipate, replaced by a newfound sense of empathy and respect.

Maya's journey was not without its sacrifices. The toll of witnessing human suffering took a heavy toll on her. Yet, she persevered, knowing that even small acts of change could have a profound impact.

In the end, Maya's unwavering dedication to peace yielded a tangible result. The community began to embrace a more peaceful way of resolving conflicts. The voices of hate and intolerance were replaced by the voices of understanding and compassion.

As the world began to breathe a sigh of relief, Maya stood amidst the ruins of the old order, her heart filled with gratitude. She knew that the journey toward peace was a long and arduous one, but she also knew that it was worth it.

Answer according to: Palisades, NY - Frank Cheney Platt, advocate for poetry, poets, literature and writers, dedicated husband and father, died on February 26, in Rockleigh, NJ. Following its founding in 1985, he helped to build Poets House, now headquartered in Battery Park City, into a national poetry library and literary center with a 70,000-volume collection. Frank loved poetry that ""communicate[s] before it is understood"" (T.S. Eliot) and captures what is ""lost in translation."" (Robert Frost). In addition, he was committed to arts and culture as a means of protecting and cultivating principles of free speech and an open society.
He was born in New York City on November 6, 1932 and raised by his father Roger Platt, a teacher at St. Bernard's School, his mother Frances Cheney, and his grandfather Frank Cheney Jr. of Manchester, CT. Frank was educated at St. Bernard's, Dalton, Eaglebrook, Governor's Academy (formerly Governor Dummer), and Harvard College. He worked in publishing before becoming president of the Farfield Foundation, and later an assistant Dean for Columbia's School of the Arts.
In 2013, Frank was predeceased by his wife of 55 years Judy van der Gracht. She was the love of his life. His poignant dedication to her (including during her time with Alzheimer's) inspired respect and admiration from all who knew them. Frank was also passionate about his extended family - the Platts, Cheneys and, on Judy's side of the family, the Gilberts and van der Grachts as well as his dozen godchildren. His many longstanding and deeply-felt friendships were legion. Most involved a common love of music, poetry, literature and epicurean delights, not necessarily in that order.
Frank is survived by his three children Sophie Platt Pollok of Frankfurt, Germany, Arthur van der Gracht Platt of New York, NY and Roger Platt of Washington, DC and his grandchildren Esther Pollok, Lucas Pollok, Hilary Platt, and Benjamin Platt. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Poets House (https://poetshouse.org) and/or One-to-One Learning (http://www.one2one-learning.org) A memorial service will be held at 11am on Saturday, March 16 at Grace Episcopal Church, 130 First Ave, Nyack, NY, with Father Richard Gressle presiding. His remains will be laid to rest with his beloved wife in the Cheney Cemetery in Manchester, CT. The burial ceremony will be private.","Dean for Columbia's School of the Arts.

The scent of fresh earth and honeysuckle lingered in the air, the sun warm on Elias' back as he sat beneath the willow tree, strumming a borrowed guitar. The instrument felt alien in his hand, but the music flowed through him, a melody born of the wind rustling leaves and the chirping of birds.

""That's quite a song, Elias,"" his friend, Maya, commented, her voice echoing through the park. Elias beamed, his eyes alight with passion. ""I'm calling it 'Willow's Song,'"" he announced, his voice raw yet surprisingly sweet.

From that day forward, the guitar became Elias' constant companion. He devoured lessons, practiced tirelessly, and filled notebooks with lyrics that mirrored his own experiences. His friends, initially bewildered by his newfound obsession, soon found themselves captivated by his music.

""Your songs are like stories, Elias,"" Maya said, her voice breaking. ""They paint a picture, make me feel things.""

But not everyone was so supportive. His family, steeped in tradition and practicality, questioned his pursuit of a dream that seemed impractical. His significant other, Emily, a painter whose creativity mirrored his own, struggled to understand his dedication to the guitar.

""You're neglecting your studies and your job,"" his father warned, his voice laced with concern. ""Is this really what you want, Elias?""

""I know I have to do this, Dad,"" Elias pleaded, his voice breaking. ""It's my passion, my escape. Please, just trust me.""

His relationship with Emily also faced challenges. ""I want to see you succeed, Elias, but I also want you to be happy,"" she said, her voice tinged with worry. ""Is this really what you want, even if it means sacrificing your relationship?""

Despite the obstacles, Elias persevered. He found solace in the act of creating music, and his passion fueled his determination. He started performing at local cafes and open mic nights, his confidence growing with each performance.

One evening, as he strummed beneath the same willow tree, Elias felt a sense of accomplishment. He had overcome the doubters and found his voice. The music flowed through him, a testament to his resilience and his unwavering spirit.

""This is it, Elias,"" Maya said, her eyes shining. ""You're a star.""

""The weight of the world, it feels, has shifted onto my shoulders. Not literally, of course, but metaphorically. Today, I stand at the precipice of a new chapter, a new journey, a new me.

It's a cocktail of emotions. Excitement, tinged with a hint of apprehension. Pride, tinged with a tinge of humility. Joy, tinged with a sprinkle of disbelief. And a profound sense of accomplishment, the culmination of years of toil and sacrifice.

This promotion isn't just a career milestone; it's a testament to the power of perseverance, the unwavering belief in my abilities, and the unwavering support of those who believed in me even when I doubted myself. It's a validation of the countless hours I've poured into my work, the late nights, the sacrifices made, all in pursuit of this dream.

But with this newfound power comes a new set of responsibilities. The burden of leadership, the weight of expectation, the responsibility to inspire and motivate others. I'm not just climbing the corporate ladder; I'm building a bridge, a pathway for others to ascend.

I'm looking forward to tackling new challenges, leading projects that once seemed insurmountable, and leaving my mark on the world, one accomplishment at a time. I'm also looking forward to seeing the growth and development of my colleagues, the team that has been instrumental in my journey.

This promotion isn't just about me. It's about the ripple effect it has on my relationships, my interactions, and the countless lives that I have the privilege to touch. I'm grateful for the opportunity to inspire, to lead, and to leave a positive impact on the world.

Generate according to: A counterweight at the end of the space elevator will keep the carbon-nanotubes ribbon taut.
To better understand the concept of a space elevator, think of the game tetherball in which a rope is attached at one end to a pole and at the other to a ball. In this analogy, the rope is the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon, the pole is the Earth and the ball is the counterweight. Now, imagine the ball is placed in perpetual spin around the pole, so fast that it keeps the rope taut. This is the general idea of the space elevator. The counterweight spins around the Earth, keeping the cable straight and allowing the robotic lifters to ride up and down the ribbon.
Under the design proposed by LiftPort, the space elevator would be approximately 62,000 miles (100,000 km) high. LiftPort is one of several companies developing plans for a space elevator or components of it. Teams from across the world are set to compete for the $400,000 first prize in the Space Elevator Games at the X Prize Cup in October 2006 in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
The centerpiece of the elevator will be the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon that is just a few centimeters wide and nearly as thin as a piece of paper. Carbon nanotubes, discovered in 1991, are what make scientists believe that the space elevator could be built. According to Dr. Bradley Edwards of the Spaceward Foundation, ""Previously the material challenges were too great. But now we're getting close with the advances in creating carbon nanotubes and in building machines that can spin out the great lengths of material needed to create a ribbon that will stretch up into space"" [ref].
Under some early plans, leftover construction materials will be used to form the counterweight.
Carbon nanotubes have the potential to be 100 times stronger than steel and are as flexible as plastic. The strength of carbon nanotubes comes from their unique structure, which resembles soccer balls. Once scientists are able to make fibers from carbon nanotubes, it will be possible to create threads that will form the ribbon for the space elevator. Previously available materials were either too weak or inflexible to form the ribbon and would have been easily broken.
""They have very high elastic modulus and their tensile strength is really high, and that all points to a material that, in theory, should make a space elevator relatively easy to build,"" said Tom Nugent, research director, LiftPort Group.
Long carbon nanotubes -- several meters long or longer -- would be braided into a structure resembling a rope. As of 2005, the longest nanotubes are still only a few centimeters long.
Shorter nanotubes could be placed in a polymer matrix. Current polymers do not bind well to carbon nanotubes, which results in the matrix being pulled away from the nanotubes when placed under tension.
Once a long ribbon of nanotubes is created, it would be wound into a spool that would be launched into orbit. When the spacecraft carrying the spool reaches a certain altitude, perhaps Low Earth Orbit, it would begin unspooling, lowering the ribbon back to Earth. At the same time, the spool would continue moving to a higher altitude. When the ribbon is lowered into Earth's atmosphere, it would be caught and then lowered and anchored to a mobile platform in the ocean.
The ribbon would serve as the tracks of a sort of railroad into space. Mechanical lifters would then be used to climb the ribbon to space.
If built, the ribbon will represent a modern world wonder, and will be the tallest structure ever built. Consider that the world's tallest freestanding tower in 2005 is the CN Tower, which rises 1,815 feet 5 inches (553.34 meters) over Toronto, Canada. The space elevator would be 180,720 times taller than the CN Tower!
The 62,000-mile (100,000-km) long space elevator would rise far above the average orbiting height of the space shuttle (115-400 miles/185-643 km). In fact, it would equal nearly a fourth of the distance to the moon, which orbits the Earth at 237,674 miles (382,500 km).","user
What is the proposed plan for launching and anchoring the ribbon, and how would mechanical lifters climb it to space?
Generate according to: A counterweight at the end of the space elevator will keep the carbon-nanotubes ribbon taut.
To better understand the concept of a space elevator, think of the game tetherball in which a rope is attached at one end to a pole and at the other to a ball. In this analogy, the rope is the carbon nanotubes composite ribbon, the pole is the Earth and the ball is the counterweight. Now, imagine the ball is placed in perpetual spin around the pole, so fast that it keeps the rope taut. This is the general idea of the space elevator. The counterweight spins around the Earth, keeping the cable straight and allowing the robotic lifters to ride up and down the ribbon.

**Launching and Anchoring the Ribbon**

According to the proposed plan, the carbon-nanotubes ribbon would be launched and anchored as follows:

**Launching:**

1. **Spool the ribbon:** A long ribbon of nanotubes would be wound onto a spool and launched into orbit.
2. **Unspool the ribbon:** Once the spacecraft carrying the spool reaches a certain altitude, it would begin unspooling the ribbon, lowering it back to Earth.

**Anchoring:**

1. **Catch the ribbon:** When the ribbon reaches Earth's atmosphere, it would be caught and then lowered and anchored to a mobile platform in the ocean.

**Mechanical Lifters:**

Once the ribbon is anchored, mechanical lifters would be used to climb the ribbon to space. These lifters would be able to move along the ribbon, carrying cargo and passengers.

**Additional Details:**

* The ribbon would be approximately 62,000 miles (100,000 km) high, which is far above the average orbiting height of the space shuttle.
* The space elevator would be 180,720 times taller than the CN Tower, which is the tallest freestanding tower in the world.

The wind whipped through Maya's hair, carrying with it the scent of salt and desperation. The roar of the ocean echoed through her mind, mirroring the storm raging within. Her heart, once filled with the promise of a brighter future, was now fractured, torn between two conflicting desires.

She had grown up under the watchful eye of her country, a land steeped in tradition and sacrifice. From a young age, she had been groomed to serve her nation, to be a beacon of strength and honor. Her parents, pillars of the community, had instilled in her a sense of duty, a belief that her happiness was intertwined with the well-being of her country.

But fate had painted a different canvas for Maya, one splashed with vibrant hues of personal ambition and self-discovery. She had a knack for painting, a gift that had blossomed under the guidance of her aunt, a woman who had dared to defy societal norms and carve her own path. Through her art, Maya expressed her innermost emotions, her dreams, and her yearning for a life beyond the confines of her country.

The conflict gnawed at her, a constant tug-of-war between her personal aspirations and her unwavering sense of obligation. The voices of her parents echoed in her head, ""Your country needs you, Maya. You are its hope."" The weight of her country's expectations pressed upon her shoulders, suffocating her dreams and leaving her with a sense of dread.

One evening, as she sat beneath the moonlit sky, her friend, a soldier, shared his experiences. ""We fight for a cause, Maya,"" he said, his voice laced with conviction. ""We fight for a future where our country can be free from oppression.""

For a moment, Maya felt a surge of purpose. She remembered the reason she had chosen to serve her country, the desire to bring about change. But as she looked at her canvases, filled with vibrant colors and expressive brushstrokes, she realized that her art was her way of influencing the world, of creating beauty and hope, regardless of her country's circumstances.

In the end, Maya found a balance. She continued to paint, her canvases serving as a testament to her resilience and her unwavering spirit. She also began to advocate for change, using her art as a platform to raise awareness and inspire others. Her journey was not easy, but through her unwavering determination and her unwavering belief in her own worth, she managed to bridge","The wind whipped through Maya's hair, carrying with it the scent of salt and desperation.

The humid air clung to my skin like a second skin as I stepped off the plane onto the tarmac in Kuala Lumpur. The air was thick with the scent of exhaust fumes and damp earth, and the sounds of honking horns and chatter filled my ears. I was in a foreign country, surrounded by a world that seemed alien to me.

The culture shock I experienced was overwhelming. The people were so different from me. They were more reserved, more polite, and more concerned with appearances. The food was spicy and unfamiliar, and the customs were bewildering. I couldn't even order a coffee without feeling like I was making a scene.

The language barrier was another significant challenge. I knew a few basic phrases, but I couldn't understand much of what people were saying. It was like being trapped in a world where everyone was speaking a language I didn't understand.

One of the most significant events that occurred during my time in Malaysia was my interaction with a local artist named Raja. Raja was a painter who had been influenced by Western art, but he had his own unique style. His paintings were vibrant and expressive, and they told stories about his life and his community.

Raja taught me a lot about Malaysian culture and art. He showed me the beauty of his country and the importance of art in Malaysian society. He also taught me about the importance of perseverance and creativity.

My time in Malaysia was a transformative experience. It was a journey of cultural immersion, linguistic struggle, and personal growth. I learned a lot about myself and about the world. I also made lifelong friends and memories that I cherish to this day.

I returned to my home country a changed person. I was more open-minded, more tolerant, and more appreciative of the beauty of diversity. I also had a newfound appreciation for my own culture and my own language.

My experience in Malaysia was a gift. It was a chance to learn about a new world, to expand my horizons, and to discover myself. It was a journey that I will never forget.","The humid air clung to my skin like a second skin as I stepped off the plane onto the tarmac in Kuala Lumpur.

Generate according to: Livpure, one of the well-known names in the water purifier category, has launched its new campaign around water conservation. Titled #CuttingPaani 2.0, the campaign is a quirky take on Mumbai’s popular concept of cutting chai. In an interview with exchange4media, Sushil Matey, Director, Marketing, Livpure spoke about the new campaign and how it could become the next mass movement.
Tell us about the rationale behind your new campaign #CuttingPaani2.0?
Livpure is in the B2C water business and we were keen to associate with something, which is in the larger interest of society and makes the brand come across as more holistic in nature. In India, a lot of drinking water is wasted since we do not finish our glass of water either in homes, offices, restaurants et al. Thus #CuttingPaani was conceived which is a quirky take on Mumbai’s famous concept of #CuttingChai.
Although there have been very powerful campaigns to spread awareness about water conservation, very few gave practical and doable solutions. #CuttingPaani 1.0 was a huge success in the digital and social media space because it was a doable idea and everybody could follow it. This success of #CuttingPaani 1.0 prompted us to launch the #CuttingPaani 2.0.
What were the consumer insights that Livpure accrued before getting both these campaigns out?
Our dipstick showed that Indians, in general, are very casual about wasting water. And, as we all know, it is a very scarce resource and possibly future wars would be fought for water. We waste water in a lot of ways- whether it is drinking water or water used during bathing or during brushing or shaving. We picked up #CuttingPaani since it was a catchy phrase, with it being a take on #CuttingChai. Knowing fully well that this would strike the necessary chord in making people realise that though the message is about saving drinking water it will sensitise them to the fact that we indeed waste a lot of water in other areas as well.
Why a digital film to tell the story of Shimla’s #AdoptCuttingPaani story?
In today’s time, the digital reach is high, sharp and targeting is better apart from the fact that we have the liberty of time to communicate the story, unlike an ATL medium. We are confident about the virality quotient of the campaign. In fact, a lot of newspapers in India have leveraged on our #CuttingPaani 1.0 campaign by asking readers to consume only as much as you need. Though, in a lighter vein, I must add that none of them have given us credit.
Can this campaign be converted into a mass movement?
We wish to own #CuttingPaani and take this idea further for sure and #CuttingPaani 2.0 is a step in that direction. We wish to take this further through BTL activations; social media campaigns and collaboration with large hotels/restaurants. To maintain awareness and memorability of the above, we have launched #CuttingPaaniTake on our Facebook page, which essentially gives two perspectives on topical situations.
The first example – on changing names of cities: one take is -The names of the cities are changing and the other take is -sadly, that’s the only thing changing about them!
The second example – on Mary Kom winning boxing championship: one take is -some think having children ends a woman’s career and the other take is - well, she just won her 6th boxing championship!","user

Titled #CuttingPaani 2.0, the campaign is a quirky take on Mumbai’s popular concept of cutting chai. In an interview with exchange4media, Sushil Matey, Director, Marketing, Livpure spoke about the new campaign and how it could become the next mass movement.
Tell us about the rationale behind your new campaign #CuttingPaani2.0?
Livpure is in the B2C water business and we were keen to associate with something, which is in the larger interest of society and makes the brand come across as more holistic in nature. In India, a lot of drinking water is wasted since we do not finish our glass of water either in homes, offices, restaurants et al. Thus #CuttingPaani was conceived which is a quirky take on Mumbai’s famous concept of #CuttingChai.
Although there have been very powerful campaigns to spread awareness about water conservation, very few gave practical and doable solutions. #CuttingPaani 1.0 was a huge success in the digital and social media space because it was a doable idea and everybody could follow it. This success of #CuttingPaani 1.0 prompted us to launch the #CuttingPaani 2.0.
What were the consumer insights that Livpure accrued before getting both these campaigns out?
Our dipstick showed that Indians, in general, are very casual about wasting water. And, as we all know, it is a very scarce resource and possibly future wars would be fought for water. We waste water in a lot of ways- whether it is drinking water or water used during bathing or during brushing or shaving. We picked up #CuttingPaani since it was a catchy phrase, with it being a take on #CuttingChai. Knowing fully well that this would strike the necessary chord in making people realise that though the message is about saving drinking water it will sensitise them to the fact that we indeed waste a lot of water in other areas as well.
Why a digital film to tell the story of Shimla’s #AdoptCuttingPaani story?
In today’s time, the digital reach is high, sharp and targeting is better apart from the fact that we have the liberty of time to communicate the story, unlike an ATL medium. We are confident about the virality quotient of the campaign. In fact, a lot of newspapers in India have leveraged on our #CuttingPaani 1.0 campaign by asking readers to consume only as much as you need. Though, in a lighter vein, I must add that none of them have given us credit.
Can this campaign be converted into a mass movement?
We wish to own #CuttingPaani and take this idea further for sure and #CuttingPaani 2.0 is a step in that direction. We wish to take this further through BTL activations; social media campaigns and collaboration with large hotels/restaurants. To maintain awareness and memorability of the above, we have launched #CuttingPaaniTake on our Facebook page, which essentially gives two perspectives on topical situations.
The first example – on changing names of cities: one take is -The names of the cities are changing and the other take is -sadly, that’s the only thing changing about them!
The second example – on Mary Kom winning boxing championship: one take is -some think having children ends a woman’s career and the other take is - well, she just won her 6th boxing championship!

(Verse 1)
The wind whispers secrets through the trees,
But my heart finds no solace in the breeze.
Memories dance in my mind,
Like ghosts of a love I left behind.

A burden I carry, a cruel start.
In the depths of despair,
I drown in sorrow, beyond repair.

In the strength of resilience,
I rise above the pain, and find peace.

The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the scent of cinnamon buns lingered in the air, mingling with the sweet aroma of honeysuckle that permeated the park. The sun shone warmly on their faces, casting long shadows on the emerald grass. A symphony of chirping birds filled the background score, and the gentle breeze carried the scent of the earth.

In the midst of this idyllic scene, two figures paused, their eyes meeting across the park. The woman, Maria, was a vision of grace and determination, her dark, flowing hair cascading down her back like a waterfall. Her eyes, once bright and mischievous, had matured into a deep, soulful blue, reflecting the wisdom gained from years of overcoming adversity.

The man, Ethan, stood tall, his muscular frame etched with the marks of hard work. His once unruly hair was now neatly combed back, but his mischievous grin remained unchanged. His eyes, once filled with the carefree spirit of youth, held a hint of longing and regret.

They stood there, their memories flooding back like the tide. They remembered the countless hours spent playing beneath the same trees, the shared secrets, and the dreams they had woven together. The years had taken them down different paths, but their bond remained intact.

Maria took the first step, her smile widening. ""Ethan, I never thought I'd see you here.""

Ethan's eyes mirrored her smile. ""Maria, I couldn't believe it either. I've been looking for you for years.""

They embraced, their embrace filled with years of unspoken longing and the promise of a new beginning. The park became their canvas as they shared their stories, their voices blending with the chirping of the birds. Maria spoke of her journey to becoming a successful entrepreneur, filled with resilience and determination. Ethan shared his struggles with his family business, the challenges he faced, and his unwavering optimism.

As the sun began to dip behind the trees, casting long, golden hues across the sky, Maria offered a slice of her cinnamon bun to Ethan. He took a bite, his eyes closing in delight. The taste of the warm, sweet bread filled his mouth, and he felt a sense of contentment.

In that moment, their friendship was reborn. The years of estrangement melted away, leaving only their shared experiences and unwavering support for each other. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the park, Maria and Ethan watched the sky change color.","The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the scent of cinnamon buns lingered in the air, mingling with the sweet aroma of honeysuckle that permeated the park.

## The Bounty of the Seasons: Harnessing the Power of Fresh, In-Season Produce

In the tapestry of life, food plays a pivotal role, nourishing our bodies and connecting us to the rhythms of nature. While the bounty of the grocery store offers year-round sustenance, there is a profound advantage to embracing the freshest, in-season produce. Not only does it enhance the flavor and nutritional value of our meals, but also promotes mindful eating practices and sustainable food choices.

The advantages of consuming in-season produce are manifold. Firstly, fruits and vegetables harvested in their natural season are bursting with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. These nutrients are delicate and degrade quickly when exposed to heat, transportation, and prolonged storage. By contrast, produce picked at the peak of ripeness and delivered fresh to your table retains its nutritional potency, offering a potent boost to your overall health.

Furthermore, in-season produce often boasts vibrant colors and captivating aromas, making meal planning a delight. The freshness and sweetness of summer berries, the earthy richness of winter squash, and the tangy sweetness of autumn apples inspire creative culinary creations. Each season brings its unique flavors and ingredients, inviting you to explore new culinary frontiers and experiment with fresh and innovative recipes.

Beyond the gastronomic benefits, embracing in-season produce encourages mindful eating habits. When you connect with the rhythm of nature, you become more conscious of the time and effort that goes into cultivating and harvesting food. This connection fosters a sense of gratitude for the bounty of the earth and inspires mindful consumption, reducing food waste and promoting sustainable eating practices.

For example, when you witness the delicate process of picking strawberries, you are more likely to appreciate the fruit's sweetness and savor each bite. Similarly, seeing the vibrant colors of autumnal vegetables inspires you to incorporate them into your meals, reducing the temptation to discard them. These mindful practices not only benefit your health but also contribute to a more sustainable food system.

In conclusion, the advantages of consuming in-season produce extend far beyond the table. From enhanced nutrition and flavor to mindful eating practices and sustainable food choices, it is a practice that enriches our lives on many levels. By aligning our meals with the seasons, we not only nourish our bodies but also cultivate a deeper connection to the natural world, creating a sustainable and mindful approach to food.","## The Bounty of the Seasons: Harnessing the Power of Fresh, In-Season Produce

It’s already been a year since Pope John Paul’s death. It seems only yesterday that we were out standing in Saint Peter’s Square, looking up at the familiar face in the window as he struggled to communicate with the expectant crowds below. Still fresh in our minds is the inundation of affection as the throngs poured into Rome to accompany this giant of the faith in his final hours, and to bid farewell to a dear friend.
#ad#John Paul is sorely missed. The crowds of pilgrims that have once more filled the streets of Rome to celebrate this anniversary testify to the impact he had on countless lives. More than a world leader, John Paul somehow managed to be a father and a friend to all. Even as a player on the world scene, he never lost his personal touch.
Many are now trying to reevaluate the legacy of this great pope, and as necessary as this endeavor is, a more personal reflection seems more in keeping with John Paul’s own style. I am sure that some of the things I most miss will resonate with many.
I miss, perhaps most of all, John Paul’s warmth and humanity. His quick wit and impish humor–like the vaudeville-style cane-twirling in Manila or his improvised raccoon-eyes to the delight of children–shattered notions of a dour Polish Christianity. His ability to focus on the person in front of him as if he or she were the only person in the world spoke volumes about the heart that beat in his breast. In an age when religion can be used as an excuse for violence and conflict, John Paul showed us that true faith in God is not only compatible with love for humanity, it galvanizes it. John Paul sincerely loved people–all people–and it was his Christian faith that enabled him to do so.
I miss his presence on the world scene. I remember him scolding mafia leaders in Sicily (which led to bombings of churches), fearlessly standing up to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, and defending human rights in his native Poland. He could be counted on to stand up for those most in need, to challenge world leaders to integrity, to preach Christ with an unaffected self-confidence that flowed from a deep-seated faith in God and a trust in the fundamental goodness of the human person. John Paul reached out perhaps more than any pope before him to a world in need, and provided moral authority and leadership when our generation needed it most.
I miss John Paul’s unflagging hope. His bright vision of the future and his characterization of the third millennium as a springtime of faith encouraged us to look beyond our real difficulties and to reach out for solutions. Far from a mere temperamental optimism, John Paul’s outlook was rooted in the firm belief that the battle is already won. Even from the midst of evil–John Paul wrote in his last book–God can and will continue to bring good. From his first “Be not afraid!” spoken on the day of his election in 1978 to his final witness of serene and hopeful suffering, John Paul taught us to abandon fear and to live with confidence in an infinitely good and merciful God.
I miss John Paul’s prayerfulness. Even in the midst of a grueling agenda of meetings, travels, and writings, the pontiff always made abundant time for prayer. Four hours a day was not unusual. What a challenge to those of us for whom prayer can seem at best like a luxury, or at worst like an underutilization of our precious time. Like Jesus before him, John Paul made prayer a priority and placed his trust more in God than in the best-laid programs of men and governments.
Incessant calls for John Paul’s sainthood, and the news of a probable miracle attributed to his intercession (poignantly, the cure of a French nun suffering from Parkinson’s disease) give grounds for hope that soon the Church will officially recognize what many already believe–that the man who so faithfully looked after humanity while on earth continues to do so from heaven.

Here is a piece of text: Missing Pope John Paul II.
It’s already been a year since Pope John Paul’s death. It seems only yesterday that we were out standing in Saint Peter’s Square, looking up at the familiar face in the window as he struggled to communicate with the expectant crowds below. Still fresh in our minds is the inundation of affection as the throngs poured into Rome to accompany this giant of the faith in his final hours, and to bid farewell to a dear friend.
#ad#John Paul is sorely missed. The crowds of pilgrims that have once more filled the streets of Rome to celebrate this anniversary testify to the impact he had on countless lives. More than a world leader, John Paul somehow managed to be a father and a friend to all. Even as a player on the world scene, he never lost his personal touch.

In the tapestry of life, where vibrant hues dance with delicate grace, there dwells a creature that has captured my heart and etched its indelible mark upon my soul. It is a majestic beast, a testament to the intricate interplay between beauty and strength, a creature that ignites within me a profound sense of awe and admiration.

Its coat, a canvas of silken threads, bears the imprint of the wild. Soft as moonlight on skin, it whispers secrets to the senses, unveiling hints of amber, bronze, and emerald. Its eyes, pools of liquid amber, reflect the wisdom of ages, piercing through the veil of time. When they meet yours, they ignite a spark, a connection to a spirit that roams free, unburdened by human constraints.

The lion's roar, a symphony of raw power and grace, reverberates through the savanna, sending shivers down the spines of all living creatures. It is a sound that evokes a primal response, a testament to the lion's unwavering strength and determination. In the twilight hours, as the golden sun casts long shadows across the ground, the lion comes alive, stalking its prey with stealth and precision. Its movements are fluid and swift, a dance of strength and grace.

The lion's habitat, the savanna, is a testament to its resilience and adaptability. It is a vast expanse of shimmering grasslands, punctuated by majestic trees and thorny bushes. Here, the lion reigns supreme, a king in his own domain. Yet, despite its formidable reputation, the lion is a creature of contradictions. While it exudes strength and courage, it also embodies wisdom and compassion.

My personal encounters with the lion have etched indelible memories upon my heart. One fateful day, I found myself standing face to face with a majestic lion in the heart of the savanna. Its eyes met mine, and I felt a profound connection to its spirit. The lion's gaze was intense, unwavering, and filled with a sense of ancient wisdom. In that moment, I felt humbled, as if I were witnessing the embodiment of strength and grace.

The lion, a creature of beauty, strength, and wisdom, has taught me valuable lessons about resilience, courage, and compassion. It has shown me that even in the face of adversity, one can rise above challenges and find strength within oneself.

The scent of lavender and honeysuckle lingered in the air, a fragrance that had become synonymous with the cozy familiarity of home. But tonight, the scent mingled with something else, something unsettling. It was a scent of decay and desperation, a fragrance carried on the whispers of the wind through the gnarled branches of the willow tree that stood sentinel outside.

It was a night of restless sleep, punctuated by fleeting visions of shadowy figures moving through the halls of the house. The hairs on the back of her neck prickled, and her heart hammered against her chest. In the morning, she found the hairs on her arms and neck were matted, as if something had brushed against them in the night.

The occurrences began to snowball, each one more unsettling than the last. Objects moved mysteriously, doors slammed shut without a breeze, and whispers echoed through the halls. The scent of decay intensified, and the willow tree seemed to bend its branches as if it were whispering secrets to her.

She sought answers, consulting mediums and paranormal investigators. They confirmed her suspicions - the house was haunted by a tormented soul named Amelia, a victim of a brutal crime. Amelia was trapped in a cycle of despair, unable to find peace.

With the help of a paranormal therapist, Amelia began to heal. The scent dissipated, the voices ceased, and the house breathed a sigh of relief. But the scars remained, a reminder of the tragedy that had unfolded within its walls.

The house was no longer her home, yet it was her sanctuary. It was a place of remembrance and healing, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. And in the twilight hours, as the willow tree cast long shadows across the lawn, she would sit in the garden, her mind wandering back to the days when the house had been filled with laughter and love.","The scent of lavender and honeysuckle lingered in the air, a fragrance that had become synonymous with the cozy familiarity of home.

The hum of the city, the screech of brakes, the melody of the television - all were familiar sounds to Samantha. But one night, as she drove home from work, something shifted. The radio crackled with static, the engine roared differently, and the car seemed to vibrate with an unexplainable rhythm. It was as if the car had a mind of its own, responding to her unspoken thoughts.

The revelation of her unique ability shocked Samantha. It was a secret she kept hidden, a secret she shared only with her closest friends. But the more she explored this newfound power, the more she realized its potential. The phone, the TV, the elevator in her apartment building - they all became extensions of her mind, responding to her thoughts and desires.

The benefits were undeniable. She could control her appliances with ease, navigate through the city streets without the need for maps, and even predict the weather with uncanny accuracy. But the advantages soon turned into challenges. People started noticing strange patterns in her behavior, her ability to predict the future became a source of suspicion, and her relationships began to unravel.

Her boyfriend, Mark, was the first to be affected. He felt like he was living with a ghost, a woman who could read his thoughts and manipulate his environment against his will. Her friends, once amused by her quirks, distanced themselves, afraid of her intrusive powers. Even her landlord threatened to evict her, claiming her ability was causing electrical disturbances.

The most devastating impact, however, was on her relationship with her mother. Her mother, a devout believer in traditional values, was horrified by Samantha's unconventional abilities. She blamed her for bringing misfortune into the family, isolating her and fueling her feelings of loneliness.

But through it all, Samantha remained resilient. She found solace in her ability, embraced her uniqueness, and refused to be defined by it. She discovered that her ability was not a curse, but a gift, one that she could use to help others.

She started by creating a device that allowed her to control appliances remotely. She volunteered at a hospital, where she used her ability to help patients navigate their way through the hospital and communicate with their doctors. Her story touched countless lives, and her name became synonymous with inspiration and hope.

The ruby red pomegranate, a fruit steeped in history and bursting with flavor, is my favorite. Its skin, adorned with intricate emerald-green swirls, hides a treasure trove of sweetness and tang.

When I sink my teeth into the pomegranate's flesh, a burst of sweetness explodes on my tongue, followed by a refreshing tang that lingers. The texture, soft yet firm, melts between my teeth, revealing juicy pomegranate arils, each one a burst of flavor and texture.

The pomegranate's color, ranging from crimson to deep rose, is a feast for the eyes. Its skin, vibrant red, changes hue as it ripens, revealing the juicy arils beneath. The arils, ranging from crimson to orange, are like jewels nestled within the fruit, each one a testament to the pomegranate's beauty.

Nutritionally, the pomegranate is a powerhouse of antioxidants, boasting anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties. Rich in fiber and vitamin C, it promotes gut health and overall well-being. The pomegranate's seeds are a good source of healthy fats, fiber, and antioxidants, making them a nutritious snack.

My memories of the pomegranate are intertwined with my childhood. Every fall, I eagerly awaited the arrival of the pomegranate trees, their branches laden with ripening fruit. I would spend hours picking the arils, their sweet-tart flavor melting my heart. The pomegranate was a symbol of the harvest, a testament to the bounty of nature.

One particularly memorable moment occurred when I was visiting my grandmother in her orchard. As I sat beneath the pomegranate tree, she handed me a bowl filled with freshly-squeezed pomegranate juice. The juice was sweet and refreshing, and I felt a sense of connection to my grandmother and the land.

The pomegranate is more than just a fruit; it is a symbol of resilience, longevity, and prosperity. Its enduring presence in human culture is a testament to its enduring appeal. From its humble beginnings in the Middle East to its widespread popularity today, the pomegranate continues to delight and inspire people of all ages.

So, next time you find a ruby red pomegranate, take a bite, savor the flavor, and immerse yourself in its rich history. You may find, as I have, that the pomegranate is more than just a fruit—it is a gift from the earth, a treasure to be enjoyed, and a symbol of the sweet and tangy beauty that life has to offer.","The ruby red pomegranate, a fruit steeped in history and bursting with flavor, is my favorite.

model
Yes, using a flange nut can help prevent damage to the part being secured and reduce the likelihood of loosening due to an uneven fastening surface.

**Explanation:**

A flange nut has a wide flange at one end that acts as an integrated, non-spinning washer. The flange distributes the pressure of the nut over a larger area of the part, reducing the risk of damage to the part. The serrations on the integrated washer provide a locking characteristic, preventing the nut from loosening due to vibration or an uneven fastening surface.

**Benefits:**

* **Reduced damage:** The flange distributes pressure more evenly across the part, reducing the risk of stress concentrations and cracks.
* **Increased torque retention:** The locking serrations on the washer prevent the nut from loosening due to vibration or an uneven surface.
* **Improved security:** The flange nut is less likely to loosen than a traditional nut, as it has a larger surface area and is less affected by torque fluctuations.

**Conclusion:**

Using a flange nut is an effective way to prevent damage to the part being secured and reduce the likelihood of loosening due to an uneven fastening surface. The flange nut's design distributes pressure more evenly, provides increased torque retention, and improves security.

**Additional notes:**

* Flange nuts are commonly used in high-vibration applications, such as automotive components, industrial machinery, and electrical equipment.
* The size of the flange and the number of serrations on the washer can affect its performance.
* It is important to use the correct size and type of flange nut for the application.","Yes, using a flange nut can help prevent damage to the part being secured and reduce the likelihood of loosening due to an uneven fastening surface.

A lot of drama, however, is taking place in choosing the judges in Virginia’s courtrooms.
One of the long-standing concerns of Virginia’s legal community has been the handling of judicial appointments by the General Assembly.
Unlike many states that have elected judges, Virginia leaves all judicial appointments in the hands of state legislators. In theory, this arrangement removes judges from the influence of politics. In practice, judicial appointments have become tools of patronage.
In recent years, the Virginia Bar Association and other groups have complained about judicial vacancies and mounting case backlogs in many courts throughout the commonwealth.
In 2015, however, the appointment of a Virginia Supreme Court judge became a power struggle between Gov. Terry McAuliffe and the General Assembly’s Republican leadership.
The political maneuvering that has taken place to oust McAuliffe’s appointee has provoked calls for reform of the system.
Last summer McAuliffe named former Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Jane Marum Roush to the Supreme Court while the legislature was not in session.
Republicans cried foul, claiming they were not consulted on the interim appointment. They vowed to remove Roush from the court and name their own appointee.
Attempts to oust the justice from her seat, however, were thwarted when one moderate Republican state senator, John Watkins, and then his successor, Glen H. Sturtevant Jr., failed to follow along. Their dissent denied the Republicans the majority they needed in the Virginia Senate.
In early February, the tug-of-war over the justice took a surprising turn when state Sen. Louise Lucas, a Democrat from Portsmouth, briefly agreed to join the Republicans in replacing Roush. According to news accounts, Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr., a Republican from James City County, had proposed putting Portsmouth Circuit Court Judge Kenneth R. Melvin, a former legislator and Lucas’ mentor, on the state Court of Appeals.
Lucas, however, quickly changed her stance after meeting with McAuliffe and state Sen. Donald McEachin, head of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
Twenty-seven former presidents of the Virginia Bar Association released a statement urging McAuliffe and the Republican legislative leadership to resolve their quarrel.
“One of the greatest concerns is that the unseemly exchange that has occurred will make otherwise qualified lawyers not consider a life of public service as a judge,” said Lucia Anna “Pia” Trigiani of MercerTrigiani in Alexandria, the VBA’s president in 2011.
Roush’s temporary appointment expired in mid-February, but McAuliffe is expected to appoint her to another interim term after the legislative session ends.

34,cbaf21d8a20bd4bea915b5c3139e6693ab2b8aa8764b8b885ec71557326285c4,"Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How have labour shortages affected various sectors in the Visegrad countries and what risks does this pose to their economies?

Passage: People's migration fears have been an easy one to exploit for electoral opportunism by many politicians in Europe.
Particularly in the Visegrad states of Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, it has either brought nationalist anti-immigration parties into power or helped consolidate their grip on it.
Yet, much more attention ought to be given in those countries to how much migrants are needed for their booming economies' labour markets.
This has been a result of consequent high economic GDP growth of 3-4 percent in the past five years, compared to the EU's average of two percent growth.
In 2017, these were 4.8 percent (Poland, PL); 4.3 percent (Czechia, CZ); 4.1 percent (Hungary, HU) and 3.2 percent (Slovakia, SK) respectively.
In parallel, unemployment dropped heavily to 4.9 percent (PL); 2.9 percent (CZ); 4.2 percent (HU) and 8.1 percent (SK) by 2017.
Latest European Commission forecasts show these will continue decreasing sharply to 2.9 percent (PL); 2.5 percent (CZ); 3.3 percent (HU) and 6.3 percent next year, well below the five percent normal unemployment rate.
As good as that might sound, a side-effect has been that many vacancies remained unfulfilled.
The amount of open vacancies has more than quadrupled in the past five years. Especially in Czechia and Poland this is causing serious problems, despite the latter's profiting from Ukrainian migrants.
The commission's Spring and Autumn forecasts highlight these risks, which could undermine long-term growth, or even overheat the economy in the case of Czechia.
For Poland, despite the Ukrainian influx, there are doubts whether they can continue filling some of these shortages.
Business surveys confirm labour shortages limit production, building activity and business.
In industry, 43.7 percent (CZ); 83.3 percent (HU); 49.9 percent (PL); and 34.9 percent (SK) of surveyed companies state this is a problem.
For the construction sector, 37.8 percent (CZ); 64.4 percent (HU); 49.0 percent (PL) and 30.3 percent (SK) do.
Moreover, in services 17.3 percent (CZ); 38.3 percent (HU); 28.9 percent (PL) and 18.6 percent (SK) attest.
The labour shortages have also led to wages rising much faster than the rise in productivity.
In Slovakia and Hungary, Volkswagen and Kia for instance were forced to significantly increase wages because of strikes. Generally, labour costs are spiking in the Visegrad states.
While benefitting workers in the short-term, the economy could suffer in the long-term, as they undermine their low-wage economic models. It also jeopardises essential foreign investment that has helped drive growth.
In addition, the V4 is set to suffer as well from its demographic situation. Emigration and low fertility rates remain serious problems, dating back to their economic shock-therapy transitions where many struggled and had no jobs.
Due to this, populations remained stagnant since 1990.
The 2004 EU accession, particularly, caused many to emigrate abroad in search of (better paid) work abroad: circa three million people (registered) left the V4 between 2004 and 2016.
While profiting from remittances, this caused brain drain and the outflow of high-skilled labour. In turn, it also undermined welfare spending and made government budgets less growth friendly.
Demographics could constrain economic growth and governmental budgets again in the future.
Baseline projections for 2020 up to 2060 show the Visegrad Four's population could decrease by another 6.5 million people. In addition, the dependency ratio is set to increase sharply as well.
The dire demographic situation and labour shortages imply action is needed. Tight labour markets have already limited economic expansion in different sectors.
While in Poland Ukrainian labour prevented worse labour shortages, it is unclear how many more will come or stay. This means for Poland, as well as for the others that additional migrants from elsewhere will be needed.
More could be done as well to promote people having children and attract former emigrants. It should also make sure to keep current migrants, especially Ukrainians in the case of Poland.
Current hostile rhetoric on migration could backfire economically as many more migrants are needed to fill labour shortages and keep economies running smoothly.
This also requires honest debates in which the pros and cons of migration are discussed, as well as the Visegrad's overall demographic problems, since dependency ratios will continue to increase.
Therefore, rather than focusing on the imagined threat of migration and exploiting fears for electoral opportunism, the Visegrad's politicians would be wise to focus on the actual threat of how the lack of migrants could undermine their economic models, and with it their future prosperity and welfare.
Moreover, while migration has been a successful strategy to win elections in the short term, it could backfire in the long term.

Este año, el Lord Mayor no estaba disponible para recibirnos, pero Andrew Montague fue muy amable y nos condujo y respondió todas nuestras preguntas.

La Casa de la Mansión es una hermosa casa construida por Joshua Dawson, por lo que la calle en la que se ubica se denominó Dawson Street en su honor. Ha sido hogar de los lord mayors de Dublín desde 1715.

Vimos los escudos de familia de todos los lord mayors en las paredes de la habitación en la que estábamos, y algunos de nosotros vieron nuestros propios escudos de familia y tomaron fotos de ellos.

Tuvimos un gran día de salida y uno que nunca olvidaremos."

The scent of fresh bread and honeysuckle, the sweet chirping of birds, and the gentle rustling of leaves outside my window painted a symphony of senses that filled my heart with contentment. It was a time when the world seemed to hum in perfect harmony, a melody echoed in my soul by the rhythmic breathing of my beloved companion, Luna.

Growing up, I had always dreamed of having a dog, but my family was hesitant to commit to the responsibility. However, fate took a twist in the form of a timid, gray tabby named Luna, who would forever alter the course of my life.

One fateful afternoon, as I strolled through the park, I encountered a small, frail creature huddled beneath a willow tree. Her coat was matted, and her eyes were filled with a mix of fear and desperation. I approached cautiously, my heart filled with compassion. As I reached out to offer comfort, Luna's timid nature melted away, and she snuggled into my arms.

The first few months were an adjustment. Luna was a whirlwind of energy, and her antics often kept me on edge. But as I began to understand her quirks and routines, I found solace in her companionship. Her soft purrs and gentle head bumps were my constant companions, a testament to the profound bond we shared.

When I faced adversity, Luna was my rock. During my darkest hours, she would curl up on the floor beside me, her purrs resonating with the rhythm of my breathing. Her presence was a reminder that I was not alone. Her companionship offered me strength and resilience, helping me to navigate through the challenges that life presented.

In the face of tragedy, Luna was my source of strength. When my grandmother passed away, I was devastated. As I mourned, Luna showered me with love, her soft, comforting presence filling the void left by my beloved grandmother. Her presence brought me solace and helped me to find strength amidst the grief.

Through the years, Luna became more than just a pet. She was my confidant, my protector, and my soulmate. Her unconditional love and unwavering loyalty taught me the power of compassion, patience, and resilience.

Today, as I look back at the journey we shared, I am grateful for the profound impact Luna had on my life. She was more than just a pet; she was a guardian, a companion, and a teacher. Her spirit continues to inspire me to live a life filled with love, compassion,","The scent of fresh bread and honeysuckle, the sweet chirping of birds, and the gentle rustling of leaves outside my window painted a symphony of senses that filled my heart with contentment.

Audi cars have been featured in many movies over the years. Did you spot one in these films?
Thought by many to be the most successful movie franchises ever to be created, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has different movies for everyone. There have been 21 films released already — the most recent being Captain Marvel — and at least a dozen more in the pipeline.
You don’t only enjoy the action in these films, but you may also be able to spot a stylish Audi, too.
When it comes to the Iron Man trilogy, at least one Audi has been featured in every film! A 2007 R8 and S5 B8 can be found in the first movie, a 2009 A8 LD3 and 2010 R8 Spyder are spotted in the sequel, and a 2012 S7 and R8 e-tron are both featured in Iron Man 3. The R8 e-tron also turned up at a VIP screening of Iron Man 3 at London’s Leicester Square a few days before the movie’s general release.
Another Audi fact is that there were almost as many Audi cars in the three Iron Man movies as there was in one Captain America film (Civil War). Within its two hours and 27 minutes runtime, you can see the 2017 Audi R8 V10 Plus, the 2017 SQ7, the 2017 A4, the 2016 A7 Sportback and even the Audi prologue concept car — a vehicle hailed as a “signature car” for Audi by Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Board Member for Development at Audi.
There’s more than meets the eye, though. Be on the lookout for an Audi R8, A6 Hybrid and A3 as you watch the excitement unfold in Avengers: Age of Ultron, as well as an Audi TTS Roadster, R8 Spyder, Q7 and A8 during Spider-Man Homecoming — the first standalone film by our favorite web-slinger since he became involved in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Taking a step back from the Marvel Universe, the German brand is also spotted in other film adaptations of comic book heroes. An R8 Spyder feature in Wolverine — the titular protagonist’s actor Hugh Jackman even turned up at the London Leicester Square premiere of the film in the same car — and an A8 plays a role in the 2015 big screen edition of Fantastic Four.
You also might’ve noticed the German manufacturer’s presence in all three film adaptations of E.L. James’ novels, which follow the relationship of business magnate Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.
What made this brand of car most attractive to the directors of this film? The brand’s multiple appearances came as a result of a partnership that was set up between Audi and Universal Pictures — a deal that Audi no doubt has relished seeing as the movie series has grossed over $1 billion across the globe!
In the first film of the trilogy, movie fans will be able to spot an Audi S8 D4, a 2017 S7 and an R8 Spyder. In the sequel, Fifty Shades Darker, a set of Audi Q7 cars and an A3 took center stage, with both the R8 and Q7 returning when the franchise wrapped up last year with Fifty Shades Freed.
To talk about Audi’s feature in Mission Impossible, let’s rewind back to the year 2000 and Mission: Impossible 2 to showcase how Audi has been featured in the hit movie series that has always starred Tom Cruise in the lead role of Ethan Hunt.
In a thrilling part of the film, Hunt leads a mission to destroy a deadly biological weapon and finds himself in an exhilarating car chase with international thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall. Hunt is behind the wheel of a Porsche Boxster and Nordoff-Hall tries to hold him off while driving an Audi TT — suffice to say that the pursuit between the two German-made cars into oncoming traffic is filled with nail-biting and edge-of-your-seat drama!
We couldn’t create an article about movies and cars without mentioning the Fast and Furious franchise. After all, this is a series that features street racing, heists, and espionage using all manners of vehicles, and has so far spanned eight main series entries and two additional short films — grossing in excess of $5 billion to date.
Fans are continually impressed with films that come out as part of this movie set. In fact, a spin-off movie called Hobbs & Shaw is due for release this summer.
Bringing a focus to Furious 7 now — a movie that clutched at the heartstrings as it was the final one to feature an appearance by series regular Paul Walker due to the actor being killed while the movie was still being filmed — is where you can see Audi appearing in the franchise.
You can spot the Audi R8 when it competes in an exciting quarter-mile race against a classic Plymouth Barracuda in the early moments of the film.
In the previously discussed films, the Audi’s that were featured are all models that exist. With I, ROBOT though, we’re taken to the future to see what Audi cars may potentially look like in years to come. Called the Audi RSQ, this concept vehicle represented the first time Audi had ever develop a car that was to be specifically used in a major Hollywood motion picture.
This futuristic model boasted piloted driving which allowed Will Smith’s Chicago police detective character Del Spooner to press a button to enable the car to take control of the driving — no doubt an early vision of the autonomous driving concept that we are only just starting to see being trialed in real life.
Those who take a ride in the RSQ are able to ride sideways and diagonal, while the use of balls instead of wheels was a quirky design touch. However, the typical single-frame grille and the presence of those four instantly recognizable silver rings let viewers clearly know that this car was without question an Audi.

What were some of the key factors that led to the widespread Viking raids and invasions during this period?
model
**Key Factors Leading to Viking Raids and Invasions:**

**1. Scandinavian Expansionism:**
- The Vikings, descendants of Scandinavian warriors, sought expansion and plunder. Their advanced naval technology and skilled warriors made them formidable seafarers.

**2. Economic Opportunism:**
- Viking raids were often motivated by economic gain. The spoils of war, including valuable goods and slaves, provided significant financial incentives.

**3. Religious Beliefs:**
- Norse mythology influenced Viking beliefs. Valhalla, the afterlife for warriors, was seen as a place of honor and glory, motivating warriors to seek glory through battle.

**4. Tribal Rivalries:**
- Viking raids were sometimes driven by tribal rivalries and the desire to gain power and control.

**5. Political Instability:**
- The Scandinavian region was politically unstable during this period, with frequent conflicts and power struggles. Viking raids provided an outlet for excess aggression.

**6. Geographical Factors:**
- The Vikings had a natural advantage in their possession of advanced naval technology, allowing them to control the seas and travel widely. Their settlements in Greenland and Iceland provided bases for their raids.

**7. The Anglo-Saxon Weakness:**
- The Anglo-Saxons in Britain were vulnerable to Viking attacks due to their reliance on mercenaries and their lack of strong naval defenses.

**8. The Byzantine Weakness:**
- The Byzantine Empire was also a target for Viking raids, as the Vikings sought to plunder wealthy cities and control trade routes.

**9. The Viking Code of Law:**
- The Vikings had a well-established code of law, known as the Rigsthava, which governed warfare and justice.

**10. The Legacy of the Vikings:**
- The Viking raids and invasions left a lasting legacy on Europe. They contributed to the spread of Scandinavian culture and influence, and their contributions to warfare and navigation have influenced Western civilization.","**Key Factors Leading to Viking Raids and Invasions:**

Passage: Molly Ivins was the most popular liberal commentator of the last 25 years. Bill Minutaglio, author of a new biography of the tangy Texan, on why her voice is needed now more than ever.
There was Morley Safer, in a scrum of old hardball Texas liberals and graying hippies, and hanging out at his late friend Molly Ivins's favorite bar in Austin. With pitchers of Shiner everywhere, Safer was engulfed by dozens of folks wondering what the hell the woman who once had millions of faithful readers would say about health care, Afghanistan, and, yes, Rush Limbaugh’s attempt to own a piece of the Texas Blood Sport, otherwise known as professional football.
Safer, in town to donate his papers to the University of Texas, decided to drop by the book launch for my new biography of the ferociously mercurial and troubled Ivins.
Amid the weathered longhairs, musicians, underground cartoonists and civil liberties lawyers who once formed Austin's counterculture—the people Ivins called “freedom fighters”—Safer seemed merrily caught up in the nostalgia.
""She was one of the funniest and (most) thoughtful women I've ever met,"" Safer told a reporter from The Daily Texan. ""She was a great reporter, and we were good friends.""
Close to three years after her death, he's not alone in missing Ivins.
Nose around the Internet and you'll find plenty of other people still wishing she was writing—and wondering what Ivins, if she hadn't succumbed almost three years ago to cancer and a lifetime of wild personal rides, would have to say about the discourse in the twilight of 2009.
They miss the Texas cornpone flavored with a Tabasco sting, the unabashed defrocking she subjected the potentates to when they stole the stage. Maybe we need Molly—frequently described as “the only woman in the room”—more than ever before.
Her domineering father was the president of Tenneco and pals with men like Sen. John Tower, she grew up with George W. Bush, she was engaged to the son of a diplomat who did the CIA’s bidding. But after years of going to war with her controlling old man, devouring seditious issues of the muckraking Texas Observer, and furtively meeting the bravest Texas progressives, she eventually decided to raise a middle finger to all of her gilded upbringing.
It took a few years and some intense trip wires—the violent death of that fiance, her love affair with a ballsy activist, her knocking Bush's gun-toting political godfather to his knees one night in a Texas bar, her telling her bosses at The New York Times to shove it—but she finally found her calling as the most popular liberal political commentator in the last 25 years.
The fact that she did it in the Lone Star State, amid the misogynistic and Jack Daniels-fueled kingmakers, was rather startling to say the least. She fought sexual gropings by famous drunk politicos, three bouts of cancer, her own rampaging alcoholism—and plenty of death threats.
Through it all, Ivins kept the home fires burning for wandering progressives, liberal Israelites, who felt marginalized since the dawn of The Age of Reagan.
So, what would Molly Ivins say to those millions of readers today, including the ones beginning to think there has been some bait-and-switch at work with Obama?
Divorced from how you feel about her politics, most students of her work knew that she had perfected a magic act when it came to that public discourse; she talked about politics without the dour aura of either Emma Goldman or Charles Krauthammer. Nor did she scream with the raging acidity of Bill O’Reilly and Glenn Beck and their counterparts on the left. She chortled that Dubya was affable but a policy buffoon; she actually liked him personally, but hated his politics. And she spent years, and made a mint, working Bush over like his political career was one big speed bag. It was, as she sometimes told me and other folks in Austin, almost too easy.
Today, it might be a bit harder. She liked Obama and she thought he was far smarter than Bush. She’d maybe have to tap the piñata a bit more lightly in order to say what she wanted to say about Obama, about any sense of failed promises. But she would do it, and do it her way.
She would do it because she didn’t believe that a democracy was served very well by the vitriol, by the poison, by the hatred snaking through the discourse.

I had a family and other love ones.
How about you where do you stand?
When my heart still dies in front.
You killed the old beast in my gloom.
Fell us in love like a feather.
We stumbl’d upon each other.
Which witty poem did you inspire in me, what sincere praise did you give my words when I thought enough of you send a poem your wayWhich line did you write with my spirit surrounding you?
Why do I say I love you.?  Were you sincere when you said amen to the wisdom that I shared, were you one of those who thought your mocking, was more valuable than complianceI have lived with the resentments of scoffers.
The message for the masses is hope...so, I live  for the poems you send my wayFor, I grow strong in our relationship sailed by the winds of your encouragement, to my poets, my true friends; I truly know who you are, don't ever think I don’t!
Who Would Want To Be This Cold?
They said you needed surgery.
I drove you to the funeral home.
The arrangements were for you.
I had to wait outside that day.
I couldn't go in there.
I don't know how you made those plans.
You showed how much you cared.
You knew you wouldn't make it.
You feared the end was near.
I hate what your life did to you.
I wish you were still here.
How do you plan your funeral?
Were you as scared as I?
What were your thoughts heading to the docs?
Did you know that you would die?
I miss you more and more everyday, That's why I drink so much to take this   pain awayThe pain don't really go away it comes back, and I get so lost I don't know how to actI get lost in my thoughts of you, It kills me you can't come back ever no matter what I do, This is the hardest thing I ever had to go threwSome people say time will heal, but I know I'll be missing you still, It feels like I'm living in a bad nightmare I wish it wasn't realIf I could go back in time, I would go back and press rewindI would go to that day the 2nd of July, and make sure you were okay and you didn't dieAll I got got now are our memories and the tears I cry, To keep it together it's hard but believe me I try.
That your 'i love you' wasn't you lying""
yet all I feel is an emptiness inside..
Why did you have to leave?
Why does this have to hurt?
Cancer robbed thy life from thee..
But you went to heaven, and you went away.
That we'd die together in forevers sleep.
You didn't even say goodbye as you left me here.
I'm failing to choke down all these tears.
My face becomes moist, my sight turns to mist.
With my frown turned lips, i give you a kiss.
I try to look away as they lower your casket.
I'll try to survive, but I don't think i can las it.
I throw your favorite flowers into your grave.
Watching people throw dirt, over you they pave.
I feel no solace, I'm all alone.
As I see your name set in stone.
I feel a breeze, it's a wind so cold.
I remember the final words you had told..
You said to me, ""Don't take your life.""
I asked you, ""Why?"", as I put down the knife.
You told me you loved me, as its your final wish.
I shook my head yes, though I feel no bliss.
Why god took you away from me, but i will live on.
I hear your comforting whispers, I think its a sign.
So I know I'll see you agian when its my time.
The skeletal remains are being chalked out,while mystery and intrigue are engraven, cryptic.Lying beneath, this freshly seeded idea;upon these grounds, the words are etched,what are you looking for and how will you get it,for these are but the bare bones of a story.The key alone is in your closet, slowly turning,as you opened the creaking rusted door.You slowly peep inside the mausoleum of your mind,where cobwebs hang on every angle.Suddenly, a cold swift draft blows across your spine,as if someone has just, walked on your grave. You look up to see, all the entrapping’s laidbut then again, you are still lying in a good plot.
I’m going home to Jesus where He waits for me.
Spread your colored petals and cradle tender showers.
Ought we not to know the Tender of such lovely garden groves?
To cut away the stems of old for fuller future years.
Looking daily to their needs; so faithfully He waters.
When the Gardener comes to claim each one the earth held as its own.
He gently picks it at its peak and for His pleasure takes it home.
As God did one glorious morning, when the Perfect Rose had bloomed.
He rolled away the stone and met with Mary at the tomb.
There the sweetest Rose of Sharon rose that we die not alone.
But be gathered for a garden grove, surrounding heaven's throne.
I pray you will find.
and a peace of mind.
with God, you shall prevail.
you will never, never fail.

If you managed to generate very good ideas, conducted a thorough research, and organized your paper logically, but have made several grammar or spelling mistakes, your grade would be lowered. Revising and editing academic paper should be done several days prior to submission. Why? Because you need to leave your writing aside and then look at it with the fresh eye. Term paper editing is not about looking through your writing while listening to music, you need to be very attention and stay focused on numerous details.
First, take a look at your essay outline. Go through all points and try to change the order of ideas: make sure you have created a logical structure and ideas are presented either chronologically or thematically (from the least important to the most important). Locate thesis statement. Is it clear? Are there topic sentences in each paragraph? Are they related to the thesis statement? Are connections between the paragraphs clear or do you jump from one idea to another?
Essay body should contain enough supporting details contributing to thesis statement development. For example, if your topic is legalization of marijuana, you need to find at least three arguments supporting your point of view and provide rebuttal to the opposing views. Introduction and conclusion should not contain new information: introduction should provide general background information on the topic and inform the reader about your main idea, while conclusion should round up the whole essay.
Pay attention to each paragraph: it should include topic sentence and cover one point of discussion. Make sure you do not repeat the same idea twice in different parts of essay. Repeating is a sign of poor organization. Check the grammar - ask your parents or friends to assist you with essay editing . Pay attention to correct punctuation, avoid too short or too long sentences.
Revising is not the same as editing. Essay editing is about correcting mistakes, while essay revising is making major changes in your writing, adding ideas and deleting material. Revising should lead to overall paper improvement. Read your essay and if you do not like it, revise it. Ask yourself the following questions: what do I need to prove? What is the main idea? Is there enough supporting evidence? Are arguments clear and logical? Is my essay easy to understand? Have I cited all sources? Is introduction attention getting? Is conclusion logical?

What is the difference between essay editing and essay revising?: Editing is one of the most important steps of college research paper writing. If you managed to generate very good ideas, conducted a thorough research, and organized your paper logically, but have made several grammar or spelling mistakes, your grade would be lowered. Revising and editing academic paper should be done several days prior to submission. Why? Because you need to leave your writing aside and then look at it with the fresh eye. Term paper editing is not about looking through your writing while listening to music, you need to be very attention and stay focused on numerous details.
First, take a look at your essay outline. Go through all points and try to change the order of ideas: make sure you have created a logical structure and ideas are presented either chronologically or thematically (from the least important to the most important). Locate thesis statement. Is it clear? Are there topic sentences in each paragraph? Are they related to the thesis statement? Are connections between the paragraphs clear or do you jump from one idea to another?
Essay body should contain enough supporting details contributing to thesis statement development. For example, if your topic is legalization of marijuana, you need to find at least three arguments supporting your point of view and provide rebuttal to the opposing views. Introduction and conclusion should not contain new information: introduction should provide general background information on the topic and inform the reader about your main idea, while conclusion should round up the whole essay.
Pay attention to each paragraph: it should include topic sentence and cover one point of discussion. Make sure you do not repeat the same idea twice in different parts of essay. Repeating is a sign of poor organization. Check the grammar - ask your parents or friends to assist you with essay editing . Pay attention to correct punctuation, avoid too short or too long sentences.
Revising is not the same as editing. Essay editing is about correcting mistakes, while essay revising is making major changes in your writing, adding ideas and deleting material. Revising should lead to overall paper improvement. Read your essay and if you do not like it, revise it. Ask yourself the following questions: what do I need to prove? What is the main idea? Is there enough supporting evidence? Are arguments clear and logical? Is my essay easy to understand? Have I cited all sources? Is introduction attention getting? Is conclusion logical?

## Venice vs. Other Major European Cities: Urban Planning and Architecture in the Renaissance and Beyond

Venice, a city steeped in history and known for its canals and breathtaking architecture, offers a unique perspective on urban planning and architecture from the Renaissance to the present day. Comparing it with other major European cities during the same period reveals its distinctive character and its enduring influence.

**Urban Planning:**

* **Unique Water-Based Layout:** Unlike other major European cities, Venice was built on a series of islands and canals. This unique water-based layout dictated its urban planning, with streets designed for boats rather than cars. The canals served as the city's lifeline, connecting different neighborhoods and facilitating trade.
* **Decentralized Structure:** Unlike the centralized layouts of cities like Paris or Rome, Venice had a more decentralized structure. Different neighborhoods, each with its own distinct character, were connected through the canal network. This decentralized layout fostered a sense of community and autonomy.
* **Flexible Expansion:** Unlike other European cities that expanded outwards, Venice grew vertically. Buildings often reached tall heights, maximizing space on the limited land. This vertical expansion contributed to the city's unique skyline and its iconic Venetian atmosphere.

**Architecture:**

* **Renaissance Masterpieces:** Venice was a hub of artistic innovation during the Renaissance, and its architecture reflects this spirit. Buildings like St. Mark's Basilica and Doge's Palace showcase the use of classical forms, intricate details, and vibrant colors.
* **Gothic Influence:** While the Renaissance flourished, Venice also incorporated Gothic elements into its architecture, evident in churches like Santa Maria Gloriosa degli Uffizi. This blend of Renaissance and Gothic styles created a unique architectural harmony.
* **Venetian Gothic:** Venetian Gothic architecture developed a distinct style characterized by flamboyant ornamentation, intricate carvings, and colorful facades. This distinctive style influenced other cities, particularly in the Veneto region.

**Comparison with Other Major European Cities:**

* **Paris:** Paris, known as the ""City of Light,"" also flourished during the Renaissance. It boasts a more centralized layout and iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame Cathedral. While Venice emphasizes water-based travel, Paris developed its own unique network of boulevards and avenues.
* **Rome:** Rome, the Eternal City, was a powerful Roman center during the Renaissance. Its ancient ruins and historical significance are unmatched. While Venice's architecture reflects the Renaissance, Rome's heritage is deeply rooted in its Roman past","## Venice vs. Other Major European Cities: Urban Planning and Architecture in the Renaissance and Beyond

In his remarks, Dr. Cortes said that in order for the Strategic Plan to be successful, certain characteristics are vital: creativity and agility; globalization; entrepreneurial spirit; and the desire to harness technology to advance teaching, learning and administrative operations. Berkeley College will continue to build upon its solid foundation by harnessing these attributes, he added.
A leader in business education for 78 years, Berkeley College maintains an enrollment of over 7,200 students, with more than 700 international students in its Baccalaureate and Associate degree programs. The College has four New Jersey campuses located in Woodland Park (formerly West Paterson), Paramus, Woodbridge, and Newark; two New York campuses in Midtown Manhattan and White Plains; and an Extension Center in Lower Manhattan in the Wall Street area. In addition, the College offers Berkeley College Online and its Corporate Learning Partnership program. All campuses are accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The College’s website address is www.BerkeleyCollege.edu.

The recent weeks have seen significant fluctuations in gold prices, influenced by both central bank policies and global economic data.

**Central Bank Policies:**

* **Federal Reserve:** Hawkish comments from Fed officials and the expectation of an upcoming interest rate hike have caused investors to withdraw their bullish bets on gold, leading to a drop in prices.
* **European Central Bank:** Hints of more monetary stimulus from the ECB have strengthened the Euro and weakened the dollar, negatively impacting gold prices.

**Global Economic Data:**

* **Soft global economic data:** Soft global economic data has decreased investor risk appetite, leading to a decline in demand for gold as a safe haven.

* **Bank of Japan:** The Bank of Japan's decision to stand pat on policy has bolstered demand for gold.
* **Market volatility:** The overall market volatility has been high, with the price of gold fluctuating significantly in recent weeks.

**Overall, the recent decline in gold prices is primarily due to the strengthening dollar and the increasing likelihood of higher U.S. interest rates. Additionally, soft global economic data and the potential for further easing from the ECB have contributed to the downward trend.**

## Public Transit Challenge: A Month of Change

**Day 1-2:**

The first two days were an adjustment. I had to factor in extra time for transfers, navigate unfamiliar routes, and contend with the ebb and flow of passengers. But I discovered the charm of seeing the city from a different perspective, glimpses of life unfolding through the windows.

**Challenges:**

* **Time:** Transfers and crowded buses added extra time to my commute.
* **Accessibility:** Some stations were inaccessible due to construction or lack of elevators.
* **Safety:** Concerns about pickpocketing and harassment lingered, though I never experienced any issues.

**Unexpected Benefits:**

* **Community:** I encountered friendly locals who shared their tips and stories.
* **Exercise:** Walking to and from bus stops increased my daily steps.
* **Mindfulness:** The slow pace and the constant flow of people forced me to be present in the moment.

**Day 3-20:**

The third week was a breeze. I had optimized my routes, found my favorite spots on the buses, and embraced the rhythm of the city. I even discovered hidden gems like local museums and cozy cafes within walking distance of stations.

**Changes:**

* **Routine:** My daily schedule shifted to accommodate bus schedules, but I found a sense of rhythm and predictability.
* **Habits:** I started reading books on the bus, listened to podcasts, and even started meditating.
* **Socialization:** I interacted with passengers, shared stories, and made new friends.

**Day 21-30:**

The final week was bittersweet. I was grateful for the experience and the positive changes it brought, but I also felt a sense of freedom returning to my own car.

**Reflections:**

This challenge was a revelation. Public transportation is not just a convenient way to get around, it's a gateway to a more connected and sustainable city. I urge everyone to try it, even for a day. You might be surprised by the benefits and the positive impact it can have on your life.

Jason Nisbit, 39, is facing a charge of second degree homicide with intent in the death of 26-year-old Chelsea Martinez. A friend said Martinez’s husband found she'd been on a social networking site and had an exchange of disturbing messages with a man in Minnesota. Investigators tracked the profile to Nisbit. In the messages, Martinez said she can't wait to die but expresses fear over the idea. The two discuss how Nisbit will do it. Martinez said she will finally be at peace and thanks him. Martinez's car and body were found near a Minnesota park last week. Police say Nisbit admitted to killing her and took them to the body.

The Harvest Festival was abuzz with the scent of freshly cut corn and sweet candy apples, but for Lily, the air crackled with a sense of dread. The sun dipped behind the towering stalks, casting long, ominous shadows across the intricately designed corn maze. The maze was shrouded in an unsettling quiet, broken only by the rustle of leaves and the occasional sigh of a visitor passing by.

As she entered the maze, Lily felt her senses being overwhelmed by the labyrinth of winding pathways and towering corn stalks. The maze was a labyrinth of illusions, its walls adorned with grotesque carvings of skeletal hands and decaying faces. The air was thick with the scent of decaying vegetation and the sweet aroma of blood.

With each step she took, Lily felt her grip on the ground tighten as she battled her growing fear. The maze seemed to twist and turn against her, its walls closing in like a cage. The rustling leaves whispered secrets in her ear, and the wind carried whispers of impending doom.

She encountered terrifying supernatural entities along her journey. A ghostly figure, its decaying skin and hollow eyes, trailed her through the maze, its cold hand reaching out to grab her. A demonic entity, its fiery red eyes and sharp claws, emerged from the shadows, its voice dripping with honeyed sweetness. Each encounter left her with a sense of dread and helplessness.

Finally, after what felt like hours of wandering through the maze, Lily stumbled upon a clearing. In the center, a lone barn stood tall, its dilapidated walls and crumbling roof revealing a hidden secret. As she approached the barn, she felt a wave of relief. Surely, this was her escape.

But as she opened the barn door, a terrifying sight greeted her. The barn was filled with the skeletal remains of former visitors, their decaying bodies arranged in a grotesque dance. And in the center of the room, a single candle flickered, casting long, ominous shadows across the walls.

But the true horror lay in the identity of the person holding the candle. It was herself, her reflection, but with a sinister smile on her face. She had been tricked by her own fear, and she knew that she was trapped in the maze forever.","The Harvest Festival was abuzz with the scent of freshly cut corn and sweet candy apples, but for Lily, the air crackled with a sense of dread.

    - Modern and elegant serif font with a clean and simple design.
    - Exudes a sense of authority and sophistication.
    - Can also be slightly challenging to read for extended periods.

* **Helvetica:**
    - Clean and modern sans-serif font with a neutral personality.
    - Exudes a sense of modernity and simplicity.
    - Easy to read for extended periods.

* **Open Sans:**
    - Open and friendly sans-serif font with a slightly vintage feel.

When you want something sweet, it’s hard to resist the classic chocolate chip cookie. It’s sweet. It’s comforting. It’s loyal. It’s basically your BFF.
But, for those times you don’t want your BFF to be loaded with refined sugar, simple carbs, and unhealthy fats, you’re in luck because I gave your BFF a make-over! It’s pretty much the chocolate chip cookie of your dreams. These deep dish cookies are full of protein, low in fat, grain free, and low in sugar. No joke! A typical chocolate chip cookie has about 13 grams of sugar and 2 grams of protein. Howevah, these delicious treats have a whopping 8 grams of protein and a measly 2 grams of refined sugar!
And because I am with everything else in life, I am also indecisive about wanting a super chewy cookie or a really crispy one. So, if you needed another reason to love these deep dish cookies, you get the best of both worlds with them! They have a nice, crispy edge with a soft, chewy center. The trick to getting this combo is baking them in a muffin tin. Not only is it easy and convenient, but it also keeps the cookies from spreading out while baking, giving them the chewy center. And because the batter is touching the pan all the way around, you get a nice, crispy edge. It’s like the corner piece of a pan of brownies, but all around! Once again, it’s like unicorns invaded your dreams and made your wishes come true.
And whipping up these high protein treats couldn’t be any easier. As long as you’ve got a blender or food processor you’re in business, because we’re going to puree some chickpeas. Just trust me on this one. These little gems are going to give your cookies some texture, chewiness, and replaces the flour so the cookies are grain-free. Once you’ve got them pureed, all you need to do is mix the dry ingredients, stir together the wet ingredients, and then combine that all together.
Preheat the oven to 325 F. Grease a 12 cup muffin tin.
In a food processor or blender, puree the chickpeas with the water until smooth.
In a large bowl, add the coconut flour, protein powder, sweetener, baking powder and soda, and salt.
In a seperate bowl, combine the chickpea puree, egg, yogurt, milk, oil, and vanilla. Stir or whisk until fully combined.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until fully incorporated.
Evenly distribute the batter into the prepared muffin tins. It will be about 1.5 - 2 Tbsps of dough per cookie.
Smooth out the batter so batter touches the edges of the pan, but don't press/flatten the dough.
Bake for 14 min. or until the edges of the cookies turn golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cookie dough comes out clean.
Allow the cookies to cool completely in the pan.
Feel free to top with nut butter, jam, or more chocolate and eat 'em up!

Sometimes dreams come true and miracles happen and high protein chocolate chip cookies come into existence.
When you want something sweet, it’s hard to resist the classic chocolate chip cookie. It’s sweet. It’s comforting. It’s loyal. It’s basically your BFF.
But, for those times you don’t want your BFF to be loaded with refined sugar, simple carbs, and unhealthy fats, you’re in luck because I gave your BFF a make-over! It’s pretty much the chocolate chip cookie of your dreams. These deep dish cookies are full of protein, low in fat, grain free, and low in sugar. No joke! A typical chocolate chip cookie has about 13 grams of sugar and 2 grams of protein. Howevah, these delicious treats have a whopping 8 grams of protein and a measly 2 grams of refined sugar!
And because I am with everything else in life, I am also indecisive about wanting a super chewy cookie or a really crispy one. So, if you needed another reason to love these deep dish cookies, you get the best of both worlds with them! They have a nice, crispy edge with a soft, chewy center. The trick to getting this combo is baking them in a muffin tin. Not only is it easy and convenient, but it also keeps the cookies from spreading out while baking, giving them the chewy center. And because the batter is touching the pan all the way around, you get a nice, crispy edge. It’s like the corner piece of a pan of brownies, but all around! Once again, it’s like unicorns invaded your dreams and made your wishes come true.

**Explanation:**

* The `remove_duplicates()` function takes a list `arr` of integers as input.
* It iterates over the list twice using two nested loops to compare adjacent elements.
* If two elements are found to be duplicates, the element at the second position is removed from the list.
* The function handles errors for invalid input, such as non-list inputs and non-integer elements.
* The modified list without duplicates is returned as the output.

**Time complexity:**

* The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the list.
* This is because the loop iterates over the list twice, and each iteration takes O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the list.

**Space complexity:**

**Institution:** University of California, Berkeley

**Abstract:**

Climate change is a major threat to coastal ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest, which are already facing a range of challenges, including rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and changes in precipitation patterns. These challenges are having a significant impact on the plants and animals that live in these ecosystems, and are also posing a risk to the human communities that depend on them.

This project will investigate the impacts of climate change on coastal ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest. The project will focus on two main areas: (1) the effects of rising sea levels on coastal wetlands and estuaries, and (2) the effects of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems. The project will use a variety of methods to collect data, including field surveys, remote sensing, and modeling.

Sixth-year medical student, Satyen Hargovan’s honours research project has generated a check-list of the top 10 factors that influence the survival of sepsis patients.
Sepsis is a common medical condition, where chemicals released by the immune system to fight an infection trigger the inflammation and eventual shut-down of multiple organs.
Some 15,700 patients with sepsis are admitted to Australian Intensive Care Units every year. About one in five die. The cost of treating each case is more than $39,000.
“The burden of sepsis is not only in relation to patient outcomes, but also the financial cost to the healthcare system,” Mr Hargovan said.
His project, known as the Cairns Sepsis Model – 4 (CSM- 4) is designed to speed up the assessment of patients within their first four hours in ICU.
The new four-hour mortality prediction model will enable clinicians to detect patients who are at a higher risk of dying, then help to guide their treatment decisions and discussions with the patient and their family.
“Essentially it means that if a patient has a five percent chance of dying, you might treat them less invasively,” he said. “For example, you won’t rush to place them in an induced coma, or insert lines into large arteries or veins.
Mr Hargovan began his research by reviewing more than 50 mortality prediction studies, but soon realized that there was no model in the world specifically designed to predict mortality in adult sepsis patients within four hours of ICU admission.
A case history review of 500 adult sepsis patients admitted to the Cairns Hospital ICU over a four-year period identified 168 factors that could influence patient health outcomes, ranging from age, gender and socio-economic status to type of infection, degree of organ failure, vital signs, blood test results and treatment regimes.
Statistical analysis whittled the figure down to the 10 most significant factors, which include age, history of renal disease, level of consciousness, and abnormal levels of certain substances in the blood that represent varying degrees of organ dysfunction.
The mortality prediction model is inexpensive to use as it largely relies on information easily gleaned from patient history, physical examination, and blood tests that are routinely conducted on patients within their first four hours of admission to an ICU.
The next step involves testing his model on a different and larger set of patients in order to validate his research, before it can be accepted for clinical use.
“Then we’d love to create an online calculator or an app that clinicians can use easily, at the bedside, and have a result within seconds,” he said.

A James Cook University researcher has created a unique process to swiftly identify patients most at risk of dying from sepsis, a condition that claims the lives of more than 3000 Australians each year.
Sixth-year medical student, Satyen Hargovan’s honours research project has generated a check-list of the top 10 factors that influence the survival of sepsis patients.
Sepsis is a common medical condition, where chemicals released by the immune system to fight an infection trigger the inflammation and eventual shut-down of multiple organs.
Some 15,700 patients with sepsis are admitted to Australian Intensive Care Units every year. About one in five die. The cost of treating each case is more than $39,000.
“The burden of sepsis is not only in relation to patient outcomes, but also the financial cost to the healthcare system,” Mr Hargovan said.
His project, known as the Cairns Sepsis Model – 4 (CSM- 4) is designed to speed up the assessment of patients within their first four hours in ICU.
The new four-hour mortality prediction model will enable clinicians to detect patients who are at a higher risk of dying, then help to guide their treatment decisions and discussions with the patient and their family.
“Essentially it means that if a patient has a five percent chance of dying, you might treat them less invasively,” he said. “For example, you won’t rush to place them in an induced coma, or insert lines into large arteries or veins.
Mr Hargovan began his research by reviewing more than 50 mortality prediction studies, but soon realized that there was no model in the world specifically designed to predict mortality in adult sepsis patients within four hours of ICU admission.
A case history review of 500 adult sepsis patients admitted to the Cairns Hospital ICU over a four-year period identified 168 factors that could influence patient health outcomes, ranging from age, gender and socio-economic status to type of infection, degree of organ failure, vital signs, blood test results and treatment regimes.
Statistical analysis whittled the figure down to the 10 most significant factors, which include age, history of renal disease, level of consciousness, and abnormal levels of certain substances in the blood that represent varying degrees of organ dysfunction.
The mortality prediction model is inexpensive to use as it largely relies on information easily gleaned from patient history, physical examination, and blood tests that are routinely conducted on patients within their first four hours of admission to an ICU.
The next step involves testing his model on a different and larger set of patients in order to validate his research, before it can be accepted for clinical use.
“Then we’d love to create an online calculator or an app that clinicians can use easily, at the bedside, and have a result within seconds,” he said.

**Potential benefits:**

* **Early identification of high-risk patients:** The model can help clinicians identify patients who are at a higher risk of dying from sepsis, allowing for early intervention and treatment.
* **Guided treatment decisions:** By identifying high-risk patients, clinicians can tailor treatment decisions based on the model's predictions, potentially improving patient outcomes.
* **Reduced invasive procedures:** The model can guide clinicians to use less invasive treatments for patients who are less likely to die, reducing unnecessary procedures and associated complications.

**Next steps:**

* **Validation on a larger dataset:** The model needs to be tested on a different and larger set of patients to validate its accuracy and reliability.
* **Clinical implementation:** Once validated, the model needs to be implemented in clinical practice, making it accessible to clinicians at the bedside.
* **Further research:** Further research is needed to explore the potential benefits of the model and to develop tools for its implementation and use in clinical practice.","in the world specifically designed to predict mortality in adult sepsis patients within four hours of ICU admission.

## Luna's Meow

The sun shone warm upon my back as I basted in the afternoon heat, my purrs rumbling like a low, sweet song. The scent of honeysuckle and wet earth filled my senses, a symphony of fragrance carried on the breeze. The sound of birds chirping and leaves rustling in the wind danced around me, a melody that I mirrored in my own purrs.

I stretched, my emerald eyes opening wide, and surveyed my domain. My emerald coat gleamed under the sun, the silky texture soft to the touch. My ears, like antennae, picked up the faintest whispers in the air, the rustle of a leaf, the squeak of a mouse. My whiskers twitched, sensing the presence of a stranger in the house.

I crept, my senses on high alert, my feline agility guiding me through the halls. The scent of lavender and fresh bread lingered in the air, a testament to the humans' presence. The sound of their voices, low and soft, filled my ears. I felt their presence, their warmth, their love, like the sun on my back.

I found my favorite spot, a sun-soaked patch on the rug, and curled up in a ball. The scent of my own purrs and the sweet scent of the honeysuckle filled my nostrils. The sound of the birds chirping and the wind rustling in the trees continued to dance around me. I closed my eyes and drifted into a dream, my purrs deepening as I slept.

In the morning, I woke up to the smell of coffee and fresh bread, the sound of the humans bustling about their day echoing through the house. I stretched and yawned, my emerald eyes opening wide. The day was new, the world was fresh, and I was ready to explore.

I raced out of the house, my black fur flying, my tail held high. The scent of the park, the smell of earth and flowers, filled my senses. The sound of children playing, the wind rustling in the trees, all combined to create a symphony of life. I ran, I played, I explored, my senses alight.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the ground, I made my way back to my humans. I found them on the porch, their faces illuminated by the twilight. I climbed onto their lap, my purrs resonating with the evening. The scent of lavender and fresh bread lingered in","## Luna's Meow

I am making it weekly because they love it so much. The recipe is fabulous, but needed some tweaks. I doubled the recipe and added 2 eggs, used organic brown rice flour in place of wheat, and substituted 1/2 tsp garlic powder and hot water for the chicken broth. The cookies keep well in the fridge. I made these for my Yorkie/Rat Terrier mix and when they came out of the oven his tail was wagging just from the smell. He LOVES them. What can I substitute for the cheese in this dog treat recipe? I don't feed my dog cheese (let's be honest--it's basically junk food that doesn't belong in an adult dog's diet). Is there anything that you recommend substituting the cheese with? Or can I just leave it out? You could substitute the cheese for an 1/8 cup of ground flax or wheat bran. Is there something else I could use besides oats and wheat flour for this recipe? Chef's Comments ~ That's a great question. You can easily substitute the flour in this and most of our dog treat recipes. A few good grain free flours include almond flour, chickpea flour, potato flour and soy flour. Most of those flours should be available at a major grocery store. As far as substituting the oats, that's a little trickier, but it can be done. The oats are in the recipe for texture and soaking up moisture, so that's what you'll need to replace. First, you will want to halve the amount of oats and add an extra 1/2 cup of flour (or a mixture of the previously mentioned flours). Then you can add a 1/2 cup combination of unsweetened coconut, chopped peanuts and crumbled almond crackers. Or, you could replace all of the oats with the flour mixture. Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? If so, does it still need to be microwaved? Chef's Answer ~ That's a great question! :) I haven't tried this recipe with fresh spinach, but I don't see why it couldn't work. If you minced the spinach very fine, my guess is that you would not need to microwave, or otherwise cook, the spinach before adding it to the dog treat dough. Comments for Can I use fresh/raw spinach instead of frozen? Is it necessary to store these cookies in a Refrigerator? Since these are cookies, can it be kept in air tight container outside? And how long would it last if this is done? Chef's Comments ~ You can get lots of tips on How to Store Dog Treats on my website. Unless you live in a very cold climate, most dog treats need to be kept indoors, and even better in the refrigerator. My dogs is algeric to grain. What can I use instead of the whole whear flour? My Husky can't have grain. What can I use besides whole wheat flour. You should put more recipes with no grain in them. Chef's Answer ~ You can replace the wheat flour in most of my dog treat recipes with a non-grain flour. For example, any type of bean flour like Chick Pea (Garbanzo Bean) flour, or ""flours"" from nuts. They are technically nut meals, but they work as flour, for example almond meal. You should be able to find grain free flours at specialty grocery stores, or at health food stores. Very good simple recipe, however wheat flour isn't something I would normally have in my cupboard. Would it be ok to use plain flour or self raising? Chef's Answer ~ Yes, you can use all purpose flour in place of the whole wheat flour. I do not recommend using self-rising flour because it has the addition of baking powder or baking soda added to it. These are things that homemade dog treats do not need. Can fresh/raw spinach be used in place of frozen spinach in a particular dog treat recipe, and does it need to be cooked beforehand?","user

Generate according to: Onur Unal is Senior Art Director at Propaganda Advertising Agency in Istanbul.
It all started back in my childhood, I always interested in drawing doodles, reading comics and creating characters. I was inspired by humour magazines, and I was dreaming of become a caricature artist. I took courses on drawing technics, and after graduating from high school, I studied Graphic Design at Marmara University Fine Arts Faculty in Istanbul, Turkey.
During school, I got interested in advertising, and started an internship at Mullen Lowe Istanbul and TBWA Istanbul to practice on creative thinking and art direction. After that, I started to work for Big34, and a year after I accepted for Manajans/JWT. It was the most important years of my career.
I worked on important advertising campaigns of global clients, and won national and international advertising awards as Crystal Apple, Cannes Lions. I’m currently working for Propaganda Advertising Agency, and continue to design creative ideas for our clients.
I work for advertising agencies as an art director since 2009. I work for global and local clients as Nokia, Elidor/Sunsilk, Bosch, Shell, Turkcell, Mazda, Kia, Turkish Airlines, Hyundai, Nestle, Beko, Michelin, BMW, Red Bull, Mitsubishi Electric, Bayer, etc. I work mostly full-time at the office, and these days I also design mobile games with a freelance team.
I learnt that I should keep learning. As the technology and the design trends develop day by day, designers should stay updated. Last year I attended a design week about UX and digital design in London to learn more about digital design principles. During the week, I attended workshops at the design offices, and met designers from all over the world. It was a great experience to compare myself, and now I have new targets for my career.
I always try to find an exciting idea to get inspired. It can be anything – an interesting visual, a strong speech, a good music, anything. To find it, I make a quick research, take some notes and draw sketches. After, I brainstorm with our creative team and we share our ideas. Then the design process starts, I put on my headphones and focus on the design. After designing many alternatives, we make a discussion with our creative team and choose the best one.
The main materials I use are a blank sheet, a pen and creative thinking. All other tools and computer programs help to complete the final process.
Currently I work for Propaganda Advertising Agency. We have a beautiful office at the center of Istanbul with a nice view. I usually go to work around 9:30 am, have my breakfast while reading the news and after that the work begins. I work with a copywriter, and our team lead by a creative director. We usually make meetings at the beginning of the week with our brand executives, and we make a schedule for the deadlines. I usually work until 6:00 – 7:00 pm during the week, but under curtain some circumstances, we work overtimes and also weekends.
As my carreer began, I mostly worked on advertising campaigns, print materials, 360 ideas and digital advertising. Recently, I have been interested in UI, UX and digital design, and want to combine my creative background on advertising with the innovative projects.
During my short study in London last year, I had the chance to work and share my ideas with the designers all over the world, and I discovered things that I had never seen before.
I always believe that a designer should be in contact with all other designers and I want to cross the borders and surround myself with creative people around the world in my own studio.
